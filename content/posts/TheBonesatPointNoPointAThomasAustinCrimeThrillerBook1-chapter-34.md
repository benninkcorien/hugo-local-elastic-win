Chapter 33
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
Lucy floored it down Myrian Brightstone’s driveway and didn’t slow as she raced past the officers staking out the house.
After forwarding Anna’s second message to Ridley and Jimmy, Austin punched Heron Avenue into the GPS. They were thirty minutes away.
“Call her,” Lucy barked, accelerating around a truck on the winding road and passing it in the left lane.
Austin dialed Anna, but it went straight to voicemail.
Next he called Ridley. His number went straight to voicemail as well. The cell reception in Hansville was spotty, but it wasn’t non-existent. It was possible Ridley would hit a strong signal and the texts would come through even as the calls went to voicemail.
Lucy connected to Ridley’s channel on the radio. “Ridley, it’s Lucy, over.”
Surprisingly, he was there in an instant. “Lucy. You heard from Jimmy? I just got a weird, garbled message from him. He requested backup, but I couldn’t hear where he was. Even the radios are spotty out here.”
Her eyes showed fear when she glanced at Austin. “Did you see the text? Over.”
“No. Over.”
“Heron Avenue,” she said. “He’s gotta be at the Heron Avenue house. Get there now. Over.” Lucy swerved around a motorcycle and hit seventy miles and hour as she merged onto the highway.
Next Austin called the number of the Kitsap Union and, after a bit of a runaround, got connected to Anna’s editor. After introducing himself, Austin said, “She might be in trouble. Do you know how and why she ended up at a Heron Avenue address in Hansville?”
The editor was skeptical. “She was working all kinds of angles on that story.”
“You didn’t answer my question.”
“You served—what?—twenty years in the NYPD?”
“Yeah,” Austin barked.
“And you think I’ll explain one of my reporter’s stories to you? Her sources?”
“She texted us for help, you jackass. She’s in danger.”
The editor seemed to consider this for a minute. The part of Austin that was inclined to think the worst of journalists assumed he was considering which would be better for sales: one of his reporters getting a scoop about the case, or one of his reporters dying in pursuit of that scoop. He’d known editors to make such calculations in the past.
“I’ll tell you, but you have to send me screenshots of her texts. Just in case.”
“Fine, fine,” Austin said, impatiently.
“Now, please.”
Austin spoke through gritted teeth. “Does it strike you as odd that when she needed help, she wrote to us and not you?”
He said nothing. He wasn’t going to budge. Austin got his email address and quickly sent screenshots of her texts. After the editor had reviewed them, he said, “Can’t believe she offered you the tip on Heron Avenue, but, well, nobody’s perfect.”
“Get to it!” Austin commanded.
“Early this morning, she said that she’d been poring over old property ownership documents through the night. She was working on a follow-up to the story with the photo, trying to answer the question, why Hansville of all places?”
“Okay, okay…”
Lucy performed a series of lane changes right out of a racing video game, swerving to the right to pass cars clogging up the left lane, then cutting back in front of them and passing a semi by veering off into the shoulder.
“Told me it was just a hunch,” the editor continued, “but in the 1980s, the Houghton family bought a cabin in Hansville, off 360th there. Heron Avenue. More like Heron Dirt Road, but still. Anna went to high school with a girl last named Houghton. Never saw that cabin, they lived over in Poulsbo, but a lot of people owned little cabins back then. Everything was dirt cheap.”
Lucy hit the gas, topping ninety.
“And?” Austin asked.
“Point was, she said she looked into it on a few ancestry pages and Houghtons are cousins to the Bonner family in Seattle. Maybe second cousins. I don’t know. Point is: Mary Bonner, one of the missing nurses, is related to a family that owns property on Heron Avenue.”
Austin ended the call and slammed the phone down on his thigh. “How the hell did I miss it?”
The rain was coming in sheets now and, even with the wipers at top speed, the view out the front windshield was a watery mess. “We all missed it,” Lucy said. “Where is Heron Avenue in relation to the street where Trisha picked up the bones?”
“Heron is a tiny dirt road that extends east toward the water. Quarter mile, half at most, from where she picked up the bones.”
Lucy swerved into the left lane, passing a truck before cutting back into the right lane to pass an SUV. “So the chances that this is a coincidence are—”
“Zero. Mary Bonner kidnapped Allie Shreever, held her at the Heron Avenue cabin, killed her, and left the bones for Trisha to pick up. Then she kidnapped Joshua Green. My guess is that she’s got him there now.” He swallowed the burnt-toast dread in his throat. “If we’re not too late.”
