“Get me to open my fist,” he said bluntly. With that, I pinched, pulled, and pried with all my might trying to get him to open his gnarled hand. Nothing worked. Unable to get his fist open after several minutes, I finally gave up. He slowly lowered his arm and said simply, “Maybe you should have asked.”
The old man wouldn’t allow any of his horses to be coerced into being caught with such a cheap and unimaginative trick.
“You shouldn’t own horses,” I had heard him say a hundred times, “if you can’t catch ’em.”
“I’ll tell you something,” he said with a slight grin. “You’re not the first person that ever left a gate open.” The boot popped off his foot and landed on the floor in front of him. “And you sure won’t be the last.”
“Once you understand how a horse communicates,” the old man said, as he lit another cigarette, “you can understand how he thinks. Once you understand how he thinks, you can understand what’s important to him. And that’s the key.”
“Anybody can force a horse to do what they want,” he continued. “But if you force him to do it, it won’t be important to him to do it right. He’ll do it almost right some of the time. He’ll do just enough to get
The Cavalry boys had saddles, blankets, bridles with bits, and spurs on their boots. The Indians usually went bareback with nothing to stop and turn their horses with but a leather rope around the horse’s neck or around his bottom jaw. They got more with less.” He paused for a second, noticing that it had just stopped raining. “You can’t force a horse to be that way,” he continued, rising from his chair and walking to the door.

He said the outside of a horse may be good to look at, but it’s what’s on the inside that’ll tell you if he’s good for anything else.
I did learn how to ride a buckin’ horse. I got pretty good at it too. I just didn’t feel right doin’ it, knowin’ I probably could have got ’em broke without havin’ ’em buck.”
It was the distinctive clanging and banging of the old man’s truck pulling into the yard. With shovel still in hand,
A brief but heated conversation ensued, none of which I could hear. However, it was punctuated at the end with Buzz shouting, “You break horses the way you want to, and I’ll break ’em the way I want to.”
“No one treats my horses the way you did … no one.”
The final swing of the shovel did lay him out flat. The old man pinned his chest down with the end of the shovel and said something very quietly to him, which I was unable to hear.
“There, that’s the other thing this is used for.”
“You can’t judge a book by its cover,” he said. “It’s just like old Wil, but with people, sometimes all people need is a chance. Especially when they’re down on their luck.
He taught me that good horses, like good people, come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.
The only way you’ll ever find out if one is any good or not is to give it a chance.

time later to see what was causing the movement, which is exactly what he’ll do once he feels he’s put a safe enough distance between it and himself.
His response was a simple case of “better safe than sorry.” Get away from it first, then worry about what it is later.
Now I know better. Now I know that their entire make-up is designed for one purpose and one purpose only—survival. Theirs, not ours.
A horse’s eyes are where they are so that he can be eating in relatively tall grass and still see his surroundings. With his nose down, he can still see above the top of the grass.
“Hate women?” I asked. “Has he always been that way?” “I don’t think so,” she replied. “He’s just kind of gotten that way over the last year or so.”
Instead, it was the smell of a very expensive perfume, one that, had it been used with a little restraint, would probably smell quite good.
“I sure agree with that,” I told her, as I tried to move, undetected, to a comfortable place upwind. “But the reaction he has to you might not be a personality thing.” “Really?” she asked, moving her left foot to the bottom rail of the fence. “What other explanation could there be?”
“Sure,” he shrugged his shoulders. “I’d hate to get rid of him if we don’t have to.”
“That’s one option, I guess,” I told her. “Another one might be to not wear any perfume when you’re around him. Putting that stuff on his nose all the time could really irritate it.”
“He might make a good horse,” the man said, after about an hour or so of jerking and spurring, “but he sure don’t know as much as they said he did.” It was fairly obvious that this fellow had no idea what makes a horse a horse, and he didn’t really care. If he had, he would have taken a little more time to listen to what the horse was trying to tell him and then tried to help him through the trouble he was having.
What most people don’t understand, I think, is that once we see the horse’s point of view and understand the way horses see the world around them,
Empathy
A good horse with a sound mind, they feel, is better than a mechanical horse with no mind. What I mean by a “mechanical” horse is one that does things because, during his training, he has been forced to do them.
The good news is that there are ways of guarding against being taken advantage of—the best way is the simple use of a little common sense.
If what the trainer is saying or doing doesn’t sound or look right to you, ask about it. If the answer doesn’t sound right, question the answer.
“What do you mean?” I asked. “What I do here today is going to stick with her forever.” There was a hint of concern in her voice. “Yes,” I responded. “I believe it will.” “I never thought about it before,” she was still stroking the horse’s shoulder, “but this is kind of a big responsibility.”
“Working with these horses,” she replied. “Its kind of like raising a child, isn’t

It’s a responsibility, but not just a responsibility to the client. Even more important, it’s a responsibility to the horse. After all, its future is in the trainer’s hands.
“just because a horse is shiny doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be a good horse. The good ones, shiny or not, will show themselves to you.
The first change was in the time I arrive to see a horse that I’m interested in. If the owner wants me there at a certain time, I usually find myself arriving half an hour to forty-five minutes early. I’m always very apologetic for arriving early, but at the same time, I’m always interested in what’s going on with the horse when I do arrive.
I simply have either the owner or someone who knows the horse demonstrate how the horse works.
If neither the owner nor anyone else wants to ride the horse, then there’s a pretty good chance that I don’t either.
As a result, the woman had successfully misrepresented the mare by intentionally not telling us that she was a wind sucker,
“No,” Bill replied. “I’m sure he just stepped on a stone or something. Don’t worry, I’ll guarantee him sound. I wouldn’t sell a lame horse.”
He told Sandy that because the horse had just been checked, it would be a waste of money to have him checked again,
As soon as Sandy told him what the problem was, Bill became very belligerent, claiming that the reason the horse became lame was that Sandy had put him away hot after riding him, which was simply untrue.
