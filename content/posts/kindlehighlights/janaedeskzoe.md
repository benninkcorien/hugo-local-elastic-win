The name Marcus Johnson was written in that same blue handwriting above the prison’s name.
what it might say. He’d committed a terrible crime.
That was wrong, because my stepdad sometimes sang in the shower, and the acoustics didn’t stop him from sounding like a dying coyote.
I can’t believe you’re twelve years old. Wow. Do I sound like a broken record when I say that you’re growing up so fast?
I’m sorry I can’t be there to celebrate with you. I know your mom is doing something special.
Even if you never reply to these letters, I’ll keep writing them. Though I hope you’ll write me back one day. In the meantime, I want you to know that I think about you every day. Love, Daddy
chair. Then I cracked my bedroom door open. “Trevor’s here,” Mom said.
he’s not my friend anymore.” Not after he made our friendship out to be a total joke.
“When are you going to tell me what happened?” I shook my head.
Our families shared a two-family home—a
two-car garage. During the summer, my friends Jasmine and Maya always left town.
Mom didn’t believe in spending thousands of dollars for summer activities when I could have fun at home for free. Like always,
Trevor betrayed me and I hadn’t talked to him since.
only saw his face for a second, I knew what that look meant: (a) he didn’t want to be there either, and (b) he was still confused about why I was mad at him.
Well, I wasn’t about to tell him. He should be able to figure it out for himself.
“Why are you even here?” I asked. To apologize for what he said about me? To make it up to me on my birthday? “To give you your present,” he said. “I thought you’d be hanging out with one of your teammates.”
It was the best kind of summer morning—not too hot, not too sunny, and not too many mosquitoes out to bite me. Our dead-end street was quiet.
decided to write him back, just this once. Maybe I could get some answers—why he did what he did. Whether he cared at all that I was going to be born. Was he writing to me now because he felt guilty?
Trevor sat down on the other side of the steps and took a book out of his cargo shorts pocket—The Golden Compass.
The scent—a mix of chemicals and coconut—filled the air. “Do you have to be out here right now?” I took my earbuds out for a second and put my journal down on the step. Trevor looked up from his book. “It’s my porch, too. I’m on my side.”
couldn’t call him Dad. Paul had been my dad ever since Mom married him when I was five.
“What do you want?” “What’re you writing?” he asked. “Are you kidding me?” I stood up. “What?” Trevor rubbed one of his eyes. “I’m not talking to you.” “Why not?” “Because!” I said. “That’s not a reason,” Trevor said. Butternut barked and jumped up my leg.
“Why aren’t you talking to me? And why didn’t you invite me to your birthday?” There was a long pause
“Why aren’t you talking to me? And why didn’t you invite me to your birthday?” There was a long pause before I said, “I know what you said about me.”
But now it was exactly what I needed. I took out a sheet of the stationery—it was fancy white paper with one dark purple line going around the perimeter. On the top in script were the words: From the Desk of Zoe Washington

Passing notes wasn’t allowed in class, but nobody realized we were writing notes when we wrote them in a regular notebook.

I paused the episode so I could sprint to the mailbox. I was covered in sweat when I was done, but at least my letter to Marcus was on its way.

“If I won, the money could go into my college fund.”
“When does the filming happen? During school?” “I’m not sure,” I said. “And I assume you have to travel somewhere for the filming?” Mom asked. “I didn’t think they filmed in Boston.”
“Your dad and I looked at the website for the cooking show you want to be on.” I gripped Mom’s arm. “And?” “And . . . we’re not sure you’re ready for something like
what do you think about doing an internship at a bakery this summer?”
Ari gives you a positive review—then at the end of the summer, you can apply to the Food Network show.”
then I could still check the mail for a letter from Marcus
“Mom? Can I ask you something?” “Of course,” she said. “Would you ever let me speak to Marcus?” I asked. “Like, maybe send him a letter in prison?” Mom stopped walking and her expression got serious. “Marcus?”
“Right,” she said. “I’m not taking you to a prison.” “But shouldn’t I get to decide if I want to know him?” I asked.
Mom shook her head. “There’s still so much you don’t know.” “So tell me!”
He lies and manipulates people. And he’s a convicted murderer.
He lies and manipulates people. And he’s a convicted murderer. I don’t want him in your life. You have to understand.”
I had no choice—his letters would have to stay secret.
why a Black girl was getting out of a white man’s car. What we were doing together. My face got hot. “Hey, Dad?” I said, extra loud so the woman would hear. “Yes, kiddo?”
As I slipped my left arm into the sleeve, the letter fell to the floor. Address side up.
Trevor was in the back seat of Dad’s car when it was time to leave for Ari’s Cakes on Monday morning. I opened the front passenger door. “What are you doing in here?” Trevor shrugged. “I’m coming.”
“When are you going to tell me why you’re mad at me?” Trevor asked. There was no way I was going to talk to him about that here. But before I could answer, Ariana appeared. “So, Zoe, remember Vincent, our head baker?”
“You’re probably right,” she said, looking at me again. “I still don’t like the idea of lying to my daughter, but this situation is not normal. And I think your mom has been stubborn. She’s let her own feelings about Marcus get in the way.”
letters at my house. But I’ll read each of them first, to make sure they’re okay.”
“Yes. But you have to come clean with your mom,” Grandma said. “Before the summer is over.”
clutched Marcus’s letter between my fingers. He said he was innocent. Just thinking the words made me dizzy.
I should come up with my own new cupcake flavor. If Ariana liked it, maybe she’d add it to her menu. She’d definitely give me a positive evaluation at the end of this internship if I gave her a new flavor recipe—and I could use it for my Kids Bake Challenge! audition.
He worked for an organization called the Innocence Project, which he explained helped innocent people get out of prison.
then innocent people must go to prison. I couldn’t believe it.
Most of them were Black. Of course. I knew about the Black Lives Matter movement, how Black people all over the country were getting shot by police for no good reason.
Just like that, the story started spilling out of me. I told Trevor about everything between Marcus’s first letter arriving on my birthday up until the letter where Marcus said he was innocent.
I never lied to them this much about anything, and I felt a little guilty. But now that I knew Marcus might be innocent, there was no way I could stop. Maybe I could track down Marcus’s lawyer and ask him questions about the case. Or I could find his alibi witness and listen to their side of the story. If that person really did see Marcus
“I’m going to go use a computer and see what I can find about Marcus’s case.” “Cool, let’s go,”
His jaw was tight, his eyes stony, as if he didn’t feel bad at all. I started to panic; maybe this was all a mistake—he was guilty,

A witness reported seeing Johnson exit Hernandez’s apartment building the afternoon of her death.
“Nice.” After a long pause, I said, “I’m ready to tell you why I’ve been mad at you.”
“It started when you joined the basketball team.”
“You’re mad that I joined the team?” Trevor asked. “You knew I was going to.” “I didn’t think you’d start ignoring me.” “I didn’t,” he said. “Yes, you did. You didn’t talk to me as much at school.”
You were the one ignoring me.” “What are you talking about?” I asked. “During the summer, it’s always the two of us. But when school starts, you go back to Jasmine and Maya, and it’s like I don’t matter to you anymore.”
“I heard you guys. Last month.” “Heard who?” “You, Sean, and Lincoln. You were here on the porch after school. I was sick, so I stayed home all day. I was in the living room and the window was open, so I could hear everything.

Trevor swallowed hard. “I keep remembering what you said.” We’re not really friends. “I need more time to get over it.” Trevor nodded.

I sent an email to the general address, asking for information about the case, about an alibi witness.
I didn’t mention that I was a twelve-year-old.

Can you tell me the name of the alibi witness? Then I could find them and hear their side of the story.
Have you heard of the Innocence Project? I read about them at the library.

photo—it reminded me of Lucy Hernandez’s picture from the article. I hadn’t looked her up before, but now I wanted to know more about her.
Then I found a memorial page for her. It was a really simple website,
I hoped with every inch of my heart that Marcus wasn’t responsible, that this was all a big mistake.
“Grandma, can I ask you something?” “Of course,” she said. I took a deep breath. “In his last letter, when Marcus told me he’s innocent, were you surprised?”
I wrote to him and asked him to call me so we could talk about him writing to you.”
“You talked to him on the phone?” I was dying to know what Marcus’s voice sounded like.
make sure that he isn’t trying to hurt you in any way.”
“Marcus told me he had an alibi,” I said. “But I couldn’t find anything online about it. Do you think he’s telling the truth?” “He told me the same thing after he was arrested,” Grandma said. “Here. Let me grab a cup of tea, and then I’ll tell you what I know.”
I had to look him in the eyes and hear what happened in his own words. That’s when he told me about his alibi.” “What was it?” I asked. “He was at a tag sale,”
“The lawyer never even looked for her.” Grandma sipped her tea.
Like at somebody’s house?” Grandma nodded. “He said he saw some ad online and emailed the lady before going over there.”
“Exactly,” Grandma said. “She could’ve really helped Marcus’s case.
“To me, it was like he didn’t care one bit about what happened to Marcus.”
“I think he saw a Black man being charged with murder, and saw no reason to believe he was actually innocent,”
“Do you think Marcus is really innocent?” I asked. Grandma put
He never seemed like a violent person. He was always so polite and respectful.
“‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them.’
That quote usually refers to when someone shows you their bad side, but I think it’s also true when someone shows you how good they are.
“There was one time when Marcus was a senior. He got into a fistfight with another player at a basketball game.”
Marcus said that the other player, who was white, called him the N-word while they were playing.
It’s all part of systemic racism.”
“She was really mad at him.” “Why?” I asked. “Because Marcus was friends with the victim.”
Marcus said there wasn’t, but your mom, she had her doubts.
When Grandma explained it like that, I felt some sympathy for Mom. It must’ve been really hard for her.
But I wasn’t only a kid. And just because it wasn’t easy didn’t mean it couldn’t get done.
soon—he needs a miracle.” A miracle. I had a lot of work ahead of me.

didn’t want to believe it at first. But I was at the trial and I heard all the testimony. Marcus was the last person seen with Lucy.”
“He lied to me about hanging out with her at all. I couldn’t trust him anymore.”
“I know you’re curious about him,” Mom said to me. “I get that. But please don’t be mad at me. None of this is my fault. Marcus being in prison is not my fault.”
No—I wanted to figure this out on my own. I could do what Ariana did—bake a couple of small batches with different amounts of sugar, so I could see which one tasted the best.
the cupcake did sort of taste like Froot Loops.
Marcus’s call was scheduled for Monday afternoon,
“Marcus Johnson.” Marcus’s voice. My eyes widened as Grandma stood there watching me.
“This is a collect call from an inmate at the Massachusetts State Penitentiary . . . ,” before another person chimed in. “Marcus Johnson.” Marcus’s voice. My eyes widened as Grandma stood there watching me.
But then Marcus finally said, “Okay. Her name is Susan Thomas.”
don’t know where she was moving, but I don’t think she’s at the old address anymore.”
“She mentioned students at one point,” Marcus said. “I don’t know for sure, but she might’ve been a teacher.
“I really don’t want you getting involved with this,” Marcus said. “Please, just live your life and be happy, okay? That’s what I really want for you.”
“You know, I’ve been thinking that it’s time to tell your parents what we’ve been up to. It’s not good that we’ve been lying to them for this long.”
“Fine. You can keep writing to him. But no more talk about this alibi witness, okay?
If Grandma wasn’t going to help me, I’d have to find her on my own, without anyone finding out. There was an icky feeling in the pit of my stomach when I thought about lying to Grandma,
Trevor said. “We’ll find her, even if we have to message every single Susan Thomas.”
In the middle of the page was a picture of a Susan Thomas, who was a second-grade teacher.
Susan’s email was listed on the school’s website, next to her bio. “I guess I’ll send her an email, and see if she remembers Marcus,” I said.
There was a clear winner. The ones with less sugar and more-saturated cereal milk. It tasted delicious! It had the essence of the Froot Loops, without being too sweet.
The email was only a couple of sentences. Mr. Miller apologized for taking so long to respond, but then gave his phone number and said I could call him with my questions about Marcus’s case.
“You’re the one who sent the email?” Mr. Miller asked. “How old are you?” “I’m twelve.” What did that have to do with anything?
“So that’s it? You can’t help me?” “I’m sorry. I have another call right now so I’d better—”
She said she only moved to Brookline eight years earlier, so she wasn’t living there when Marcus would’ve gone to a tag sale. She wasn’t the right person.
“Susan Thomas Brookline MA professor.”
I scrolled down and found a list of classes that Professor Thomas would teach when the fall semester started in a few weeks.
School doesn’t start for us until September sixth. Maybe one of those days in between, we can go to Harvard and talk to her,
“Anyway, I don’t not like basketball,” I said. “You never asked me to play with you. It seemed like you only wanted to play with your brother or other friends.” “Sorry. I didn’t know.”

I almost burst into tears when she said she was the person we were looking for.
“I’m sorry. Maybe he looks a little familiar, but I’m really not sure. You say I met him at my house?
“He’s in prison right now. For something he didn’t do. At least, he says he didn’t do it. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth.”
I don’t specifically remember meeting your father. His name doesn’t ring any bells. I’m really sorry.”
write down your email address or phone number and I’ll let you know if I remember anything. Can I see the picture again, before you go?”
all I wanted to do was cry and scream and throw something.
“We’re going to be late,” I said. “And then our parents will find out
“We’re going to be late,” I said. “And then our parents will find out we weren’t at the movies, and I’ll be grounded for life.”
I told you she’s late sometimes.” I exhaled in relief. I couldn’t believe we were getting away with this. It was the one consolation for what had turned out to be a pretty disappointing day.
“We’re going to go home,” she said calmly, “and then you are going to tell me exactly what you were up to this afternoon, when

you really cared about me, you’d help me!” Grandma pursed her lips and shook her head slightly. “Ugh! I hate you!” I shouted. Right away, I wished I hadn’t said it, but I was too angry to take it back.
Now, before you—” “You what?” Mom yelled, looking back and forth between Grandma and me. I kept my mouth shut. “You had no right!” Mom said to Grandma.
“You’re kidding, right?” “Now, listen. You never gave him a chance to be a dad to Zoe.” “As if you don’t know
She knew that Marcus was going to send me a letter? I couldn’t believe it. “You’re the reason I never got any of Marcus’s other letters?” I asked. “I told you, I don’t want you communicating with him.” “What did you do with them?”
“I tried to tell you in the car. Professor Thomas emailed me to say she remembers Marcus.” My mother looked like she didn’t know how to begin

wondered how bad Trevor’s punishment ended up. If his mom was really going to make him quit basketball,
The next day was my first day of seventh grade.
Going to Harvard was pretty fun, too. Definitely the most exciting thing I got to do all summer.”
I want to visit famous colleges
Then I noticed Mom seemed upset—her eyes were slightly red, and her mascara was smeared. Had she been crying? “What’s going on?” I asked, scanning their faces. Mom cleared her throat before saying, “I spoke to Professor Thomas today.”
“You went to see Professor Thomas?” Mom nodded. “After our phone call.” “We both went so we could talk to her together,” Dad said.
“Yes,” Mom said. “She had a lot to say.” Dad said, “I asked her if I could record our conversation. We want to talk to a lawyer about what she said.”
He said he could use some stuff for his
He said he could use some stuff for his ‘Little Tomato,’ which is what he said he called the baby.
and I guess Marcus is a big fan. They talked for a while. But then Marcus said he didn’t need the futon after all. I guess while he was gone, he got a call from a friend who said he could have his couch. Marcus left sometime after that.”
He said the Innocence Project of New England is right here in Boston, so we can reach out to them.”

“If you want to talk some more about Marcus,” she said, “you can let me know. I understand that he’s part of your life now.”
“What’s all this?” I asked, pointing to all my baking stuff. “We want to bake something,” Mom said. “As a family.”
Mom immediately started singing along—sounding even better than when she sang to herself in front of the bathroom mirror.
“Of course,” Mom said. “Do you think you can forgive Marcus now?” “Oh, honey,” she said, putting her hand on my shoulder. “If Marcus really is innocent, I hope you will forgive me for keeping him from you all these years. I hope you understand why I did it, that I was only trying to protect you. I still am, the best way I know how.”

My eyes lit up. “Okay.” Mom put Butternut on a leash and we all headed outside. We walked down the street toward the mailbox,

was a little scary to visit a prison. First, we went through security, and then a uniformed guard led us down an empty hallway to the visiting room.
Our shoes tapped against the linoleum floor, and the fluorescent lights above us were so bright.
“I know you’re sad you couldn’t bring your cupcakes today, but why don’t you get Marcus something from the vending machine?”
The Innocence Project lawyers were working with him on that. Dad told me they were feeling optimistic.
At least I could show Marcus pictures I’d printed out of them in the window display at Ari’s Cakes. Mom had given Ariana one of my cereal cupcakes to try, and she loved them so much, she made it the special flavor for the month of October.
I didn’t care anymore that I didn’t get to audition for Kids Bake Challenge!

had no idea what would happen next, but I hoped with all my heart that the Innocence Project would set Marcus free. In the meantime, I was so thankful that I’d found his letter on my twelfth birthday, and that he was in my life now, where he belonged.
Marcus was actually there, in my house, celebrating his birthday.
The process of appealing his guilty verdict took a lot longer than I expected—years instead of months.
Not only did Marcus get justice, but Lucy’s family did, too.
Especially when it was the cake I helped make at Ari’s Cakes.
I’d gotten him some cooking supplies—an apron embroidered with “Big Tomato,”

He was working two part-time jobs—one in the office of a legal nonprofit organization in Boston, and he also started assisting Vincent at Ari’s Cakes.
“You got me a record player?” I said. “This is so cool.” Marcus grinned at me. “Let’s plug it in.”
found a plug for the record player, and turned it on. “The one thing about records,” Marcus said, “is that you can’t skip songs too easily.
Marcus and I both collapsed on the couch with big, identical smiles, and I felt grateful and happy and full.
My journey from aspiring writer to published author was long, a lot longer than I expected. I couldn’t have gotten to this point without my sheer determination, countless cups of coffee, or all the following people who supported me along the way. Thank you to my agent, Alex Slater,
I also want to thank Nicola DeRobertis-Theye for bringing Zoe overseas, and the rest of the Trident Media Group team for their passion and hard work.
One of the rewarding parts of having a long publishing journey is all the writer friends I made throughout the years. Thank you to my New School MFA crew—Kathryn Holmes, Michael Dobbs, Elizabeth Dunn-Ruiz, Benjamin Andrew Moore, Gabriela Pereira, and Mia Garcia—who’ve been there since I was a newbie writing my very first novel.
To Steve, the love of my life. You are the best husband I could’ve asked for. Thank you for being there for all the highs and lows of getting this book published and for always believing in me.
To Luna: I started writing this book when you were only a few months old. I’m so happy that you’re able to see me accomplish this dream, so you know that you can absolutely do the same. Shine bright, baby girl.
keep writing. This book is proof that hard work pays off and dreams do come true. I’m rooting for you. Finally, thank you to all my readers. I’m thrilled that I was able to share Zoe’s story with you, and I truly hope you enjoyed it.

That was wrong, because my stepdad sometimes sang in the shower, and the acoustics didn’t stop him from sounding like a dying coyote.
I can’t believe you’re twelve years old. Wow. Do I sound like a broken record when I say that you’re growing up so fast?
I’m sorry I can’t be there to celebrate with you. I know your mom is doing something special.

Well, I wasn’t about to tell him. He should be able to figure it out for himself.
“Why are you even here?” I asked. To apologize for what he said about me? To make it up to me on my birthday? “To give you your present,” he said. “I thought you’d be hanging out with one of your teammates.”
It was the best kind of summer morning—not too hot, not too sunny, and not too many mosquitoes out to bite me. Our dead-end street was quiet.
decided to write him back, just this once. Maybe I could get some answers—why he did what he did. Whether he cared at all that I was going to be born. Was he writing to me now because he felt guilty?
Trevor sat down on the other side of the steps and took a book out of his cargo shorts pocket—The Golden Compass.
The scent—a mix of chemicals and coconut—filled the air. “Do you have to be out here right now?” I took my earbuds out for a second and put my journal down on the step. Trevor looked up from his book. “It’s my porch, too. I’m on my side.”
couldn’t call him Dad. Paul had been my dad ever since Mom married him when I was five.
“What do you want?” “What’re you writing?” he asked. “Are you kidding me?” I stood up. “What?” Trevor rubbed one of his eyes. “I’m not talking to you.” “Why not?” “Because!” I said. “That’s not a reason,” Trevor said. Butternut barked and jumped up my leg.

“When does the filming happen? During school?” “I’m not sure,” I said. “And I assume you have to travel somewhere for the filming?” Mom asked. “I didn’t think they filmed in Boston.”
“Your dad and I looked at the website for the cooking show you want to be on.” I gripped Mom’s arm. “And?” “And . . . we’re not sure you’re ready for something like

then I could still check the mail for a letter from Marcus
“Mom? Can I ask you something?” “Of course,” she said. “Would you ever let me speak to Marcus?” I asked. “Like, maybe send him a letter in prison?” Mom stopped walking and her expression got serious. “Marcus?”
“Right,” she said. “I’m not taking you to a prison.” “But shouldn’t I get to decide if I want to know him?” I asked.
Mom shook her head. “There’s still so much you don’t know.” “So tell me!”
He lies and manipulates people. And he’s a convicted murderer.

I had no choice—his letters would have to stay secret.
why a Black girl was getting out of a white man’s car. What we were doing together. My face got hot. “Hey, Dad?” I said, extra loud so the woman would hear. “Yes, kiddo?”
As I slipped my left arm into the sleeve, the letter fell to the floor. Address side up.
Trevor was in the back seat of Dad’s car when it was time to leave for Ari’s Cakes on Monday morning. I opened the front passenger door. “What are you doing in here?” Trevor shrugged. “I’m coming.”
“When are you going to tell me why you’re mad at me?” Trevor asked. There was no way I was going to talk to him about that here. But before I could answer, Ariana appeared. “So, Zoe, remember Vincent, our head baker?”
“You’re probably right,” she said, looking at me again. “I still don’t like the idea of lying to my daughter, but this situation is not normal. And I think your mom has been stubborn. She’s let her own feelings about Marcus get in the way.”

“Yes. But you have to come clean with your mom,” Grandma said. “Before the summer is over.”
clutched Marcus’s letter between my fingers. He said he was innocent. Just thinking the words made me dizzy.
I should come up with my own new cupcake flavor. If Ariana liked it, maybe she’d add it to her menu. She’d definitely give me a positive evaluation at the end of this internship if I gave her a new flavor recipe—and I could use it for my Kids Bake Challenge! audition.
He worked for an organization called the Innocence Project, which he explained helped innocent people get out of prison.
then innocent people must go to prison. I couldn’t believe it.
Most of them were Black. Of course. I knew about the Black Lives Matter movement, how Black people all over the country were getting shot by police for no good reason.
Just like that, the story started spilling out of me. I told Trevor about everything between Marcus’s first letter arriving on my birthday up until the letter where Marcus said he was innocent.
I never lied to them this much about anything, and I felt a little guilty. But now that I knew Marcus might be innocent, there was no way I could stop. Maybe I could track down Marcus’s lawyer and ask him questions about the case. Or I could find his alibi witness and listen to their side of the story. If that person really did see Marcus
“I’m going to go use a computer and see what I can find about Marcus’s case.” “Cool, let’s go,”
His jaw was tight, his eyes stony, as if he didn’t feel bad at all. I started to panic; maybe this was all a mistake—he was guilty,

“Nice.” After a long pause, I said, “I’m ready to tell you why I’ve been mad at you.”
“It started when you joined the basketball team.”
“You’re mad that I joined the team?” Trevor asked. “You knew I was going to.” “I didn’t think you’d start ignoring me.” “I didn’t,” he said. “Yes, you did. You didn’t talk to me as much at school.”
You were the one ignoring me.” “What are you talking about?” I asked. “During the summer, it’s always the two of us. But when school starts, you go back to Jasmine and Maya, and it’s like I don’t matter to you anymore.”
“I heard you guys. Last month.” “Heard who?” “You, Sean, and Lincoln. You were here on the porch after school. I was sick, so I stayed home all day. I was in the living room and the window was open, so I could hear everything.

photo—it reminded me of Lucy Hernandez’s picture from the article. I hadn’t looked her up before, but now I wanted to know more about her.
Then I found a memorial page for her. It was a really simple website,
I hoped with every inch of my heart that Marcus wasn’t responsible, that this was all a big mistake.
“Grandma, can I ask you something?” “Of course,” she said. I took a deep breath. “In his last letter, when Marcus told me he’s innocent, were you surprised?”
I wrote to him and asked him to call me so we could talk about him writing to you.”
“You talked to him on the phone?” I was dying to know what Marcus’s voice sounded like.
make sure that he isn’t trying to hurt you in any way.”
“Marcus told me he had an alibi,” I said. “But I couldn’t find anything online about it. Do you think he’s telling the truth?” “He told me the same thing after he was arrested,” Grandma said. “Here. Let me grab a cup of tea, and then I’ll tell you what I know.”
I had to look him in the eyes and hear what happened in his own words. That’s when he told me about his alibi.” “What was it?” I asked. “He was at a tag sale,”
“The lawyer never even looked for her.” Grandma sipped her tea.
Like at somebody’s house?” Grandma nodded. “He said he saw some ad online and emailed the lady before going over there.”
“Exactly,” Grandma said. “She could’ve really helped Marcus’s case.
“To me, it was like he didn’t care one bit about what happened to Marcus.”
“I think he saw a Black man being charged with murder, and saw no reason to believe he was actually innocent,”
“Do you think Marcus is really innocent?” I asked. Grandma put
He never seemed like a violent person. He was always so polite and respectful.
“‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them.’
That quote usually refers to when someone shows you their bad side, but I think it’s also true when someone shows you how good they are.
“There was one time when Marcus was a senior. He got into a fistfight with another player at a basketball game.”
Marcus said that the other player, who was white, called him the N-word while they were playing.
It’s all part of systemic racism.”
“She was really mad at him.” “Why?” I asked. “Because Marcus was friends with the victim.”
Marcus said there wasn’t, but your mom, she had her doubts.
When Grandma explained it like that, I felt some sympathy for Mom. It must’ve been really hard for her.
But I wasn’t only a kid. And just because it wasn’t easy didn’t mean it couldn’t get done.

didn’t want to believe it at first. But I was at the trial and I heard all the testimony. Marcus was the last person seen with Lucy.”
“He lied to me about hanging out with her at all. I couldn’t trust him anymore.”
“I know you’re curious about him,” Mom said to me. “I get that. But please don’t be mad at me. None of this is my fault. Marcus being in prison is not my fault.”
No—I wanted to figure this out on my own. I could do what Ariana did—bake a couple of small batches with different amounts of sugar, so I could see which one tasted the best.
the cupcake did sort of taste like Froot Loops.
Marcus’s call was scheduled for Monday afternoon,
“Marcus Johnson.” Marcus’s voice. My eyes widened as Grandma stood there watching me.
“This is a collect call from an inmate at the Massachusetts State Penitentiary . . . ,” before another person chimed in. “Marcus Johnson.” Marcus’s voice. My eyes widened as Grandma stood there watching me.
But then Marcus finally said, “Okay. Her name is Susan Thomas.”
don’t know where she was moving, but I don’t think she’s at the old address anymore.”
“She mentioned students at one point,” Marcus said. “I don’t know for sure, but she might’ve been a teacher.
“I really don’t want you getting involved with this,” Marcus said. “Please, just live your life and be happy, okay? That’s what I really want for you.”
“You know, I’ve been thinking that it’s time to tell your parents what we’ve been up to. It’s not good that we’ve been lying to them for this long.”
“Fine. You can keep writing to him. But no more talk about this alibi witness, okay?
If Grandma wasn’t going to help me, I’d have to find her on my own, without anyone finding out. There was an icky feeling in the pit of my stomach when I thought about lying to Grandma,
Trevor said. “We’ll find her, even if we have to message every single Susan Thomas.”
In the middle of the page was a picture of a Susan Thomas, who was a second-grade teacher.
Susan’s email was listed on the school’s website, next to her bio. “I guess I’ll send her an email, and see if she remembers Marcus,” I said.
There was a clear winner. The ones with less sugar and more-saturated cereal milk. It tasted delicious! It had the essence of the Froot Loops, without being too sweet.
The email was only a couple of sentences. Mr. Miller apologized for taking so long to respond, but then gave his phone number and said I could call him with my questions about Marcus’s case.
“You’re the one who sent the email?” Mr. Miller asked. “How old are you?” “I’m twelve.” What did that have to do with anything?
“So that’s it? You can’t help me?” “I’m sorry. I have another call right now so I’d better—”
She said she only moved to Brookline eight years earlier, so she wasn’t living there when Marcus would’ve gone to a tag sale. She wasn’t the right person.
“Susan Thomas Brookline MA professor.”
I scrolled down and found a list of classes that Professor Thomas would teach when the fall semester started in a few weeks.
School doesn’t start for us until September sixth. Maybe one of those days in between, we can go to Harvard and talk to her,

I almost burst into tears when she said she was the person we were looking for.
“I’m sorry. Maybe he looks a little familiar, but I’m really not sure. You say I met him at my house?
“He’s in prison right now. For something he didn’t do. At least, he says he didn’t do it. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth.”
I don’t specifically remember meeting your father. His name doesn’t ring any bells. I’m really sorry.”

all I wanted to do was cry and scream and throw something.
“We’re going to be late,” I said. “And then our parents will find out
“We’re going to be late,” I said. “And then our parents will find out we weren’t at the movies, and I’ll be grounded for life.”
I told you she’s late sometimes.” I exhaled in relief. I couldn’t believe we were getting away with this. It was the one consolation for what had turned out to be a pretty disappointing day.
“We’re going to go home,” she said calmly, “and then you are going to tell me exactly what you were up to this afternoon, when

you really cared about me, you’d help me!” Grandma pursed her lips and shook her head slightly. “Ugh! I hate you!” I shouted. Right away, I wished I hadn’t said it, but I was too angry to take it back.
Now, before you—” “You what?” Mom yelled, looking back and forth between Grandma and me. I kept my mouth shut. “You had no right!” Mom said to Grandma.
“You’re kidding, right?” “Now, listen. You never gave him a chance to be a dad to Zoe.” “As if you don’t know
She knew that Marcus was going to send me a letter? I couldn’t believe it. “You’re the reason I never got any of Marcus’s other letters?” I asked. “I told you, I don’t want you communicating with him.” “What did you do with them?”
“I tried to tell you in the car. Professor Thomas emailed me to say she remembers Marcus.” My mother looked like she didn’t know how to begin

The next day was my first day of seventh grade.
Going to Harvard was pretty fun, too. Definitely the most exciting thing I got to do all summer.”

Then I noticed Mom seemed upset—her eyes were slightly red, and her mascara was smeared. Had she been crying? “What’s going on?” I asked, scanning their faces. Mom cleared her throat before saying, “I spoke to Professor Thomas today.”
“You went to see Professor Thomas?” Mom nodded. “After our phone call.” “We both went so we could talk to her together,” Dad said.
“Yes,” Mom said. “She had a lot to say.” Dad said, “I asked her if I could record our conversation. We want to talk to a lawyer about what she said.”
He said he could use some stuff for his

and I guess Marcus is a big fan. They talked for a while. But then Marcus said he didn’t need the futon after all. I guess while he was gone, he got a call from a friend who said he could have his couch. Marcus left sometime after that.”

“What’s all this?” I asked, pointing to all my baking stuff. “We want to bake something,” Mom said. “As a family.”
Mom immediately started singing along—sounding even better than when she sang to herself in front of the bathroom mirror.
“Of course,” Mom said. “Do you think you can forgive Marcus now?” “Oh, honey,” she said, putting her hand on my shoulder. “If Marcus really is innocent, I hope you will forgive me for keeping him from you all these years. I hope you understand why I did it, that I was only trying to protect you. I still am, the best way I know how.”

was a little scary to visit a prison. First, we went through security, and then a uniformed guard led us down an empty hallway to the visiting room.
Our shoes tapped against the linoleum floor, and the fluorescent lights above us were so bright.
“I know you’re sad you couldn’t bring your cupcakes today, but why don’t you get Marcus something from the vending machine?”
The Innocence Project lawyers were working with him on that. Dad told me they were feeling optimistic.
At least I could show Marcus pictures I’d printed out of them in the window display at Ari’s Cakes. Mom had given Ariana one of my cereal cupcakes to try, and she loved them so much, she made it the special flavor for the month of October.
I didn’t care anymore that I didn’t get to audition for Kids Bake Challenge!

had no idea what would happen next, but I hoped with all my heart that the Innocence Project would set Marcus free. In the meantime, I was so thankful that I’d found his letter on my twelfth birthday, and that he was in my life now, where he belonged.
Marcus was actually there, in my house, celebrating his birthday.
The process of appealing his guilty verdict took a lot longer than I expected—years instead of months.
Not only did Marcus get justice, but Lucy’s family did, too.
Especially when it was the cake I helped make at Ari’s Cakes.
I’d gotten him some cooking supplies—an apron embroidered with “Big Tomato,”

He was working two part-time jobs—one in the office of a legal nonprofit organization in Boston, and he also started assisting Vincent at Ari’s Cakes.

found a plug for the record player, and turned it on. “The one thing about records,” Marcus said, “is that you can’t skip songs too easily.
Marcus and I both collapsed on the couch with big, identical smiles, and I felt grateful and happy and full.
My journey from aspiring writer to published author was long, a lot longer than I expected. I couldn’t have gotten to this point without my sheer determination, countless cups of coffee, or all the following people who supported me along the way. Thank you to my agent, Alex Slater,
I also want to thank Nicola DeRobertis-Theye for bringing Zoe overseas, and the rest of the Trident Media Group team for their passion and hard work.
One of the rewarding parts of having a long publishing journey is all the writer friends I made throughout the years. Thank you to my New School MFA crew—Kathryn Holmes, Michael Dobbs, Elizabeth Dunn-Ruiz, Benjamin Andrew Moore, Gabriela Pereira, and Mia Garcia—who’ve been there since I was a newbie writing my very first novel.
To Steve, the love of my life. You are the best husband I could’ve asked for. Thank you for being there for all the highs and lows of getting this book published and for always believing in me.
To Luna: I started writing this book when you were only a few months old. I’m so happy that you’re able to see me accomplish this dream, so you know that you can absolutely do the same. Shine bright, baby girl.
keep writing. This book is proof that hard work pays off and dreams do come true. I’m rooting for you. Finally, thank you to all my readers. I’m thrilled that I was able to share Zoe’s story with you, and I truly hope you enjoyed it.
