The secret message is written on his scalp.
I never imagined that at the age of fourteen I’d excel at deception.
England on the brink of German invasion,
Fleetwood, my chaperone for the voyage,
I prefer being straightforward. My older brother, Jakob, used to be straightforward. Before Willa disappeared,
Willa is our mother. Killed in a bomb blast, they told us.
Willa is the only parent Jakob and I have left. I made a pledge to uncover the truth about her disappearance. I told my brother as much in my correspondence. But Jakob hasn’t responded to any of the letters that I’ve sent to the curious address he provided.
“Very good, Elizabeth.” I exit the cabin. Turn the corner in the hallway. Pull a deep breath. And then I run.
she showed up at the London address I use for mail—asking for me. And so I’m to go fetch her.
Those were the Colonel’s exact words when I was called to his office this morning.
He’d already returned to the paperwork on his desk. Conversation over.
know where you came from,” the man growls. “Well, I don’t. Where did you come from?” I ask. My brother shoots me a silencing glare.
London is bracing for war. I notice patches of yellow paint on all the letterboxes—those weren’t there before. The driver sees me looking. “That’s special paint,” he explains. “Meant to change color if it’s exposed to poison gas.”
You see, I do love Gran, but I’m not always certain that I like her. Family dynamics are complex things,

And she insists on formality. Demands it. To Gran, I am Elizabeth, never Lizzie. “Nicknames such as ‘Lizzie’ are reserved for barmaids and axe murderers, of which you are neither,” she once said. Not yet, I should have replied. But I’m getting ahead of myself.
I accidentally swallowed his favorite marble. It eventually reappeared but was no longer his favorite. “I’m sorry. I didn’t
I realize. My brother’s not only lying. He’s not only annoyed. He’s frightened.
I dash to my closet, grabbing and throwing things. The Germans are coming. Hitler is coming. What do you pack if you don’t know where you’re going or when you’ll return? Everything.

I wish I could just turn to her and say, “Look, Lizzie, I’m a cryptanalyst. A code breaker. It’s all very hush-hush.”
Cambridge. I had my feet up on my desk,
and reading through a new batch of American detective magazines, when a lecturer in algebraic geometry called Gordon Welchman poked his head through my open door.
“If you get a phone message that contains the phrase ‘Auntie Flo is not so well,’ come to that address.
Welchman stood, struggling a bit to get out of the chair. “They still talk about your father, you know.”
A town I’d never heard of. An address marked STATION X.
But was I interested? War work against Hitler? Most definitely interested. I’d

nanny at six?”
Evading capture, being straightforward, running long distances, making friends—those are just a few of my talents. Keeping secrets? It’s not one of my talents.
And, wait, did I replace the floorboard? I’m not inclined to tell Jakob about the book I stuffed into my pocket. After all, if he has secrets, I can too.
He’s clearly memorized the handbook for horrible brothers. But no matter. My resolve is steadfast. I will hunt down the truth about Willa and thwart anyone who tries to stop me. Gran and Fleetwood included.
I’ve never seen the diary before. Is it something Willa used for work?
She finds it amusing. “This is not a game,” I whisper. “Just do what he says.”

He grips my arm in a viselike talon, marches me a few paces down the hall. “Listen, Novis, we’ve got some new arrivals, a couple of young mathematicians. You’ll get them up to speed.”
“You know the machine,” he says. “Yes.” “You know how it works.” I nod. That’s the easy part: how it works. “Well, show them,” the Colonel orders. “Like us, they’ll have signed their lives away.”

We intercept German messages, but we can’t break the ciphers. And time’s running short. Hitler’s armies are rolling over Western Europe. Heading this way. “Bishop takes knight.” I jump, startled by the voice. But it’s only Nigel.
Did you hear that German troops parachuted into Holland disguised as nuns?” I can’t help but laugh. “No—is that true?”

The smoking man from the train platform is now sitting in the pub, tucked behind a newspaper. He sees me looking and gives a small wave.
She was there when the Germans rolled in with tanks and planes, bombing everything. If she’s alive, where is she? Why haven’t we heard anything?”
William James Jarvis, of the Security Service. Also known as MI5.
I notice a small door tucked into an alcove.
“Here we are, luv!” beams a stout woman wearing a stained apron.
Colin looks longingly at the map in front of him. “I’d much rather be flying a Spitfire with Simon.”
“So, you want me to pop that calendar lock?”

In a code, a whole word or phrase is replaced by letters, numbers, or some other symbol. A cipher is different—seemingly simpler. In a cipher, one letter stands for another letter.”
“I’m Beryl,” she says, handing me the chalk. “I think you dropped your pipe.”
Inside is a black metal device, the size and shape of a typewriter. “Meet your enemy,” I tell my students. “Enigma.”
“A million-plus ways to set up the machine. But if we had an army of cipher clerks, each checking one setting every minute, we could brute-force the solution in a day or so. The Germans knew this.

“Friends would. Just like you noticed my expression at the table this morning. But now that we’ve been straightforward, things are out in the open and there’s no awkwardness. Isn’t that a relief?”
Broken leg didn’t heal right. Didn’t imagine you’d notice.
It’s a mistake that turns Enigma messages into basic word puzzles. We’ve seen preambles with HIT and then three random letters. Say you see these letters in preamble—how would you decipher the second three-letter group?”
“So there’s the hope,” I say. “They make mistakes.

The commander’s brow narrows. “These are orders, Miss Novis. Not an invitation. When summoned, you’ll be given a large, sealed envelope and instructed where to deliver it.

am Elizabeth “Lizzie” Novis. Despite my good intentions, I often blunder, misstep, and stumble. And to be perfectly straightforward, let’s state the obvious: I am the candidate most likely to violate the Official Secrets Act. And I will be convicted of treason when I do.
“Actually, if you don’t mind.” The man falls in beside me. “I need a word with you. About Willa Novis.” I stop. Stunned. “You see,” Jarvis says, “we’d very much like to know what happened to her.” “We? You mean . . .” “Yes, the Security Service,”
To the US embassy in Warsaw. Her task was to help the embassy pack up, get the staff safely out of town before Hitler invaded.” He looks up from his notes.
Should I tell him about that? How Willa showed up at my room at the Mutton, right before leaving for Poland?
Weeks later, I found something she’d left in my room. A newspaper clipping with recipes and tips for homemakers.
It wasn’t till about the tenth time I looked at the article that I found Mum’s coded message.
1. The notations in Willa’s calendar diary are not straightforward. Colin pointed out that she has her own coded form of shorthand. Numbers, initials, symbols. I’ve been able to recognize references to myself as L and Jakob as J but nothing else. There are long strings of meaningless letters such
“Turing!” Nigel says. “I just saw him pushing his pram, with the shovel inside, and something else in there, something heavy, and it made the bottom of the pram droop way down, and he’s heading for Shenley Wood!
“Let’s see what Viola has to say.” I tear open the letter. Colin leans in close and we read together. Dear Lizzie, Imagine my surprise at receiving your letter and learning that you are still in England. My dear, war is upon us, and your mischief is most dangerous.
Tell Elizabeth this will not be tolerated. With God as my witness, my granddaughter will leave England.
Turing grabs the shovel and fills in the hole, stamping down the earth with his shoes. He kicks fallen leaves over the spot, then takes a small notebook from a jacket pocket and starts to write. “I bet he’s making a map,” Nigel whispers. It’s like something out of Treasure Island. I want to tell Nigel he’s got it all wrong. But how can I, after what we’ve just seen? Turing finishes writing. He puts the notebook back in his pocket, drops the shovel in the pram, and pushes it—with ease now—toward the road.

Invasion is imminent. Bombs will soon scream from the sky.
And suddenly, the quiet truth emerges. Many of these brave young men setting off to fight Hitler and save the world—they won’t return.
“It feels good. And it feels right. That’s what Simon told me.”
“Get a look at what’s going on in London.”
This business of Willa being dead. It makes no sense and to be quite frank, I just don’t buy it.” Olivia’s face. It’s undecipherable. “Have you spoken to your grandmother, dear?”
We looked everywhere for her.” I stand and begin to pace. “But to clarify—you did not witness her death,” I repeat.
And then I understand what Olivia is covertly suggesting. I sit back down and give her hand a squeeze. “This party. Yes. It will be the perfect setting for me to speak candidly with the ambassador and enlist his help. When and where is it?”
She’s sent her steward to take you
Mr. Fleetwood, he was at the embassy just thirty minutes before you.
“Hold on,” I say. “My mother was a cipher clerk?”
stand up. “I should get ready for work.” “Yes, by all means,” Jarvis says dismissively. I’m so sick of being bullied by this toothy scarecrow. I shouldn’t say it, but I do. “I have an important job, you know!”
I now have full appreciation of the phrase “run for your life.” I lead the mad dash to our flat, and as we round the corner it becomes very clear that despite his injury, Colin really should be considered for service.
“You didn’t see us!” I shout. Gibbs swiftly turns around, and we slip inside the building.
“That’s not what I mean,” he says. And then I understand. “Oh, Colin, you’re brilliant!” I turn in a slow circle, scanning the room. “Yes, I notice small changes. The sugar bowl on the table. That wasn’t there. Those two books that are off the shelf. The teacup next to the chair. I see it clear as day, now.” I turn and face Colin. “Someone has been in the flat.”
The changes are small, probably undetectable to most, until I get to Willa’s room. And then I gasp.
After a few long moments we hear the front door close. I reach for the doorknob. “Wait,” whispers Colin, grabbing my hand. “It could be a trap.”
“A rat in the American embassy. That’s big stuff.
The strings of odd lettering in Willa’s diary—what if they aren’t coded phrases, but actually words in Polish?”
“This woman. This . . . is Willa?” “Yes, why do you say it like that?” Colin looks at me, his face awash with shock. “Because I recognize her. I’ve seen her, Lizzie.”
“Willa came to visit you?” I sit up, wiping water from my forehead. “I was finally getting some sleep . . .” “Willa came to the Mutton?”
“Willa was here. She traveled all the way to Bletchley to tell you about her trip. She seemed different, worried. And you . . . you didn’t think to mention that to me?!”
I went to the American embassy to meet with Olivia McQuatters, one of Willa’s colleagues. She worked at the embassy in Warsaw. She was there when Willa arrived.” Jakob pauses near the window. “Wait, she saw Mum there, in Warsaw?”
“There’s something else I should tell you, Lizzie.”
As I move the thin newsprint over the bulb, tiny dots of light shine through the paper. Tiny holes—barely noticeable pinpricks—have
“Almost like . . .” I turn toward Lizzie. “Almost like she knew she wasn’t coming back.”
I know you’re angry, Lizzie, but I do wish you’d mend fences with your brother.”

where Ambassador Kennedy waits. “We’ll go up to my office,”
“Do you have confirmation that Willa is dead?” I interrupt. He closes the door. “No. I do not have confirmation of that.” Hope surges within me. He knows something.
“He died in a horse accident, you know,” I say. Beryl looks over from her maths. She tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Who did?” “Arthur Scherbius, the inventor. Run over by a carriage in 1929. Didn’t live to see the German military buy his machine by the thousands.”
“I’m thinking,” John says. “Say that again, Novis.” “Which part?” “About changing the ring settings.
Very slowly, a smile forms on his face.
“Eggs and fish” to describe bombs and torpedoes. “Devil’s piano” to indicate a machine gun. And the phrase “gone for six” means that someone has died.
“Mr. Fleetwood, I’m so glad to see you! Please don’t feel badly about what you’ve done. I’ve been
did not abandon you!” bellows Fleetwood.
The ambassador’s voice appears. “Slippery little weasel. Where’d she go?”
Pounding and hollering: “Welchman! Professor Welchman! Wake up!”
John, Beryl, and I exchange glances. We’ve worked out the idea together—now we have to explain it.
“Here’s our Enigma operator. It’s midnight. Time to reset the machine for the day. He rearranges the rotors and looks up the day’s ring settings.”
“We need to know these settings—but we can’t know them. There’s nothing about them in the messages themselves. Or is there?”
“Let’s say the first rotor’s ring is supposed to be set to H. I turn the rotor until H is facing me. Then I slide the notch on the side of the rotor until it aligns with the H. I do the same for the next two rotors—say W for the second rotor and B for the third.” John does this. He closes the machine. The letters H-W-B show through the three tiny windows in the lid of the Enigma. “The machine is ready,” John says.
“Send this,” I order John. “Immediately!” “This is where human error creeps in,” Beryl says. “We know about cillies. But some operators might make a different mistake.” “It’s easy to imagine,” I explain. “The operator has to pick a starting position for the rotors. Three random letters. Suppose he simply uses the letters that happen to be showing in these little windows? H-W-B.”
“It’s so simple . . .” Welchman finally says. “Could they really be doing this?” “Most probably don’t,” I say, “but we don’t need most. If only a few operators make this mistake, we’ll know. We can watch for patterns as messages come in this morning.
If we see the starting positions beginning to cluster around any three letters, that’s probably not a coincidence.”
“For twenty-four hours we’d have the ring settings for the Luftwaffe’s entire Enigma network!”
Planes. The rumble and thunder of fighter engines overhead. Marion gasps and grabs my arm. And we run.
“Blast, Lizzie! You scared me near to death. I thought you were a German.” He quickly gets to his feet. “Did you hear the planes? They were ours—RAF Spitfires! Those Rolls-Royce engines are unmistakable.”
He had such a lovely accent and when he asked me where I was staying, the words ‘in Bletchley’ just popped right out.” Marion throws herself face down on the bed in distress. “I’ve jeopardized the whole operation!”
“Your father’s Polish dictionary. The coded message saying he would be proud. And then she organizes the trip to Poland. A dangerous trip.”
“Lizzie, don’t!” says Marion. “The Secrets Act!” “What’s the Secrets Act?” says Colin. Silence. Marion and I stare at him. “You haven’t signed it?” I ask.
“It’s another coded message from Willa. And it means . . . she’s alive.”
We’ve tracked the starting positions on every message that’s come since midnight, charting the results on a sheet on the wall in Hut 6. We’ve come up with
Between that and the usual cillies, we’ve got two big clues about how German operators have their Enigmas set up today.
There’s a shout from the direction of Hut 6.
Beryl grabs my arm. “I think it’s working!”
Welchman throws an arm around John’s shoulder. He looks at Beryl and me. “This will not be forgotten,” he says.
Operation Fleetwood. I think our plan feels sound.” “Yes, but it relies heavily on spirits. What if he’s cautious?” I say.
“Now read it backward!” Marion says. I read it again: “zygalskirozyckirejewski.” “Rejewski!”
policy, we’ve noticed, that no rotor can be in the same position in the machine for two days in a row. A smart idea, right? Wrong. It’s unforgivably bad. Moving the rotors makes them easier to find.
So there are 5 x 4 x 3 ways to arrange them: 60 total.
But if you change every rotor’s position every day, you can’t use 28 of the 60 possible combinations.
You see, this is why the world needs mathematicians!
When an operator sees German on her tape she shouts: “It’s coming out!”
In Hut 3, one team translates the German into English. Another analyzes the intelligence in each message: what it means, level of priority, who needs to see it. From there, everything is relayed by phone or courier to high-level military leaders in London and beyond. A box of choice product is prepared each day for Winston Churchill.
They’re creating a catalog of decrypted messages on index cards. The idea is to be able to search for any message by any subject: names of German generals, specific ports or airfields, types of planes or weapons.
“Operation Sea Lion?” I asked. Beryl nodded. “That’s their code name for the invasion of Britain.
Welchman laughs. “Maybe you didn’t need to bury that silver after all!” What? Did I hear that right?
“It’s safer this way. If the worst happens.”
Invested his life savings in silver ingots and buried them in some secret spot.”
“The thing is . . .” Nigel stands. He brushes off his knees. “I moved the silver.” “What!” “I had to, Jakob!
“Safe,” he says. “Hidden. Here in the Park.”
stop and turn to face him. “Do you know Willa, Mr. Jarvis?”
Have you heard from your mother, Miss Novis? Or perhaps seen her?” The hair on my neck stands at attention.
Something isn’t right. I have to ask myself, could it really be a coincidence that a letter arrived yesterday from Willa?
“Because a daughter keeps her mother alive in her heart,” I tell him.
“Wait,” says Jarvis. “She was here? When was that?” Oh. That was a huge misstep. He didn’t know. I try to recover.
“Many of the classic motivations of spies.” “That’s impossible. She hated Hitler.” “We’ve been over that,” Jarvis says. “You didn’t know her.”
I was hoping Nigel would be around. I could use at least one friend. And there he is. Up in his favorite tree. He’s looking right at me. But he doesn’t say anything. No—please tell me no. He’s watching me now?
“I’ve heard Turing mention him.” “Well, let me inform you of something. Willa was with them the day she disappeared.”
No code this time. Except, instead of a return address, it says ‘53.’ That means something.”
hat do you mean, pack my things?” I ask. “This is my room.” “I’ve made other arrangements.”
Stuck somewhere where it’ll be easier to tell if anyone comes to see me?” Jarvis nods.
“Safe travels, Lizzie,” I say. “Give my best to Gran. And get Feetwart home in one piece.”
It’s been reported that Colin’s brother was shot down over the Channel. He hasn’t been found.”
It’s not wonderful. Nothing is going to plan. Operation Fleetwood is failing.
however I am able. I am undaunted. I am unstoppable. I am Lizzie Novis. And I will show them all.
Could that be it? I grab the box of matches, light the candle on the table.
A tiny dot appears inside the letter b of the green bean recipe. Then another dot a few lines down, below an r. Another below an i.

My sister’s right about one thing, at least. Mum is alive!
“Lizzie, you were right!” I scream. She probably can’t hear me, but I’ve never been so glad to say these words. “You were right, Lizzie! You were right!”
Finally, in the ad for Liver Salt, I found seven more dots of invisible ink.
That’s what the letters spelled. Goulash.

“And from this point forward”—the Colonel leans forward and stares at me—“you will report only and directly . . . to me.”
“They worked on breaking German ciphers,” I tell Lizzie. “All through the 1930s.
“There’s a simple explanation,” Lizzie says, and I can almost see the bulb light up in her head. “Willa is a spy!”
“For the Americans, don’t you see?” Her eyes shine with pride.
“Slumgullion! That’s the word for American goulash.

“My boy, we read everything,”
“Ezra Novis was one of the greats,” Dilly says. “Is that what you wanted to know?” “Not really,” I say. I wish I could think of a natural way to bring up the subject. I can’t, so I just jump in. “The three Polish mathematicians,” I say. “The ones who were working on Enigma before the war. I’ve heard Turing say you knew them.” Dilly stops. I expect him to ask me why I want to know.
with not much to show for it. That July, the Polish government extended a surprising invitation. They wanted a few British code breakers,
On the table were machines. They looked like typewriters but with rotors and bulbs that lit up. Knox and the others knew, in theory, what Enigma looked like. It looked like these machines.
Langer replied, “We made them ourselves.”
These were exact replicas of the German military Enigma.

Colin. My stomach is jumbled and sometimes I even lose my words. And, Jakob—you know me—I never lose my words. It’s annoying.” “I believe that’s what’s called a ‘crush.’” A crush. Oh . . .
What if these jumbled letters represent, say, ‘today’s weather report’?”
It’s from Marion! On the reverse side, in teeny-tiny cursive, she writes: Dear Lizzie,
It’s a folded scrap, torn from a newspaper. Not a column from Mrs. Bardell. It’s a crossword puzzle.
Turing checks the connections on the bombe as he talks. “Said she was supposed to evacuate with other American embassy staffers, but the car left without her. She needed a way out of town.”
9 Across: Source of bilious complaint  I find 9 Across on the puzzle. Eleven letters.
“The lake was in Switzerland. She can’t expect us to go to Switzerland.” Lizzie shakes her head. “No. It must mean something else.”
53? How does that fit in?” “A room number? Time of day?”
“Look, Mum’s been sending us these clues,” I say. “It has to be her. But why? Doesn’t that frighten you? Is someone forcing her? What if it’s some kind of trap?”
It’ll be all right. Lizzie won’t dash off to some mysterious meeting. She can’t go, in any case. She doesn’t even know where it is.
53 Old Compton Street, London.
“I’m sorry. I thought it would be a quick trip. I knew you were busy.” Colin’s anger softens. “Busy? Are you that daft, Lizzie? I wanted to walk with you.”
“I like you, Lizzie Novis. I really like you. Is that straightforward enough?
“But, Colin, there’s something—” “Just promise you won’t leave. Not until it’s safe. We can go together then.”
I must go to London.
“Nothing?” he whispers. “You have nothing to say?” His eyes fill with hurt. “Fine. I see how it is.”
My shift is over. I hate to leave before hearing “It’s coming out!” But today is my father’s birthday. Goulash day. A massive German attack is coming. Our mum is out there somewhere. Expecting us.
Nigel shoves me toward the back of the van. It’s piled with pigeons in cages, cooing and hopping about. I look at him and smile.
Lizzie’s handwriting. I pull it down, tear it open. Swiss Hotel, 53 Old Compton Street, London.
“I’ll drive you.” “No.” He looks up from his work. “Colin, no. Your parents, with everything that’s
Addresses are obscured. Dozens of gray barrage balloons float overhead. Directional signs point to air raid shelters. I turn in a slow circle. The sky is blue, but the city is the color of war.
A prickle of apprehension skitters up the back of my neck.
But nothing about this feels right. It feels wrong. Entirely wrong. It feels . . . like a trap.
“It was nine, you’re sure?” I ask. “The crossword clue?”
“Nine across!” We turn round. Room 10 is almost directly across the hall from room 9.
It’s neat and clean-smelling, as if it belongs in a different building from the rest of the hotel.
The Colonel closes the door. He gestures to the two chairs positioned in the room. “Please. Have a seat.”
I was never here. You were never here. You will never mention anything we discuss. Is that understood?”
“I encouraged you to abandon the search for your mother. Your persistence is admirable, but I feared it might land you in danger.
“As you know, your mother traveled to Warsaw to assist with the dismantling of the US embassy before the invasion. But unknown to embassy employees, that was not her only goal. She tracked down three Polish mathematicians,
She infiltrated not only the group of Polish code breakers, but also their families.

Your mother . . . is a spy.”

Our work at the Park is built on the discoveries of the Poles.
“From this point forward, your response will be that your mother was killed in Poland.”
“Apologies, sir.” She shifts the tray to one arm and out of the corner of my eye, I see movement. She snatches my burlap sack. The door shuts abruptly. My mouth falls open. Jakob gives me a silencing glare.
“So, did you recognize her right away?” “Immediately. Didn’t you?” “Of course! And she was imitating Viola.” I clear my throat. “‘Here we are. Just the thing, tea.’ And did you see? She swiped my sack!”
“The Colonel,” whispers Jakob. “Do you think he knew?” “Absolutely not!” I breathe. “She needed whatever was in that calendar planner and she was going to get it. But even more so, she wanted to see us, Jakob. And she wanted us to see her.
Jakob. That is the greatest compliment.” I stand, grabbing her passport from the chair. “So, let’s go find her!”
“What’s this?” Lizzie asks, reaching in. She pulls out a piece of paper and unfolds it. A sheet of Swiss Hotel stationery. A short note, in Mum’s familiar handwriting:
“But she knows where to find us,” I say. “She’ll be in touch.” “The recipes . . .” Lizzie says, touching the words on the note.
Black planes, rows and rows of them, high above the city. Arranged in neat formations, almost like pieces on a game board. “Take cover!” the wardens yell. “Take cover at once!”
The Germans have arrived. Hitler’s wrath is descending.
“Dad,” Jakob says. “He was in it too, you know.” “In what?” He lowers his voice. “The same sort of work as me.
Lizzie and I walk around the car. Berrycloth’s precious motorcar. It must have been hit by falling wreckage. It’s dented all over. The headlights are smashed. The windshield is simply gone. “Not too bad,” Lizzie says. “Maybe he won’t notice.” Once again in a terrible moment, my sister makes me laugh.
Welchman cleared his throat. “Sea Lion postponed until spring.”
“Get ’em next year.” “Maybe not,” I say. “Hank Greenberg just registered for the draft, one of the first big leaguers to do it.”

it was important to us to feature the contributions of at least a few of the real-life code breakers, such as Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, and Dilly Knox.
Cambridge student named John Herivel, just twenty-one at the time, had the insight—while half-asleep in a chair—that careless Enigma operators might be giving away the machine’s ring settings. This was the inspiration for the breakthrough in Chapter 45 of our book.

when he returned to the spot after the war, he was unable to find the treasure.
Finally, in the 1970s, the British government began allowing Bletchley veterans to tell their stories.
Many did, and these first-hand accounts were an invaluable source for this book. Some refused to talk; they’d vowed to keep the secret for life and did just that.
When we traveled to Britain in the spring of 2022, Dr. David Kenyon—the research historian at Bletchley Park—generously answered many questions and offered invaluable insights.


As a fan of The Bletchley Circle and The Bletchley Circle San Fransisco TV series, this book and its cover immediately caught my eye.

It is set against the backdrop of World War II. I live in the Netherlands and grew up with plenty of WWII stories/history from books, school and a bit from my grandparents, but this still added something new: Bletchley Park and two teens during the very early war years, working with and amongst the Bletchley code-breakers.

The chapters took a little getting used to, with the back and forth between the two perspectives of Lizzie (an incredibly precocious 14-year-old) and her level-headed older brother Jakob (19, but reads a bit younger).

Their mother is presumed dead, and the war threat is ever increasing.
Gran likes to keep Lizzie safe, bring her to America and turn her into a proper lady. Lizzie is having none of that and outsmarts her chaperone.
When mysterious clues show up, Lizzy thinks they may relate to their mom's disappearance, but Jakob reminds her that, with all the spies around, you never know who you can trust. It might be a trap.

The authors added in plenty of real historical facts, I loved learning about the Polish mathematicians who originally worked on Enigma! And of course the real Bletchley people, and Turing on his bicycle.The secret message is written on his scalp.

Willa is our mother. Killed in a bomb blast, they told us.
Willa is the only parent Jakob and I have left. I made a pledge to uncover the truth about her disappearance. I told my brother as much in my correspondence. But Jakob hasn’t responded to any of the letters that I’ve sent to the curious address he provided.
“Very good, Elizabeth.” I exit the cabin. Turn the corner in the hallway. Pull a deep breath. And then I run.

London is bracing for war. I notice patches of yellow paint on all the letterboxes—those weren’t there before. The driver sees me looking. “That’s special paint,” he explains. “Meant to change color if it’s exposed to poison gas.”

And she insists on formality. Demands it. To Gran, I am Elizabeth, never Lizzie. “Nicknames such as ‘Lizzie’ are reserved for barmaids and axe murderers, of which you are neither,” she once said. Not yet, I should have replied. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Evading capture, being straightforward, running long distances, making friends—those are just a few of my talents. Keeping secrets? It’s not one of my talents.
And, wait, did I replace the floorboard? I’m not inclined to tell Jakob about the book I stuffed into my pocket. After all, if he has secrets, I can too.
He’s clearly memorized the handbook for horrible brothers. But no matter. My resolve is steadfast. I will hunt down the truth about Willa and thwart anyone who tries to stop me. Gran and Fleetwood included.
I’ve never seen the diary before. Is it something Willa used for work?
She finds it amusing. “This is not a game,” I whisper. “Just do what he says.”

He grips my arm in a viselike talon, marches me a few paces down the hall. “Listen, Novis, we’ve got some new arrivals, a couple of young mathematicians. You’ll get them up to speed.”
“You know the machine,” he says. “Yes.” “You know how it works.” I nod. That’s the easy part: how it works. “Well, show them,” the Colonel orders. “Like us, they’ll have signed their lives away.”

“Actually, if you don’t mind.” The man falls in beside me. “I need a word with you. About Willa Novis.” I stop. Stunned. “You see,” Jarvis says, “we’d very much like to know what happened to her.” “We? You mean . . .” “Yes, the Security Service,”
To the US embassy in Warsaw. Her task was to help the embassy pack up, get the staff safely out of town before Hitler invaded.” He looks up from his notes.
Should I tell him about that? How Willa showed up at my room at the Mutton, right before leaving for Poland?
Weeks later, I found something she’d left in my room. A newspaper clipping with recipes and tips for homemakers.
It wasn’t till about the tenth time I looked at the article that I found Mum’s coded message.

“Turing!” Nigel says. “I just saw him pushing his pram, with the shovel inside, and something else in there, something heavy, and it made the bottom of the pram droop way down, and he’s heading for Shenley Wood!
“Let’s see what Viola has to say.” I tear open the letter. Colin leans in close and we read together. Dear Lizzie, Imagine my surprise at receiving your letter and learning that you are still in England. My dear, war is upon us, and your mischief is most dangerous.
Tell Elizabeth this will not be tolerated. With God as my witness, my granddaughter will leave England.
Turing grabs the shovel and fills in the hole, stamping down the earth with his shoes. He kicks fallen leaves over the spot, then takes a small notebook from a jacket pocket and starts to write. “I bet he’s making a map,” Nigel whispers. It’s like something out of Treasure Island. I want to tell Nigel he’s got it all wrong. But how can I, after what we’ve just seen? Turing finishes writing. He puts the notebook back in his pocket, drops the shovel in the pram, and pushes it—with ease now—toward the road.

And suddenly, the quiet truth emerges. Many of these brave young men setting off to fight Hitler and save the world—they won’t return.

We looked everywhere for her.” I stand and begin to pace. “But to clarify—you did not witness her death,” I repeat.
And then I understand what Olivia is covertly suggesting. I sit back down and give her hand a squeeze. “This party. Yes. It will be the perfect setting for me to speak candidly with the ambassador and enlist his help. When and where is it?”
She’s sent her steward to take you

stand up. “I should get ready for work.” “Yes, by all means,” Jarvis says dismissively. I’m so sick of being bullied by this toothy scarecrow. I shouldn’t say it, but I do. “I have an important job, you know!”
I now have full appreciation of the phrase “run for your life.” I lead the mad dash to our flat, and as we round the corner it becomes very clear that despite his injury, Colin really should be considered for service.
“You didn’t see us!” I shout. Gibbs swiftly turns around, and we slip inside the building.
“That’s not what I mean,” he says. And then I understand. “Oh, Colin, you’re brilliant!” I turn in a slow circle, scanning the room. “Yes, I notice small changes. The sugar bowl on the table. That wasn’t there. Those two books that are off the shelf. The teacup next to the chair. I see it clear as day, now.” I turn and face Colin. “Someone has been in the flat.”
The changes are small, probably undetectable to most, until I get to Willa’s room. And then I gasp.
After a few long moments we hear the front door close. I reach for the doorknob. “Wait,” whispers Colin, grabbing my hand. “It could be a trap.”
“A rat in the American embassy. That’s big stuff.
The strings of odd lettering in Willa’s diary—what if they aren’t coded phrases, but actually words in Polish?”
“This woman. This . . . is Willa?” “Yes, why do you say it like that?” Colin looks at me, his face awash with shock. “Because I recognize her. I’ve seen her, Lizzie.”
“Willa came to visit you?” I sit up, wiping water from my forehead. “I was finally getting some sleep . . .” “Willa came to the Mutton?”
“Willa was here. She traveled all the way to Bletchley to tell you about her trip. She seemed different, worried. And you . . . you didn’t think to mention that to me?!”
I went to the American embassy to meet with Olivia McQuatters, one of Willa’s colleagues. She worked at the embassy in Warsaw. She was there when Willa arrived.” Jakob pauses near the window. “Wait, she saw Mum there, in Warsaw?”
“There’s something else I should tell you, Lizzie.”
As I move the thin newsprint over the bulb, tiny dots of light shine through the paper. Tiny holes—barely noticeable pinpricks—have

where Ambassador Kennedy waits. “We’ll go up to my office,”
“Do you have confirmation that Willa is dead?” I interrupt. He closes the door. “No. I do not have confirmation of that.” Hope surges within me. He knows something.
“He died in a horse accident, you know,” I say. Beryl looks over from her maths. She tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Who did?” “Arthur Scherbius, the inventor. Run over by a carriage in 1929. Didn’t live to see the German military buy his machine by the thousands.”
“I’m thinking,” John says. “Say that again, Novis.” “Which part?” “About changing the ring settings.
Very slowly, a smile forms on his face.

The ambassador’s voice appears. “Slippery little weasel. Where’d she go?”
Pounding and hollering: “Welchman! Professor Welchman! Wake up!”
John, Beryl, and I exchange glances. We’ve worked out the idea together—now we have to explain it.
“Here’s our Enigma operator. It’s midnight. Time to reset the machine for the day. He rearranges the rotors and looks up the day’s ring settings.”
“We need to know these settings—but we can’t know them. There’s nothing about them in the messages themselves. Or is there?”
“Let’s say the first rotor’s ring is supposed to be set to H. I turn the rotor until H is facing me. Then I slide the notch on the side of the rotor until it aligns with the H. I do the same for the next two rotors—say W for the second rotor and B for the third.” John does this. He closes the machine. The letters H-W-B show through the three tiny windows in the lid of the Enigma. “The machine is ready,” John says.
“Send this,” I order John. “Immediately!” “This is where human error creeps in,” Beryl says. “We know about cillies. But some operators might make a different mistake.” “It’s easy to imagine,” I explain. “The operator has to pick a starting position for the rotors. Three random letters. Suppose he simply uses the letters that happen to be showing in these little windows? H-W-B.”
“It’s so simple . . .” Welchman finally says. “Could they really be doing this?” “Most probably don’t,” I say, “but we don’t need most. If only a few operators make this mistake, we’ll know. We can watch for patterns as messages come in this morning.
If we see the starting positions beginning to cluster around any three letters, that’s probably not a coincidence.”
“For twenty-four hours we’d have the ring settings for the Luftwaffe’s entire Enigma network!”
Planes. The rumble and thunder of fighter engines overhead. Marion gasps and grabs my arm. And we run.
“Blast, Lizzie! You scared me near to death. I thought you were a German.” He quickly gets to his feet. “Did you hear the planes? They were ours—RAF Spitfires! Those Rolls-Royce engines are unmistakable.”
He had such a lovely accent and when he asked me where I was staying, the words ‘in Bletchley’ just popped right out.” Marion throws herself face down on the bed in distress. “I’ve jeopardized the whole operation!”
“Your father’s Polish dictionary. The coded message saying he would be proud. And then she organizes the trip to Poland. A dangerous trip.”
“Lizzie, don’t!” says Marion. “The Secrets Act!” “What’s the Secrets Act?” says Colin. Silence. Marion and I stare at him. “You haven’t signed it?” I ask.
“It’s another coded message from Willa. And it means . . . she’s alive.”
We’ve tracked the starting positions on every message that’s come since midnight, charting the results on a sheet on the wall in Hut 6. We’ve come up with
Between that and the usual cillies, we’ve got two big clues about how German operators have their Enigmas set up today.
There’s a shout from the direction of Hut 6.
Beryl grabs my arm. “I think it’s working!”
Welchman throws an arm around John’s shoulder. He looks at Beryl and me. “This will not be forgotten,” he says.
Operation Fleetwood. I think our plan feels sound.” “Yes, but it relies heavily on spirits. What if he’s cautious?” I say.
“Now read it backward!” Marion says. I read it again: “zygalskirozyckirejewski.” “Rejewski!”
policy, we’ve noticed, that no rotor can be in the same position in the machine for two days in a row. A smart idea, right? Wrong. It’s unforgivably bad. Moving the rotors makes them easier to find.
So there are 5 x 4 x 3 ways to arrange them: 60 total.
But if you change every rotor’s position every day, you can’t use 28 of the 60 possible combinations.
You see, this is why the world needs mathematicians!
When an operator sees German on her tape she shouts: “It’s coming out!”
In Hut 3, one team translates the German into English. Another analyzes the intelligence in each message: what it means, level of priority, who needs to see it. From there, everything is relayed by phone or courier to high-level military leaders in London and beyond. A box of choice product is prepared each day for Winston Churchill.
They’re creating a catalog of decrypted messages on index cards. The idea is to be able to search for any message by any subject: names of German generals, specific ports or airfields, types of planes or weapons.
“Operation Sea Lion?” I asked. Beryl nodded. “That’s their code name for the invasion of Britain.
Welchman laughs. “Maybe you didn’t need to bury that silver after all!” What? Did I hear that right?
“It’s safer this way. If the worst happens.”
Invested his life savings in silver ingots and buried them in some secret spot.”
“The thing is . . .” Nigel stands. He brushes off his knees. “I moved the silver.” “What!” “I had to, Jakob!
“Safe,” he says. “Hidden. Here in the Park.”
stop and turn to face him. “Do you know Willa, Mr. Jarvis?”
Have you heard from your mother, Miss Novis? Or perhaps seen her?” The hair on my neck stands at attention.
Something isn’t right. I have to ask myself, could it really be a coincidence that a letter arrived yesterday from Willa?
“Because a daughter keeps her mother alive in her heart,” I tell him.
“Wait,” says Jarvis. “She was here? When was that?” Oh. That was a huge misstep. He didn’t know. I try to recover.
“Many of the classic motivations of spies.” “That’s impossible. She hated Hitler.” “We’ve been over that,” Jarvis says. “You didn’t know her.”
I was hoping Nigel would be around. I could use at least one friend. And there he is. Up in his favorite tree. He’s looking right at me. But he doesn’t say anything. No—please tell me no. He’s watching me now?
“I’ve heard Turing mention him.” “Well, let me inform you of something. Willa was with them the day she disappeared.”
No code this time. Except, instead of a return address, it says ‘53.’ That means something.”

Stuck somewhere where it’ll be easier to tell if anyone comes to see me?” Jarvis nods.
“Safe travels, Lizzie,” I say. “Give my best to Gran. And get Feetwart home in one piece.”
It’s been reported that Colin’s brother was shot down over the Channel. He hasn’t been found.”
It’s not wonderful. Nothing is going to plan. Operation Fleetwood is failing.

What if these jumbled letters represent, say, ‘today’s weather report’?”
It’s from Marion! On the reverse side, in teeny-tiny cursive, she writes: Dear Lizzie,
It’s a folded scrap, torn from a newspaper. Not a column from Mrs. Bardell. It’s a crossword puzzle.
Turing checks the connections on the bombe as he talks. “Said she was supposed to evacuate with other American embassy staffers, but the car left without her. She needed a way out of town.”
9 Across: Source of bilious complaint  I find 9 Across on the puzzle. Eleven letters.
“The lake was in Switzerland. She can’t expect us to go to Switzerland.” Lizzie shakes her head. “No. It must mean something else.”
53? How does that fit in?” “A room number? Time of day?”
“Look, Mum’s been sending us these clues,” I say. “It has to be her. But why? Doesn’t that frighten you? Is someone forcing her? What if it’s some kind of trap?”
It’ll be all right. Lizzie won’t dash off to some mysterious meeting. She can’t go, in any case. She doesn’t even know where it is.
53 Old Compton Street, London.
“I’m sorry. I thought it would be a quick trip. I knew you were busy.” Colin’s anger softens. “Busy? Are you that daft, Lizzie? I wanted to walk with you.”
“I like you, Lizzie Novis. I really like you. Is that straightforward enough?
“But, Colin, there’s something—” “Just promise you won’t leave. Not until it’s safe. We can go together then.”
I must go to London.
“Nothing?” he whispers. “You have nothing to say?” His eyes fill with hurt. “Fine. I see how it is.”
My shift is over. I hate to leave before hearing “It’s coming out!” But today is my father’s birthday. Goulash day. A massive German attack is coming. Our mum is out there somewhere. Expecting us.
Nigel shoves me toward the back of the van. It’s piled with pigeons in cages, cooing and hopping about. I look at him and smile.

Addresses are obscured. Dozens of gray barrage balloons float overhead. Directional signs point to air raid shelters. I turn in a slow circle. The sky is blue, but the city is the color of war.
A prickle of apprehension skitters up the back of my neck.
But nothing about this feels right. It feels wrong. Entirely wrong. It feels . . . like a trap.
“It was nine, you’re sure?” I ask. “The crossword clue?”
“Nine across!” We turn round. Room 10 is almost directly across the hall from room 9.
It’s neat and clean-smelling, as if it belongs in a different building from the rest of the hotel.
The Colonel closes the door. He gestures to the two chairs positioned in the room. “Please. Have a seat.”
I was never here. You were never here. You will never mention anything we discuss. Is that understood?”
“I encouraged you to abandon the search for your mother. Your persistence is admirable, but I feared it might land you in danger.
“As you know, your mother traveled to Warsaw to assist with the dismantling of the US embassy before the invasion. But unknown to embassy employees, that was not her only goal. She tracked down three Polish mathematicians,

“From this point forward, your response will be that your mother was killed in Poland.”
“Apologies, sir.” She shifts the tray to one arm and out of the corner of my eye, I see movement. She snatches my burlap sack. The door shuts abruptly. My mouth falls open. Jakob gives me a silencing glare.
“So, did you recognize her right away?” “Immediately. Didn’t you?” “Of course! And she was imitating Viola.” I clear my throat. “‘Here we are. Just the thing, tea.’ And did you see? She swiped my sack!”
“The Colonel,” whispers Jakob. “Do you think he knew?” “Absolutely not!” I breathe. “She needed whatever was in that calendar planner and she was going to get it. But even more so, she wanted to see us, Jakob. And she wanted us to see her.
Jakob. That is the greatest compliment.” I stand, grabbing her passport from the chair. “So, let’s go find her!”
“What’s this?” Lizzie asks, reaching in. She pulls out a piece of paper and unfolds it. A sheet of Swiss Hotel stationery. A short note, in Mum’s familiar handwriting:
“But she knows where to find us,” I say. “She’ll be in touch.” “The recipes . . .” Lizzie says, touching the words on the note.
Black planes, rows and rows of them, high above the city. Arranged in neat formations, almost like pieces on a game board. “Take cover!” the wardens yell. “Take cover at once!”
The Germans have arrived. Hitler’s wrath is descending.
“Dad,” Jakob says. “He was in it too, you know.” “In what?” He lowers his voice. “The same sort of work as me.
Lizzie and I walk around the car. Berrycloth’s precious motorcar. It must have been hit by falling wreckage. It’s dented all over. The headlights are smashed. The windshield is simply gone. “Not too bad,” Lizzie says. “Maybe he won’t notice.” Once again in a terrible moment, my sister makes me laugh.
Welchman cleared his throat. “Sea Lion postponed until spring.”
“Get ’em next year.” “Maybe not,” I say. “Hank Greenberg just registered for the draft, one of the first big leaguers to do it.”

it was important to us to feature the contributions of at least a few of the real-life code breakers, such as Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, and Dilly Knox.
Cambridge student named John Herivel, just twenty-one at the time, had the insight—while half-asleep in a chair—that careless Enigma operators might be giving away the machine’s ring settings. This was the inspiration for the breakthrough in Chapter 45 of our book.
By the end of the war, women made up seventy-five percent of the staff of Bletchley Park.

when he returned to the spot after the war, he was unable to find the treasure.
Finally, in the 1970s, the British government began allowing Bletchley veterans to tell their stories.
Many did, and these first-hand accounts were an invaluable source for this book. Some refused to talk; they’d vowed to keep the secret for life and did just that.
When we traveled to Britain in the spring of 2022, Dr. David Kenyon—the research historian at Bletchley Park—generously answered many questions and offered invaluable insights.

I prefer being straightforward. My older brother, Jakob, used to be straightforward. Before Willa disappeared,
Willa is our mother. Killed in a bomb blast, they told us.
Willa is the only parent Jakob and I have left. I made a pledge to uncover the truth about her disappearance. I told my brother as much in my correspondence. But Jakob hasn’t responded to any of the letters that I’ve sent to the curious address he provided.
“Very good, Elizabeth.” I exit the cabin. Turn the corner in the hallway. Pull a deep breath. And then I run.

London is bracing for war. I notice patches of yellow paint on all the letterboxes—those weren’t there before. The driver sees me looking. “That’s special paint,” he explains. “Meant to change color if it’s exposed to poison gas.”

And she insists on formality. Demands it. To Gran, I am Elizabeth, never Lizzie. “Nicknames such as ‘Lizzie’ are reserved for barmaids and axe murderers, of which you are neither,” she once said. Not yet, I should have replied. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Evading capture, being straightforward, running long distances, making friends—those are just a few of my talents. Keeping secrets? It’s not one of my talents.
And, wait, did I replace the floorboard? I’m not inclined to tell Jakob about the book I stuffed into my pocket. After all, if he has secrets, I can too.
He’s clearly memorized the handbook for horrible brothers. But no matter. My resolve is steadfast. I will hunt down the truth about Willa and thwart anyone who tries to stop me. Gran and Fleetwood included.
I’ve never seen the diary before. Is it something Willa used for work?
She finds it amusing. “This is not a game,” I whisper. “Just do what he says.”

He grips my arm in a viselike talon, marches me a few paces down the hall. “Listen, Novis, we’ve got some new arrivals, a couple of young mathematicians. You’ll get them up to speed.”
“You know the machine,” he says. “Yes.” “You know how it works.” I nod. That’s the easy part: how it works. “Well, show them,” the Colonel orders. “Like us, they’ll have signed their lives away.”

“Actually, if you don’t mind.” The man falls in beside me. “I need a word with you. About Willa Novis.” I stop. Stunned. “You see,” Jarvis says, “we’d very much like to know what happened to her.” “We? You mean . . .” “Yes, the Security Service,”
To the US embassy in Warsaw. Her task was to help the embassy pack up, get the staff safely out of town before Hitler invaded.” He looks up from his notes.
Should I tell him about that? How Willa showed up at my room at the Mutton, right before leaving for Poland?
Weeks later, I found something she’d left in my room. A newspaper clipping with recipes and tips for homemakers.
It wasn’t till about the tenth time I looked at the article that I found Mum’s coded message.

“Turing!” Nigel says. “I just saw him pushing his pram, with the shovel inside, and something else in there, something heavy, and it made the bottom of the pram droop way down, and he’s heading for Shenley Wood!
“Let’s see what Viola has to say.” I tear open the letter. Colin leans in close and we read together. Dear Lizzie, Imagine my surprise at receiving your letter and learning that you are still in England. My dear, war is upon us, and your mischief is most dangerous.
Tell Elizabeth this will not be tolerated. With God as my witness, my granddaughter will leave England.
Turing grabs the shovel and fills in the hole, stamping down the earth with his shoes. He kicks fallen leaves over the spot, then takes a small notebook from a jacket pocket and starts to write. “I bet he’s making a map,” Nigel whispers. It’s like something out of Treasure Island. I want to tell Nigel he’s got it all wrong. But how can I, after what we’ve just seen? Turing finishes writing. He puts the notebook back in his pocket, drops the shovel in the pram, and pushes it—with ease now—toward the road.

We looked everywhere for her.” I stand and begin to pace. “But to clarify—you did not witness her death,” I repeat.
And then I understand what Olivia is covertly suggesting. I sit back down and give her hand a squeeze. “This party. Yes. It will be the perfect setting for me to speak candidly with the ambassador and enlist his help. When and where is it?”
She’s sent her steward to take you

stand up. “I should get ready for work.” “Yes, by all means,” Jarvis says dismissively. I’m so sick of being bullied by this toothy scarecrow. I shouldn’t say it, but I do. “I have an important job, you know!”
I now have full appreciation of the phrase “run for your life.” I lead the mad dash to our flat, and as we round the corner it becomes very clear that despite his injury, Colin really should be considered for service.
“You didn’t see us!” I shout. Gibbs swiftly turns around, and we slip inside the building.
“That’s not what I mean,” he says. And then I understand. “Oh, Colin, you’re brilliant!” I turn in a slow circle, scanning the room. “Yes, I notice small changes. The sugar bowl on the table. That wasn’t there. Those two books that are off the shelf. The teacup next to the chair. I see it clear as day, now.” I turn and face Colin. “Someone has been in the flat.”
The changes are small, probably undetectable to most, until I get to Willa’s room. And then I gasp.
After a few long moments we hear the front door close. I reach for the doorknob. “Wait,” whispers Colin, grabbing my hand. “It could be a trap.”
“A rat in the American embassy. That’s big stuff.
The strings of odd lettering in Willa’s diary—what if they aren’t coded phrases, but actually words in Polish?”
“This woman. This . . . is Willa?” “Yes, why do you say it like that?” Colin looks at me, his face awash with shock. “Because I recognize her. I’ve seen her, Lizzie.”
“Willa came to visit you?” I sit up, wiping water from my forehead. “I was finally getting some sleep . . .” “Willa came to the Mutton?”
“Willa was here. She traveled all the way to Bletchley to tell you about her trip. She seemed different, worried. And you . . . you didn’t think to mention that to me?!”
I went to the American embassy to meet with Olivia McQuatters, one of Willa’s colleagues. She worked at the embassy in Warsaw. She was there when Willa arrived.” Jakob pauses near the window. “Wait, she saw Mum there, in Warsaw?”
“There’s something else I should tell you, Lizzie.”
As I move the thin newsprint over the bulb, tiny dots of light shine through the paper. Tiny holes—barely noticeable pinpricks—have

where Ambassador Kennedy waits. “We’ll go up to my office,”
“Do you have confirmation that Willa is dead?” I interrupt. He closes the door. “No. I do not have confirmation of that.” Hope surges within me. He knows something.
“He died in a horse accident, you know,” I say. Beryl looks over from her maths. She tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Who did?” “Arthur Scherbius, the inventor. Run over by a carriage in 1929. Didn’t live to see the German military buy his machine by the thousands.”
“I’m thinking,” John says. “Say that again, Novis.” “Which part?” “About changing the ring settings.
Very slowly, a smile forms on his face.
“Eggs and fish” to describe bombs and torpedoes. “Devil’s piano” to indicate a machine gun. And the phrase “gone for six” means that someone has died.

The ambassador’s voice appears. “Slippery little weasel. Where’d she go?”
Pounding and hollering: “Welchman! Professor Welchman! Wake up!”
John, Beryl, and I exchange glances. We’ve worked out the idea together—now we have to explain it.
“Here’s our Enigma operator. It’s midnight. Time to reset the machine for the day. He rearranges the rotors and looks up the day’s ring settings.”
“We need to know these settings—but we can’t know them. There’s nothing about them in the messages themselves. Or is there?”
“Let’s say the first rotor’s ring is supposed to be set to H. I turn the rotor until H is facing me. Then I slide the notch on the side of the rotor until it aligns with the H. I do the same for the next two rotors—say W for the second rotor and B for the third.” John does this. He closes the machine. The letters H-W-B show through the three tiny windows in the lid of the Enigma. “The machine is ready,” John says.
“Send this,” I order John. “Immediately!” “This is where human error creeps in,” Beryl says. “We know about cillies. But some operators might make a different mistake.” “It’s easy to imagine,” I explain. “The operator has to pick a starting position for the rotors. Three random letters. Suppose he simply uses the letters that happen to be showing in these little windows? H-W-B.”
“It’s so simple . . .” Welchman finally says. “Could they really be doing this?” “Most probably don’t,” I say, “but we don’t need most. If only a few operators make this mistake, we’ll know. We can watch for patterns as messages come in this morning.
If we see the starting positions beginning to cluster around any three letters, that’s probably not a coincidence.”
“For twenty-four hours we’d have the ring settings for the Luftwaffe’s entire Enigma network!”
Planes. The rumble and thunder of fighter engines overhead. Marion gasps and grabs my arm. And we run.
“Blast, Lizzie! You scared me near to death. I thought you were a German.” He quickly gets to his feet. “Did you hear the planes? They were ours—RAF Spitfires! Those Rolls-Royce engines are unmistakable.”
He had such a lovely accent and when he asked me where I was staying, the words ‘in Bletchley’ just popped right out.” Marion throws herself face down on the bed in distress. “I’ve jeopardized the whole operation!”
“Your father’s Polish dictionary. The coded message saying he would be proud. And then she organizes the trip to Poland. A dangerous trip.”
“Lizzie, don’t!” says Marion. “The Secrets Act!” “What’s the Secrets Act?” says Colin. Silence. Marion and I stare at him. “You haven’t signed it?” I ask.
“It’s another coded message from Willa. And it means . . . she’s alive.”
We’ve tracked the starting positions on every message that’s come since midnight, charting the results on a sheet on the wall in Hut 6. We’ve come up with
Between that and the usual cillies, we’ve got two big clues about how German operators have their Enigmas set up today.
There’s a shout from the direction of Hut 6.
Beryl grabs my arm. “I think it’s working!”
Welchman throws an arm around John’s shoulder. He looks at Beryl and me. “This will not be forgotten,” he says.
Operation Fleetwood. I think our plan feels sound.” “Yes, but it relies heavily on spirits. What if he’s cautious?” I say.
“Now read it backward!” Marion says. I read it again: “zygalskirozyckirejewski.” “Rejewski!”
policy, we’ve noticed, that no rotor can be in the same position in the machine for two days in a row. A smart idea, right? Wrong. It’s unforgivably bad. Moving the rotors makes them easier to find.
So there are 5 x 4 x 3 ways to arrange them: 60 total.
But if you change every rotor’s position every day, you can’t use 28 of the 60 possible combinations.
You see, this is why the world needs mathematicians!
When an operator sees German on her tape she shouts: “It’s coming out!”
In Hut 3, one team translates the German into English. Another analyzes the intelligence in each message: what it means, level of priority, who needs to see it. From there, everything is relayed by phone or courier to high-level military leaders in London and beyond. A box of choice product is prepared each day for Winston Churchill.
They’re creating a catalog of decrypted messages on index cards. The idea is to be able to search for any message by any subject: names of German generals, specific ports or airfields, types of planes or weapons.
“Operation Sea Lion?” I asked. Beryl nodded. “That’s their code name for the invasion of Britain.
Welchman laughs. “Maybe you didn’t need to bury that silver after all!” What? Did I hear that right?
“It’s safer this way. If the worst happens.”
Invested his life savings in silver ingots and buried them in some secret spot.”
“The thing is . . .” Nigel stands. He brushes off his knees. “I moved the silver.” “What!” “I had to, Jakob!
“Safe,” he says. “Hidden. Here in the Park.”
stop and turn to face him. “Do you know Willa, Mr. Jarvis?”
Have you heard from your mother, Miss Novis? Or perhaps seen her?” The hair on my neck stands at attention.
Something isn’t right. I have to ask myself, could it really be a coincidence that a letter arrived yesterday from Willa?
“Because a daughter keeps her mother alive in her heart,” I tell him.
“Wait,” says Jarvis. “She was here? When was that?” Oh. That was a huge misstep. He didn’t know. I try to recover.
“Many of the classic motivations of spies.” “That’s impossible. She hated Hitler.” “We’ve been over that,” Jarvis says. “You didn’t know her.”
I was hoping Nigel would be around. I could use at least one friend. And there he is. Up in his favorite tree. He’s looking right at me. But he doesn’t say anything. No—please tell me no. He’s watching me now?
“I’ve heard Turing mention him.” “Well, let me inform you of something. Willa was with them the day she disappeared.”
No code this time. Except, instead of a return address, it says ‘53.’ That means something.”
hat do you mean, pack my things?” I ask. “This is my room.” “I’ve made other arrangements.”
Stuck somewhere where it’ll be easier to tell if anyone comes to see me?” Jarvis nods.
“Safe travels, Lizzie,” I say. “Give my best to Gran. And get Feetwart home in one piece.”
It’s been reported that Colin’s brother was shot down over the Channel. He hasn’t been found.”
It’s not wonderful. Nothing is going to plan. Operation Fleetwood is failing.

That’s what the letters spelled. Goulash.
“My traveling clothes. My grief ensemble. A wonderful disguise.” “Disguise? Oh, Lizzie, no. You didn’t.” “Of course I did. Going to America was Marion’s greatest dream!

“It’s no use. We can see your leg,” says Colin.
“Your gran telephoned. A transatlantic call to the post office.
She will come to America, make her debut into society, be educated as a proper young lady, and make a favorable marriage match.
“Colin, you didn’t.” “I bally well did.

She says his spirit and health are broken, so he’s sequestered in some spa town—a place called French Lick, Indiana. He won’t be coming back for you.”
Male chauvinism at the Park continues to be problematic, and Reginald Ribchester, one of your guards at the front gate, is becoming all too chummy with Mr. Jarvis, a bully of an inspector with MI5.”
speak these things aloud, Colonel. The Secrets Act is most exhausting.”
“And from this point forward”—the Colonel leans forward and stares at me—“you will report only and directly . . . to me.”
“They worked on breaking German ciphers,” I tell Lizzie. “All through the 1930s.
“There’s a simple explanation,” Lizzie says, and I can almost see the bulb light up in her head. “Willa is a spy!”
“For the Americans, don’t you see?” Her eyes shine with pride.
“Slumgullion! That’s the word for American goulash.
please know that I’m terribly sorry that your brother is missing.
I’ve received a message that I don’t quite understand. It’s simply a word, but I don’t think the word itself is the message.” “Think of extensions beyond the word,” he says. “What does it symbolize, what could it represent, or what do you associate it with?

“Welchman knew of him too,” I say. “But . . . my father was a schoolteacher.” Dilly laughs. “That’s true. Let’s get some air.”
work we did during the First World War?” “A little. I know you were able to break some of the German codes.”
“My boy, we read everything,”
“Ezra Novis was one of the greats,” Dilly says. “Is that what you wanted to know?” “Not really,” I say. I wish I could think of a natural way to bring up the subject. I can’t, so I just jump in. “The three Polish mathematicians,” I say. “The ones who were working on Enigma before the war. I’ve heard Turing say you knew them.” Dilly stops. I expect him to ask me why I want to know.
with not much to show for it. That July, the Polish government extended a surprising invitation. They wanted a few British code breakers,
On the table were machines. They looked like typewriters but with rotors and bulbs that lit up. Knox and the others knew, in theory, what Enigma looked like. It looked like these machines.
Langer replied, “We made them ourselves.”
These were exact replicas of the German military Enigma.
The leading Polish code breakers—mathematicians called Jerzy Różycki, Henryk Zygalski, and Marian Rejewski—had been working on Enigma for nearly ten years.
they’d worked out Enigma’s internal wiring.
Even Turing’s machine is basically a more sophisticated version of their bomba.”
“The Yanks shut down their codebreaking bureau in 1929,”
“With his birthday.” “Right. And when is that?” “September seventh.” “Exactly. Tomorrow.
“A shared memory code! Give the code to the greatest genius, but if they don’t share the same memory or private information, they can’t possibly know what it means.
Colin. My stomach is jumbled and sometimes I even lose my words. And, Jakob—you know me—I never lose my words. It’s annoying.” “I believe that’s what’s called a ‘crush.’” A crush. Oh . . .
What if these jumbled letters represent, say, ‘today’s weather report’?”
It’s from Marion! On the reverse side, in teeny-tiny cursive, she writes: Dear Lizzie,
It’s a folded scrap, torn from a newspaper. Not a column from Mrs. Bardell. It’s a crossword puzzle.
Turing checks the connections on the bombe as he talks. “Said she was supposed to evacuate with other American embassy staffers, but the car left without her. She needed a way out of town.”
9 Across: Source of bilious complaint  I find 9 Across on the puzzle. Eleven letters.
“The lake was in Switzerland. She can’t expect us to go to Switzerland.” Lizzie shakes her head. “No. It must mean something else.”
53? How does that fit in?” “A room number? Time of day?”
“Look, Mum’s been sending us these clues,” I say. “It has to be her. But why? Doesn’t that frighten you? Is someone forcing her? What if it’s some kind of trap?”
It’ll be all right. Lizzie won’t dash off to some mysterious meeting. She can’t go, in any case. She doesn’t even know where it is.
53 Old Compton Street, London.
“I’m sorry. I thought it would be a quick trip. I knew you were busy.” Colin’s anger softens. “Busy? Are you that daft, Lizzie? I wanted to walk with you.”
“I like you, Lizzie Novis. I really like you. Is that straightforward enough?
“But, Colin, there’s something—” “Just promise you won’t leave. Not until it’s safe. We can go together then.”
I must go to London.
“Nothing?” he whispers. “You have nothing to say?” His eyes fill with hurt. “Fine. I see how it is.”
My shift is over. I hate to leave before hearing “It’s coming out!” But today is my father’s birthday. Goulash day. A massive German attack is coming. Our mum is out there somewhere. Expecting us.
Nigel shoves me toward the back of the van. It’s piled with pigeons in cages, cooing and hopping about. I look at him and smile.
Lizzie’s handwriting. I pull it down, tear it open. Swiss Hotel, 53 Old Compton Street, London.
“I’ll drive you.” “No.” He looks up from his work. “Colin, no. Your parents, with everything that’s
Addresses are obscured. Dozens of gray barrage balloons float overhead. Directional signs point to air raid shelters. I turn in a slow circle. The sky is blue, but the city is the color of war.
A prickle of apprehension skitters up the back of my neck.
But nothing about this feels right. It feels wrong. Entirely wrong. It feels . . . like a trap.
“It was nine, you’re sure?” I ask. “The crossword clue?”
“Nine across!” We turn round. Room 10 is almost directly across the hall from room 9.
It’s neat and clean-smelling, as if it belongs in a different building from the rest of the hotel.
The Colonel closes the door. He gestures to the two chairs positioned in the room. “Please. Have a seat.”
I was never here. You were never here. You will never mention anything we discuss. Is that understood?”
“I encouraged you to abandon the search for your mother. Your persistence is admirable, but I feared it might land you in danger.
“As you know, your mother traveled to Warsaw to assist with the dismantling of the US embassy before the invasion. But unknown to embassy employees, that was not her only goal. She tracked down three Polish mathematicians,
She infiltrated not only the group of Polish code breakers, but also their families.
“I suggest you brace yourselves. Your mother is not coming today.”
Your mother . . . is a spy.”
“A spy for us,” the Colonel says.
Her job was to help them escape the Germans. But there was an even more vital aspect to the task.” “To destroy evidence of the work the Poles had done,” I say.

Our work at the Park is built on the discoveries of the Poles.
“From this point forward, your response will be that your mother was killed in Poland.”
“Apologies, sir.” She shifts the tray to one arm and out of the corner of my eye, I see movement. She snatches my burlap sack. The door shuts abruptly. My mouth falls open. Jakob gives me a silencing glare.
“So, did you recognize her right away?” “Immediately. Didn’t you?” “Of course! And she was imitating Viola.” I clear my throat. “‘Here we are. Just the thing, tea.’ And did you see? She swiped my sack!”
“The Colonel,” whispers Jakob. “Do you think he knew?” “Absolutely not!” I breathe. “She needed whatever was in that calendar planner and she was going to get it. But even more so, she wanted to see us, Jakob. And she wanted us to see her.
Jakob. That is the greatest compliment.” I stand, grabbing her passport from the chair. “So, let’s go find her!”
“What’s this?” Lizzie asks, reaching in. She pulls out a piece of paper and unfolds it. A sheet of Swiss Hotel stationery. A short note, in Mum’s familiar handwriting:
“But she knows where to find us,” I say. “She’ll be in touch.” “The recipes . . .” Lizzie says, touching the words on the note.
Black planes, rows and rows of them, high above the city. Arranged in neat formations, almost like pieces on a game board. “Take cover!” the wardens yell. “Take cover at once!”
The Germans have arrived. Hitler’s wrath is descending.
“Dad,” Jakob says. “He was in it too, you know.” “In what?” He lowers his voice. “The same sort of work as me.
Lizzie and I walk around the car. Berrycloth’s precious motorcar. It must have been hit by falling wreckage. It’s dented all over. The headlights are smashed. The windshield is simply gone. “Not too bad,” Lizzie says. “Maybe he won’t notice.” Once again in a terrible moment, my sister makes me laugh.
Welchman cleared his throat. “Sea Lion postponed until spring.”
“Get ’em next year.” “Maybe not,” I say. “Hank Greenberg just registered for the draft, one of the first big leaguers to do it.”
It’s a quiet night at Bletchley Park. Until the German bomber finds us.
“Gran is full of energy. And also full of forgiveness. She righted your photos and displayed many of you and Jakob during your mother’s funeral. Nearly five hundred people attended, followed by a catered reception
And I’m so grateful to you for allowing me to come in your place.

“Bye for now, Marion.” The line clicks. I hang up the phone, filled with a quiet gladness. Friends are like family.
but I figure in a year they might let me work on Spitfires.
“Well, I’ve never had a crush either, but I imagine we’ll just be better friends now.”
Dad was a cryptanalyst. Mum is a spy. Jakob is a code breaker. I am an investigator.
it was important to us to feature the contributions of at least a few of the real-life code breakers, such as Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, and Dilly Knox.
Cambridge student named John Herivel, just twenty-one at the time, had the insight—while half-asleep in a chair—that careless Enigma operators might be giving away the machine’s ring settings. This was the inspiration for the breakthrough in Chapter 45 of our book.
By the end of the war, women made up seventy-five percent of the staff of Bletchley Park.

And it’s true that when the train carrying Polish code breakers and their Enigma equipment was bombed, teams loaded the priceless material into trucks and buried it somewhere along the border of Poland and Ukraine. As far as historians know, it has never been found.
things—yes, Alan Turing really did invest his savings in silver ingots, carry them in a baby carriage into the woods, and bury them near the village of Shenley.
when he returned to the spot after the war, he was unable to find the treasure.
Finally, in the 1970s, the British government began allowing Bletchley veterans to tell their stories.
Many did, and these first-hand accounts were an invaluable source for this book. Some refused to talk; they’d vowed to keep the secret for life and did just that.
When we traveled to Britain in the spring of 2022, Dr. David Kenyon—the research historian at Bletchley Park—generously answered many questions and offered invaluable insights.
