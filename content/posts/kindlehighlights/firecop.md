Avery was simply a guy who made a product others wanted, needed. Avery never sold to individuals.
“For us?” One of the ways Avery kept his costs down was to have many of the ingredients delivered to him by his close friends.
“Bull was a guy I knew who would get Sudo for us in exchange for free product.”
Eugene immediately regretted saying it. He

They asked him to continue working for them and gave Jesse a desk job in the office to help him, but did not think about helping by getting him PTSD counseling.
Jesse began self-medicating with alcohol.
Dude this reads loke a police report
Jesse was still at the kitchen table writing out the suicide note with his handgun sitting out when she walked in.
Larson was a trained negotiator and started trying to get Jesse to give up right away. Unfortunately when a man has decided he wants to die, there is little that can be said to change his mind.
People screw up suicides all the time, if he could save this man he was going in to do it. Ben started side-stepping, looking into the room carefully without exposing his body to anyone who might still be inside. Officers call this move slicing the pie.
“How many lives is Avery going to take before we do something about him?”
This was probably the first real lie he told to Stuart, but it was not about to be the last one.

If he were to respond over his portable, people would know he was not in his squad. “P27 to P32.”
Stuart Thompson and he would be talking someplace when the fire call came in, so he would have an alibi if somehow the worst happened. “Sure do. Feel free to name it.”

When the first hose line was pulled and there were three firefighters on the nozzle, they called for water. Risto pulled the lever to supply the water from the internal 1,500 gallon water tank to the pump.
It’s easy for a small fire to start in a basement and jump up to the second floor via a dumbwaiter, thus completely avoiding the main floor.
The nozzle man now kept his right arm rubbing on the wall to ensure they took the exact same way back the way they’d come. The

Officer Graystock heard the sound and knew it meant to get out of the building, as a collapse was likely.
The weight of the refrigerator broke what was left of the floor joist. With nothing to support the already compromised subfloor, the appliance and the cabinet next to it plunged into the basement.
inferno raging in the basement now had a direct opening to the main floor.
With the kitchen crew out safely, the water was now being sprayed through kitchen door.
Risto put a hand to his chest. He felt a very strong squeezing feeling, like someone was standing on his rib cage. The feeling made him a bit nauseated. Maybe it was dinner. I didn’t think it was too spicy,
The fire was now ventilated, meaning the heat had some place to go. Hot air rises.
The trapped heat had nurtured the flashover. Many fire departments actually attempt to cut holes in roofs or take out windows to ventilate fires.

Once it was out they would still need to do overhaul—the process of checking for hidden small fires or hot spots that could grow into a big fire after the fire department left.
the chief quickened his pace to a run when he spotted William Risto lying on the ground.
The two medics running to treat William were named Nate and Kim.
Ripping open William’s shirt, he looked up at Kim. “P-N-B.” These three simple letters let everyone in earshot know: pulseless, non-breathing. No heart beat and no breath; in clinical terms, dead.
“Please stop CPR and stay clear . . . analyzing rhythm.”
It wasn’t like on the TV, when the body jumps up. The reality is that the arms pull into the body, the back arches a small bit, tilting the head back more, the knees bend slightly. The shock was done and the muscles went limp again.
Not a healthy-looking rhythm, but, for now, it would have to do. “Keep up the breaths, let’s make sure he is getting lots of oxygen.”
They unconsciously paused to look at what was being done.

Because Stuart had been to evidence technician certification classes as a police officer and was on the fire department, he had been assigned the de-facto fire investigator.

P27 learned a long time ago never to point out there is no WE in YOU when talking to a supervisor. Stuart had no choice but to nod his head, thinking, Just shut up and agree.
The girl at the front desk had been nice enough to check the lost and found box to see if they had a charger for his phone. They had about a half dozen,

Ben figured he could follow the two and see where they went.
This system also had a good delay built in, so the arsonist could set the fire, but it would not break out for ten to fifteen minutes.
The police suspected him of about thirty fires, but when caught, he confessed to over three hundred.

These two tones were the signal being sent out to the firefighters’ pagers, telling the pagers to go off.
Stuart said, “Hello there, you are an interesting little pattern.”

Had Avery just admitted to killing TLP?
use that small shed for a short time. But I am serious here, only for a short time. You need to find someplace permanent as soon as you can. Okay?”
Even if he couldn’t discover Avery’s next location, Ben decided he would set at least one more fire.
Could he risk one more fire? The popular theory was that this was a drug war. Would one more fire perpetuate that theory?
This was it. Avery had a new lab set up. By the jars with chemicals in them, along with the smell, Ben thought a batch of meth was in process. Thinking back to Avery’s basement, Graystock knew he’d better not set this fire here, inside. He needed to set it outside the shed.
If the goal is to get the guy arreste why not poibt a fellow cop to this new location. Hey i heard yu were investigating this guy. Heard He now has a shed there. Go look.
Before his mind could register what that liquid could be, flames bounded up off the liquid.
Kevin realized this shed had no other door and there are no windows.

Ben poked his head inside the shed. “Coroner is here. Also, the homeowner and some other people are down the lane.
“I’m calling this one arson. Already found evidence to link this to two other fires, one of which was also a fatality.”
“He is the one who called 911, we think his brother was working in the barn that burned.
His brother Kevin was using my shed for some project. Kevin called Eugene about the fire. Eugene then called 911.
Reality set in for Ben. He’d just murdered a teenager.

The two men talked for a few minutes, like cops always do. Police work is a brotherhood, so even two officers who have never met could jump into a conversation just as easily as old friends could.
