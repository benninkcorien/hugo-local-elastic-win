Chapter 38
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
The back of Anna Downey’s white SUV peeked out of the water as Austin pulled up to the boat launch. He watched from fifty yards away, leaning on a chain link fence as a burly tow truck driver steadily reeled it in with an electric crank.
The rear windshield slowly came into full view. Austin held his breath, trying to find the serenity he found sitting alone in the little church. A cold wind blasted his cheek and he pulled up the collar of his jacket, waiting as the car slowly, slowly emerged from the water.
He didn’t pray anymore, but if he did he’d be praying that the car was empty. Praying that it didn’t contain the drowned bodies of Anna Downey or Joshua Green.
The ride from the hospital had been hell.
He’d spoken with Lucy, updated her about Jimmy, and learned that teams had now knocked on two-thirds of the doors in Hansville. In addition, volunteers had swept through Buck Lake Park and Point No Point, finding no one. Now the teams were walking the beaches, which were bordered by barnacled rocks, bluffs of varying heights, and logs the tide had half buried, integrated into abandoned driftwood forts built during the summer season.
He’d also learned that the search of Mary Bonner’s apartment was complete. They found reams of great material if the case ever went to trial—news clippings and printouts about Lorraine D’Antonia, more evidence that Bonner had been researching Johnson Hill Orphanage, even some photographs of the two women together as adults. Lucy had gone quiet for a moment before telling him about the most disturbing thing of all. Police executing the warrant had found a picture of Austin himself taped to Mary Bonner’s wall. That, along with a notebook police had found, indicated that Bonner blamed Austin for the incarceration of Lorraine D’Antonia. Mary Bonner knew Fiona’s name, knew Austin had moved to Hansville, even speculated that he’d moved to Hansville specifically to find her.
When they’d hung up, Austin began replaying every interaction with Lorraine D’Antonia in his mind. Every clue, every shred of evidence, every word of her confession. A lot more made sense about this case now, but it didn’t make him feel any better.
At some point, Mary Bonner and Lorraine D’Antonia had figured out they were sisters. Most likely, this happened when all the news about the orphanage began coming out. He assumed that one of them had heard about the orphanage, then began looking into the past, eventually discovering the other.
Maybe it had taken some time to form a bond—or maybe the twin bond ran so deep that they were close the instant they met. But close enough to commit murder for the other?
The only plausible explanation was that Mary Bonner had been watching D’Antonia’s case closely, only deciding to commit the first kidnapping when D’Antonia’s most recent appeal was denied. The appeal had been based on what D’Antonia referred to as her ‘false confession.’ Perhaps Bonner believed that if more babies began disappearing and dying in the exact manner used by the Holiday Baby Butcher, prosecutors would have to admit that D’Antonia’s confession had been false, that they’d jailed the wrong woman. She’d have to be a fool to think that’s how it worked, but Austin had learned never to underestimate the delusional power of motivated reasoning.
As the back end of the SUV emerged completely from the water, Austin passed through the gate that led to the boat launch. Ridley was managing the process, and he stopped the crew when the vehicle was high enough to get a clear view through the windows.
Austin stepped to within ten yards. Close enough to hear but not close enough to see. If they were in there, he didn’t want to see. He held his breath. His stomach tightened.
Ridley leaned in, then cocked his head back. “Empty!” He shouted.
A few cheers went up from a small crowd. At least Bonner hadn’t drowned Anna and Joshua.
But then the next fact sunk in. If she'd abandoned the car at the boat launch—or forced Anna to do it—she’d likely had access to a boat, which meant she may have escaped hours ago.
Austin hurried over to Ridley. “Any word on the missing boat?”
“No, but—” He stopped himself when a voice came through his radio.
“Detective Lucy here. We have the boat. Washed up on the shore at Twin Spits. Over.”
Ridley grabbed his radio and began walking toward his car. “I’ll be there in two minutes. Secure it from twenty yards. Don’t touch anything.”
Austin followed him to the car, but Ridley stopped on a dime. “Not you. Not this time. There could be heat.”
“Call me when you’ve searched the boat?”
Ridley nodded, then hopped in and sped away.
Austin shoved his hands in his pocket, mulling the thought that had popped into his head. Not a thought so much as an objection: he simply didn’t believe that Mary Bonner had stolen a boat. Maybe she was in good shape, but she was a small woman in her sixties, with two hostages. Plus, it was winter. Most boats were stashed away and winterized at this point. It was possible, but not likely. There was something he was missing, and he needed time to think.
Austin gave Anna’s dripping SUV one last glance, then walked back in the direction of his house.
