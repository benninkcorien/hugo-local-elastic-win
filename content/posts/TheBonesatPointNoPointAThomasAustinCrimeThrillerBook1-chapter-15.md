Chapter 14
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Before Austin could react, Trisha had taken off to the west. Her immediate reaction told him she’d been aware the police might show up, and she was faster than she looked.
Austin followed, fumbling for his cellphone. He had no gun, and no authority to use one even if he’d had one. But there was no way he was letting this woman out of his sight.
At a side street, she cut left, disappearing around a corner. Eyes darting between his phone and the sidewalk ahead of him, Austin pursued, catching a glimpse of her as he turned. He scrolled, looking for Lucy’s number, heart racing, feet pounding the pavement in a way they hadn’t in well over a year. He was still in pretty decent shape, though not as fit as he’d been in his thirties. And he’d never forgive himself if he got outrun by a frail-looking woman fifteen years his senior.
For a moment he thought he was gaining on her, but then realized she’d only slowed briefly to tug her sweatshirt back up as it slipped down her shoulder.
He called and Lucy picked up right away.
“Pursuing the suspect,” Austin shouted between heavy breaths. “Norman Road. Heading south toward…” He wasn’t sure. It looked like a park or a forest ahead of him. Then he saw the sign. “North Kitsap Heritage Park. I think she’s going to try to lose me there.”
Lucy said something he couldn’t make out, and he stuffed the phone in the back pocket of his jeans without ending the call.
Breathing hard, he pushed forward. She was only about fifty yards ahead of him now, but if she made it into the heavily-treed park, it might be enough to disappear.
Pumping his legs as fast as he could, he locked eyes on the back of her head, trying to reel it in like a giant salmon flapping against his fishing line out in the Sound. Forty yards. Then thirty. He was all focus now, determined not to lose sight of her.
She was only twenty yards away. There was no way she could keep up this pace. He just had to stay with her until she collapsed, or until Lucy found them.
Suddenly, she veered off the sidewalk, weaving into traffic and cutting between two cars as though she’d decided against the park, which was now close. Austin followed, crossing more slowly and following a little further back. Then, just as quickly, she reversed course, veering back to the original side of the street and glancing over her shoulder.
Austin’s eyes were dancing from the traffic to Trisha, from Trisha to the traffic, but they weren’t on the motor scooter shooting out of a driveway to his right.
Trisha hit the park, looking back and stumbling as her sweatshirt caught on a tree branch. She hit the ground face first.
Austin tried to leap the curb, but the scooter clipped him. His hip screamed in pain and he spun, crashing onto the sidewalk and smashing his shoulder. Looking up, he saw Trisha on her hands and knees, patting around on the ground as though searching for something. He stood and limped towards her.
She saw him, leapt up, and jogged deeper into the park, disappearing into a patch of trees.
He collapsed, the pain in his hip getting the better of him, and slammed an open palm onto the sidewalk.
The driver of the scooter, an acne-faced teenager, had stopped. “Mr., I’m so sorry. I was… you were. Oh no!”
“I’m okay,” Austin said, standing and brushing himself off. “Not your fault, kid.”
Then something struck him. What had she been looking for in the leaves?
Limping, he made his way over to the spot where she’d fallen. The ground was a mix of wet, decomposing leaves, and drier leaves that had fallen more recently. He prodded them with his foot, feeling for something. His toe hit something hard. He knelt.
There in the leaves—its glass screen cracked, its case filthy, was an iPhone.
When he tapped the home button, it lit up. He wouldn’t be able to break the password, but someone would.
He’d struck gold. He had their prime suspect’s cellphone.
