Unknown
EPILOGUERoger Bonney hasn’t been seen since that night. Only a few people understand what really happened to him. I spent a long time in conversation with Lieutenant Dolan and Cheney Phillips and, for once, I told the truth. Given the enormity of what I’d done, I felt I had to accept the responsibility. In the end, after much consideration, they decided no purpose would be served in pursuing the matter. They did go through the motions of a missing persons investigation, but nothing came of it. And so it rests.Now, in the dead of night, I ponder the part I played in Lorna Kepler’s story, in the laying to rest of those ghosts. Homicide calls up in us the primitive desire to strike a like blow, an impulse to inflict a pain commensurate with the pain we’ve been dealt. For the most part, we depend upon judicial process to settle our grievances. Perhaps we’ve even created the clumsy strictures of the courts to keep our savageries in check. The problem is that so often the law seems pale in its remedies, leaving us restless and unfulfilled in our craving for satisfaction. And then what?As for me, the question I’m left with is simple and haunting: Having strayed into the shadows, can I find my way back?Respectfully submitted,Kinsey Millhone
