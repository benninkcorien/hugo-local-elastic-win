EpilogueBY THE TIME I got back upstairs, the emergency room crew was already working on Jimmy Tate, who was whisked into surgery within the hour. The bullet had caught him in the abdomen and he’d apparently suffered a ruptured spleen. Bibianna wasn’t in much better shape, but both survived. Whether they lived happily ever after or not, I really couldn’t say, as all this happened just three weeks ago. I made it back to Santa Teresa in time for Vera’s wedding on Monday night, which was Halloween. Naturally, as I hadn’t had time to shop, I was forced to wear my faithful all-purpose dress, which in my opinion suited the occasion to a T. Vera was urging me to bring a date, so I took Luis with me, Donald and Daffy Duck arms and all.Raymond Maldonado has hired himself a top-notch attorney. At this point the charges against him range from murder one, in the case of Parnell Perkins, to grand theft, insurance fraud, mail fraud, all the way down to petty larceny. I gather that certain cases involving individuals with Tourette’s syndrome present a serious challenge to the criminal justice system. My guess is he’ll work out a deal, naming some of the other key figures in the fraud ring including three attorneys from the law firm of Gotlieb, Naples, Hurley, and Flushing.The cops never did come up with my black leather jacket. Somebody in the restaurant probably lifted it the minute my back was turned. I’m tellin’ you, people are crooks! And it’s not just the ordinary man in the street. I haven’t been paid for all the work I did. I billed the Santa Teresa Police Department for services rendered. Dolan tells me he forwarded the invoice to the LAPD, who’ll probably turn around and try to lay it off on the Department of Insurance. I’ll give those turkeys ninety days to “process” my money and then I’m calling my attorney.The only other matter that needs clearing up has to do with Gordon Titus and that’s simple enough. The sucker fired me.END.
