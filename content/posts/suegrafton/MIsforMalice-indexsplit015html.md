Unknown
FOURTEENOnce Jonah was gone, I found myself reluctant to return to the library. I could hear Christie and Tasha talking together companionably, their voices light, the conversation interspersed with nervous laughter. The subject had obviously changed. The ego is ill-prepared to deal with death for long. Even at a wake or a funeral, the topic tends to drift to safer ground whenever possible. I scanned the empty foyer, trying to get my bearings. Across from the library was the living room. I’d been in there, but I’d never seen the rest of the ground floor.I passed under the stairs to an intersecting corridor that branched off in both directions. I caught a glimpse of a powder room across the hall. I saw two doors on the right, but both were closed. Under the circumstances, I thought it unwise to snoop indiscriminately. In the unlikely event I encountered a cop, I was roaming in the guise of someone looking for the kitchen so I could offer my help.Before, the house had felt comfortable despite the touches of shabbiness that appeared throughout. Now I was acutely aware of the imprint of Guy’s murder.The very air seemed heavy, the gloom as languorous as a dense fog drifting through the rooms.I took a left, moving toward the unhappy scent of cooked cabbage at the end of the hall. In a sudden glimpse of the future, I could envision the day when this house would be sold to a private boys’ school and the smell of cruciform vegetables would overpower all else. Young lads in hard shoes would clatter through the halls between classes. The room where Guy had. been bludgeoned to death would be turned into a dormitory where adolescent boys would abuse themselves surreptitiously after lights out. Always, there would be rumors about the pale apparition gliding down the corridor, hovering on the landing at the turn of the stairs. I found myself walking quickly, anxious for human company.Beyond the dining room and butler’s pantry, the swinging door to the kitchen stood open. The room looked vast to me, but then my entire culinary kingdom would fit in the rear of a moderately priced station wagon. The floors were pale, glossy pegged oak planks stretching out in all directions. The custom cupboards were dark cherry and the counters were topped with mottled green marble. There were sufficient cookbooks, utensils, and small appliances in view to furnish one small section of a Williams-Sonoma retail outlet. The stove top looked bigger than the double bed in my loft and the refrigerator had clear doors with all the contents on view. To the right, there was the equivalent of a little sitting area; and beyond, there was a glassed-in porch that extended the entire length of the room. Here the lush scent of roast chicken and garlic overrode the odor of cooked cabbage. Why does someone else’s cooking always smell so much better than your own?Myrna had come back from the police station. She and Enid were standing together near one of the two kitchen sinks. Myrna’s face looked puffy and the prickle of red around her eyes suggested she’d been crying, not within the last few minutes, but perhaps earlier in the day. Enid had pulled on a poplin raincoat and the yards of tan fabric gave her the hapless form and shape of a baked potato. She’d removed her bandanna. Bareheaded, she had a wiry bird’s nest of hair that was dark strands streaked with gray. Tea mugs in hand, they must have been having a few last words about the murder because both looked up guiltily as I came in. Given their proximity to events, the two of them must have been privy to just about everything. Certainly, the family wasn’t shy about airing their conflicts. God knows they’d squabbled in front of me. Enid and Myrna must have picked up on plenty and probably compared notes.Enid said, “Can I help you?” She was using the same tone museum guards take when they think you’re about to reach out and touch something on the far side of the rope.“That’s what I came to ask,” I said. “Can I do anything to help?” Little Miss Goody Two-shoes working on a Girl Scout merit badge.“Thanks, but everything’s under control,” she said. She emptied her mug in the sink, opened the dishwasher, and set it in the top rack. “I better go while I can,” she murmured.Myrna said, “I can walk you out if you want.”“I’ll be fine,” Enid replied. “I can turn on the lights in back.” And then with a look at me, “Can I fix you a cup of tea? The water’s hot. I’m just on my way out, but it won’t take but a minute.”“I’d like that,” I said. I’m not that fond of tea, but I had hoped to prolong the contact.“I can do it,” Myrna said. “You go on.”“Are you sure?”“Absolutely. We’ll see you tomorrow.”Enid reached out and patted Myrna on the arm. “Well. Bye-bye. I want you to talk to my chiropractor about that bursitis and you call if you need me. I’ll be home all evening.” Enid took up a wide canvas tote and disappeared through the utility room, moving toward the backdoor.I watched Myrna plug in the electric tea kettle. She opened a cabinet nearby and took down a mug. Wincing, she reached for a canister and removed a tea bag that she placed in the mug. Meanwhile, outside, I could hear a car door slam shut and moments later, the sound of Enid starting her car.I moved over to the counter and perched on a wooden stool. “How’re you doing, Myrna? You look tired,” I said.“That’s my bursitis flaring up. It’s been bothering me for days,” she said.“The stress probably contributes.”Myrna pursed her lips. “That’s what my doctor says. I thought I’d seen everything. I’m used to death. In my job, I see a lot of it, but this...” She paused to shake her head.“It must have been hellish around here today. I could hardly believe it when Tasha told me,” I said.“You’ve worked for the Maleks, what... eight months?”“About that. Since last April. The family asked me to stay on after Mr. Malek died. Somebody had to take responsibility for running the house. Enid was tired of doing it and I didn’t mind. I’ve managed many a household, some of ’em a lot bigger than this.”“Couldn’t you be making a lot more money as a private-duty nurse?”She took down a sugar bowl and found a creamer that she filled from a carton of half-and-half in the refrigerator. “Well, yes, but I needed some relief from all the terminal illness. I become attached to my patients and where does that leave me when they pass? I was living like a gypsy, moving from job to job. Here I have a small apartment of my own and the duties are largely supervisory. I do light cooking occasionally on Enid’s nights off, but that’s about it. Of course, they complain. They’re hard to please sometimes, but I don’t let it bother me. In some ways, I’m used to it. The sick are often difficult and it doesn’t mean anything. I let it roll right off me.”“I take it you were here last night.”The tea kettle began a hoarse whisper that rapidly turned into a shriek. She paused to unplug it and the shrill sound subsided as though with relief. I waited while she filled the mug and brought it over to me. “Thanks.”I could see her hesitate, apparently debating with herself about her next comment. “Is something bothering you?” I asked.“I’m not sure what I’m allowed to say,” she hesitated. “The lieutenant asked us not to talk to the press...”“Not surprising,” I said. “Have you seen ’em out there?”“Like vultures,” she remarked. “When I came back from the station, they were all yelling and vying for my attention, pushing microphones in my direction. Made me want to pull my jacket right up over my face. I felt like one of those criminals you see on the television.”“It’s probably only going to get worse. This started out as a minor human-interest story. Now it’s big news.”“I’m afraid so,” she said. “But to answer your question, yes, I was here, but I didn’t hear anything. I’ve had trouble sleeping lately with this arm of mine. Ordinary analgesics don’t begin to touch the pain, so I’d taken a Tylenol with codeine and a prescription sleeping pill. I don’t do that often because I dislike the effect. Leaves me feeling logy the next morning, like I never quite wake up. Also, I find the sleep so deep it’s almost not restful. I went to bed about eight-thirty and didn’t stir till nearly nine this morning.”“Who discovered the body?”“I believe it was Christie.”“What time was this?”“Shortly after ten. I’d made myself a cup of coffee and I was back here in the kitchen, watching the morning news on that little TV set. I heard all the commotion. They were supposed to meet for breakfast to talk about the will, and when Guy didn’t come down, I guess Bennet got furious. He thought Guy was playing games, at least that’s what Christie told me later. Bennet sent her upstairs to fetch him. Next thing I knew they’d dialed 9-1-1, but I still wasn’t sure what was going on. I was just on my way out there when Donovan came in. He looked awful. He’d lost all his color and was white as a sheet.”“Did you see the body?”“I did, yes. He asked if I’d go up. He thought there might be something I could do, but of course there wasn’t. Guy must have been dead several hours by then.”“There’s no doubt?”“Oh, none. Absolutely. He was cold to the touch and his skin was waxen. His skull had been crushed and there was blood everywhere, most of it dried or congealed. Given his injuries, I’d say death must have been quick, if not instantaneous. Also, messy. I know the police have been puzzled by that aspect of the murder.”“Which aspect?”“What the killer did with his own clothes. Not to be gross about it, but there would have been quite an area of splatter. Blood and brain material. There’s no way you could leave the premises without attracting attention. The detectives were interested in a number of articles of clothing. They asked for my help since I take items to the cleaners.”“Did they find anything significant?”“I don’t know. I gave them everything that was going out today. They talked to Enid at length, but I’m not sure what they wanted with her.”“You have any idea what the weapon was?”“I wouldn’t hazard a guess. That’s not an area where I feel qualified to comment. There was nothing in the room, at least as far as I could see. I did hear one of the detectives say the autopsy was scheduled first thing tomorrow morning. I imagine the medical examiner will have an opinion,” she said. “Have you been hired by the family to investigate?”I could feel the lie form, but then thought better of it. I said, “Not yet. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. I can’t believe anybody in the family is going to turn out to be responsible.”I expected her to pipe up with protests and reassurances, but the quiet that followed was significant. I could sense a desire to confide, but I couldn’t imagine what. I let my gaze rest on hers with an expression I hoped appeared trustworthy and encouraging. I could, almost feel my head tilt like a dog trying to decipher the direction of a high-pitched whistle.She’d become aware of a dried speck on the counter, and she worked at it with her fingernail, not looking at me. “This is really none of my business. I had only respect for Mr. Malek...”“Absolutely.”“I wouldn’t want anyone to think badly of me, but I can’t help but hear things while I’m going about my business. I’m paid well and God knows, I enjoy the work. Or at least I did.”“I’m sure you’re only trying to help,” I said, wondering where she was going with this.“You know, Bennet never agreed to share the money. He wasn’t convinced that was Bader’s intention and neither was Jack. Of course, Jack sided with Bennet in just about everything.”“Well, maybe they weren’t convinced, but given the missing will, I don’t know what choice they had, short of court action. I gather nothing was settled.”“Not at all. If they’d settled their business, Guy would have gone home. He was miserable here. I could see it in his face.”“Well, that’s true. When I talked to him on Monday, he admitted he’d been drinking.”“Oh, especially last night. They started with cocktails and went through four or five bottles of wine with dinner. And then, port and liqueurs. It was still going on when I went off to bed. I helped Enid with the dishes and she could see how exhausted I was. Both of us heard them quarreling.”“Bennet and Guy quarreled?”She shook her head, lips moving.I cupped a hand to my ear. “Excuse me. I didn’t hear that.”She cleared her throat and raised her voice half a notch. “Jack. Guy and Jack quarreled before Jack went off to his country club. I told the lieutenant about it and now I’m wondering if I should have kept my mouth shut.”“The truth is the truth. If that’s what you heard, you had to tell the police.”“You don’t think he’ll be mad?” Her tone was anxious, her expression almost childlike in its apprehension.I suspected the entire family would have fits when they heard, but we all had an obligation to cooperate with the police investigation. “Maybe so, but you can’t worry about that. Guy was murdered last night. It’s not up to you to protect anyone.”She nodded mutely, but I could see she remained unconvinced.“Myrna, I mean this. Whatever happens, I don’t think you should feel responsible.”“But I didn’t have to volunteer the information. I like Jack. I can’t believe he’d hurt anyone.”“Listen, you think I’m not going to end up in the same position? The cops are going to talk to me, too. I have to go down there tomorrow and I’m going to end up doing exactly what you did.”“You are?”“Of course. I heard them quarrel the night I came here for drinks. Bennet and Donovan were going at it hammer and tongs. Christie was the one who told me they did it all the time. That doesn’t make ’em killers, but it’s not up to us to interpret the facts. You have to tell the cops what you heard. I’m sure Enid will back you up. Nobody’s going to be arrested on that basis anyway. It’s not like you saw Jack coming out of Guy’s room with a bloody two-by-four.”“Not at all. Of course not.” I could see some of the tension begin to leave her face. “I hope you’re right. I mean, I can see what you’re saying. The truth is the truth. All I heard was a quarrel. I never heard Jack threaten him.”“Exactly,” I said, with a glance at my watch. It was nearly six by then. “If you’re through for the night, I better let you go. I probably ought to get on out of here myself, but first I want to have a little chat with Christie.”Anxiety flickered in her eyes. “You won’t mention our conversation?”“Would you quit worrying? I won’t say a word and I don’t want you saying anything either.”“I appreciate that. I believe I would like to go wash my face.”I waited until Myrna had disappeared through the utility room, moving toward her apartment. My tea was untouched. I emptied my cup and left it in the sink. Despite Enid’s good example, I’ve never owned a dishwasher and don’t know the first thing about loading one. I pictured one false move and every dish would go flying, crashing in a heap of rubble. I returned to the library. Christie and Tasha had turned on the television set. Christie held the remote and she was switching from channel to channel to see if she could catch the news. She pressed the Mute button when I came in, turning to look at me. “Oh, there you are. Come in and join us. Tasha thought you were gone.”“I’m on my way,” I said. “I went out to the kitchen to see if I could help out there. Could I ask you a question before I take off? I heard you mention the mail when you were talking to Lieutenant Robb. Can I ask what that was?”“Sure. Uhm, let’s see. I guess late Monday afternoon someone put an unsigned letter in the mailbox. The envelope had Guy’s name on it, but there was no return address. He left it on the hall table when he went to bed last night. I thought the police might want to take a look.”“Was it typed or handwritten?”“The envelope was typed.”“Did you read the letter?”“Of course not, but I know it bothered Guy. He didn’t say what it was, but I gather it was something unpleasant.”“Did he ever mention a Max Outhwaite? Does the name mean anything to you?”“Not that I remember.” She turned to Tasha. “Does it ring a bell with you?”Tasha shook her head. “What’s the connection?”“That’s how the reporter first heard Guy was back. Someone named Max Outhwaite dropped off a letter at the Dispatch, but when Katzenbach checked it out, there was no one by that name and no such address. I double-checked as well and came up blank.”“Never heard of him,” Christie said. “Is there any chance he’s connected to one of Guy’s old sprees? Maybe Outhwaite was somebody Guy mistreated back then.”“Possible,” I said. “Do you mind if I check Bader’s file upstairs?”“What file?” Tasha asked.Christie answered before I did. “Bader kept a folder of newspaper clippings about Guy’s various arrests and his scrapes with the law. It goes back quite a way.”“I’ll tell you something else crossed my mind,” I said. “This Outhwaite, whoever he is, certainly put Jeff Katzenbach on the trail of Guy’s criminal history. I’m not sure Jeff would have known about it otherwise. The minute I saw the letter, I remember wondering if it was really Bennet or Jack who tipped him off somehow.”“Using Outhwaite’s name?”“It seems possible,” I said.“But why would either of them do that? What’s the point?”“That’s the problem. I don’t know. Anyway, I could be off base on this one,” I said. “I do like the idea that Outhwaite’s someone Guy sinned against in the old days.”“Take the file if you want. It was still on the desk in Bader’s office last I saw.”“Let me pop upstairs and grab it. I’ll be right back.”I moved out of the library and crossed the foyer. Maybe when I talked to Jonah, he’d level with me about the letter. I went up the steps two at a time, studiously avoiding a look down the hall. I had no idea which room Guy had been in, but I didn’t want to go near it. I took a hard left at the head of the stairs and went straight to Bader’s room, where I opened the door and flipped on the overhead light. Everything seemed to be in order. The room was cold and smelled slightly musty from disuse. The overhead illumination was dim and the pale colors in the room looked flat. I passed through to the office beyond, hitting switches as I went. Bader’s life force was being systematically erased. Closets had been emptied, all the personal items removed from his desktop.I surveyed the surrounding area. I spotted the folder with all the newspaper articles about Guy’s past behavior, relieved that the cops hadn’t swept through and taken it. On the other hand, the search warrant probably wasn’t that broad. The list of property to be seized might have been directed only toward the murder weapon itself. I leafed through the clippings, speedreading for content, looking for the name Outhwaite or anything close. There was nothing. I checked through some of the stray folders on the desk, but found nothing else that seemed relevant. One more dead end, though the idea was sound-someone with a grudge making Guy’s life difficult. I pressed the file under my arm and left the room, turning off the lights as I went.I pulled the door shut behind me, pausing in the hallway outside the master suite. Something felt wrong. My first urge was to scurry down the stairs toward the lighted rooms below, but I found myself slowing. I could hear a crackling sound and I peered to my left. The far end of the corridor was enveloped in shadow, except for an X of crime scene tape across three doorways. As I watched, the tape seemed to become nearly luminous, vibrating audibly as if rattled by wind. I thought for a moment the tape would break free, clicking and snapping as though a current were moving through it. The air on the landing was chilly and there was the faint scent of something animal-wet dog or old fur. For the first time, I allowed myself to experience the horror of Guy’s death.I began to descend, one hand on the railing, the other clutching the file. I pivoted, reluctant to turn my back on the darkness behind me. For a moment, I scrutinized the stretch of corridor I could see. Something hovered in my peripheral vision. I turned my head slowly, nearly moaning with fear. I could see sparkles of light, almost like dust motes materializing in the stillness. I felt a sudden flush of heat and I could hear ringing in my ears, a sound I associated with childhood fainting spells. My phobia about needles had often inspired such episodes. When I was young, I was often subjected to a typhoid inoculation, a tine test for tuberculosis, or a periodic tetanus injection. While the nurse took the time to pooh-pooh my fears, assuring me “big girls” didn’t put up the fuss I did, the ringing would begin, building to a high pitch and then silence. My vision would shrink, the light spiraling inward to a tiny point. The cold would rush up and the next thing I’d know, there’d be anxious faces bending over me and the sharp scent of smelling salts held under my nose.I leaned back against the wall. My mouth flooded with something that tasted like blood. I closed my eyes tightly, conscious of the thudding of my heart and the clamminess in my palms. While Guy Malek slept, someone had crept along this hallway in the darkness last night, toting a blunt object of sufficient brute matter to extinguish his life. Less than a day ago. Less than a night. Perhaps it had taken one blow, perhaps several. What troubled me was the notion of that first bone crushing crack as his skull shattered and collapsed. Poor Guy. I hoped he hadn’t wakened before the first blow fell. Better he slept on before the last sleep became final.The ringing in my ears went on, mounting in intensity like the howling of wind. I was weighted with dread. Occasionally in nightmares, I suffer from this effect-an overpowering urge to run without the ability to move. I struggled to make a sound. I would have sworn there was a presence, someone or something, that hovered and then passed. I tried to open my eyes, almost convinced I’d see Guy Malek’s killer passing down the stairs. My heartbeat accelerated to a life-threatening pitch, thrumming in my ears like the sound of running feet. I opened my eyes. The sound ceased abruptly. Nothing. No one. The ordinary noises of the house reasserted themselves. The scene before me was blank. Polished floor. Empty hall. Incandescent light from the chandelier. Glancing back down the corridor, I could see that the X’s of crime scene tape was simply tape again. I sank down on the stairs. The whole of the experience had surely taken less than a minute, but the rush of adrenaline had left my hands shaking.Finally, I roused myself from the step where I’d been sitting for God knows how long. From somewhere downstairs, I could hear a mix of male and female voices, and I knew without question that Donovan, Bennet, and Jack had returned from the police station, arriving while I was still in Bader’s office. Below me, the library door stood open. Tasha and Christie must have gone to join them. Faintly, from the direction of the kitchen, I could hear the clatter of ice cubes and the clink of bottles. Drink time again. Everybody in the house seemed to need alcohol along with extended psychiatric care.I completed my descent, anxious to avoid encountering the family. I returned to the library, peering in with caution, relieved to see the room empty. I grabbed up my handbag and shoved the file down in the outside pocket, then headed for the front door, heart still pounding. I pulled the door shut behind me, careful to soften the sound of the latch clicking into place. Somehow it seemed important to slip away undetected. After my experience on, the stairs-whatever it was-I was incapable of making superficial conversation. It didn’t seem unreasonable to suppose that someone in this household had murdered Guy Malek and I’d be damned if I’d make nice until I knew who it was.
