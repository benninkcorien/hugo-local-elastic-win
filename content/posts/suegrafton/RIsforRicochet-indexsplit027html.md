Chapter 26The drive from Santa Teresa to Reno took nine hours, including two potty stops and a fifteen-minute lunch break. The first seven hours got me as far as Sacramento, where Highway 80 intersects the 5 and be-gins its slow climb toward the Donner Summit, 7,240 feet above sea level. Smoke from a series of brush fires in the Tahoe National Forest had saturated the air with a pale brown haze that followed me across the Nevada state line. I reached the Reno city limits at suppertime and cruised through town just to get a feel for the place.Most of the buildings were two and three stories tall, dwarfed by the occasional chunky hotel. Aside from the casinos, businesses seemed to be devoted to making cash readily available. The working theme was cheap food and pawnshops, with the word “GUNS” writ large on two out of every seven signs.I chose an unprepossessing two-story motel in the heart of town, its prime attraction being that it sat on a lot adjacent to a McDonald’s. I checked ill, found my second-floor room, and put my duffel bag on the bed. Before I left again, I picked up the Reno phone book I found in my bed-table drawer. I went downstairs, left the phone book in my car, I and then proceeded to McDonald’s, where I sat in a window seat and treated myself to a couple of QPs with Cheese.According to the strip maps I’d picked up at the auto club, Carson City-the last known domicile of the erstwhile Robert Dietz-was only thirty miles away. Because of Cheney, I thought about Dietz without bitterness, but without much interest. While I munched fries doused in ketchup, I opened the Reno city map and looked for the street where Misty Raine was supposedly living these days. Wasn’t far away and I thought my next order of business was to pay a visit to the place.I dumped my trash and returned to my car. With the map propped against the steering wheel, I sketched out my course. The route took me through spartan neighborhoods of pines, chain-link fences, and ranch houses faced in stucco or brick. Even at seven in the evening, the light was good. The air was hot and dry and smelled of pine pitch and charred oak from the California fires. I knew the temperatures would drop as soon as the sun went down. The lawns I passed were parched, the grasses scorched to a soft yellow-brown. The trees, on the other hand, were surprisingly green, dense healthy foliage a relief in the relentless washed-out beige of the surrounding landscape. Maybe the whole of it was designed to keep all the gamblers indoors where gaudy colors dazzled the eye, the air temperature was constant, and lights were ablaze twenty-four hours a day.I spotted the house I was looking for-a one-story yellow wood-frame bungalow with three stingy windows across the front. The trim was brown and the door to the single-car garage was decorated with three vertical rows of triangles, yellow paint on brown. Shaggy evergreens marked the corners of the house, and the flower beds along the drive were filled with desiccated plant stalks. I parked on the far side of the street about four houses down with a clear view of the drive. When sitting surveillance, there’s always a concern that a neighbor will call the cops to complain about a suspicious vehicle parked out front. To create a diversion, I removed two orange plastic construction cones from the well of my car and then went around to the rear, where I opened the engine compartment. I set up the cones nearby, signaling engine trouble in case anyone got curious.I stood near the car and scanned the surrounding houses. I saw no one. I crossed the street to Misty’s front door and rang the bell. Three minutes passed and then I knocked. No response. I leaned my head against the door. Silence. I walked down the drive and scrutinized the padlocked garage, which was connected to the house by a short enclosed breezeway. Both garage windows were locked and the glass had been painted over. I headed around the front of the house. A wooden fence on the far side opened into a backyard that was depressingly bare. No sign of pets, no children’s toys, no lawn furniture, and no barbecue. The windows that overlooked the patio were dark. I cupped my hands to the glass and found myself staring at a home office equipped with the usual desk and swivel chair, a computer, phone, and copier. No sign of Misty or Reba. I was disappointed, having persuaded myself that Reba was staying with her. Now what?I returned to the car and settled in to wait, amusing myself by browsing the yellow pages of the borrowed phone book. Bored with that, I picked up the first one of three paperbacks I’d brought for this purpose. It was comforting that most of the nearby houses remained dark, suggestive of occupants at work. At 8:10, I saw a Ford Fairlane slow on approach and ease into Misty’s drive. In the fading daylight, primer paint on the driver’s side of the car glowed as though luminescent. A woman emerged, wearing a white halter, tight jeans, and high heels without hose. She reached into the backseat for two cumbersome plastic grocery bags, crossed to the front door, and let herself in. I could see interior lights go on as she moved through the house. This had to be the very Misty Raine that I was looking for.So far no one had questioned my presence on the block. I got out, retrieved the orange plastic cones, and returned them to my car-this by way of being prepared for whatever might come next. I resumed my reading with the help of a penlight I dug out of my bag. At intervals I glanced up, but the house remained quiet and nobody entered or left. At 9:40, prison-strength exterior spots came on, flooding the driveway with harsh white light. Misty emerged from the house, leaving lights on behind her as she got in her tank-size Ford and backed out of the drive. I waited fifteen seconds, fired up the VW, and followed.Once we reached the first intersection, there was sufficient traffic to provide cover, though I didn’t think she had any reason to suspect she was being tailed. She drove sedately, refraining from any abrupt or tricky moves that would indicate a concern about the thirteen-year-old pale blue VW traveling three car lengths behind.We proceeded into town. She took a right on East 4th and after half a block turned into a small city parking lot that sat between an Asian restaurant and a minimarket with a marquee that read: GROCERIES*BEER*SLOTS. I slowed and pulled over to the curb. I left the engine running while I spread out my Reno map and studied the layout. I don’t know why I went to such trouble to disguise my purposes. Misty didn’t seem to be aware of me and certainly no one else in Reno cared if I was lost. I watched her enter the minimarket and took advantage of her absence to pull into the same lot. I parked as close to the entrance as I could manage. Each space was numbered in paint, and a board posted on the brick wall of the market indicated that fees were paid on the honor system. Dutifully, I searched out the requisite window and inserted the number of dollar bills I thought would cover my stay. I was so engrossed in this display of municipal virtue that I didn’t spot Misty until she was halfway across the street, munching a candy bar. She had a carton of cigarettes under one arm.Her destination lay dead ahead, an adult-entertainment establishment called the Flesh Emporium. Under the double row of lightbulbs spelling out the name of the place, a blinking neon sign flashed: GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS... NUDE, LEWD, AND CRUDE. And in smaller letters: TATOOS AND PIERCING DONE WHILE YOU WAIT. And smaller still: BOOKS, VIDEOS, LIVE REVUES. The bouncer waved her in. I waited a decent interval and then crossed the street. There was a twenty-dollar cover charge that it grieved me to pay, but I ponied up the cash. I made a note to myself to add it to my expense account in a manner that didn’t suggest play-for-pay sex.Inside the entrance, a modest-size casino was hazy with cigarette smoke, the air aglow with the ambient light from a hundred slot machines lined up back-to-back. In passing, I picked up the soft, goofy flute-and-bell music that accompanies play. The acoustical-tile ceiling was low, dotted with can lights, cameras, smoke alarms, and sprinkler heads. Scarcely anyone was seated at the slots, but farther in, beyond the blackjack tables, I could see a darkened bar with a wide apron built along one side. On three hotly lighted platforms nude dancers undulated, strutted, and otherwise exhibited body parts. Nothing they did seemed particularly lewd or crude. I found a table toward the rear, feeling ill at ease. Most of the customers were men. All were drinking and most paid little or no attention to the breasts and buttocks on parade in front of them.There was no sign of Misty, but a waitress named Joy arrived at my table and placed a cocktail napkin in front of me. Sequined pasties the size of dinner mints chastely shielded her nipples from public scrutiny, and she wore a glittering fig leaf over what my aunt Gin would call her “privates.” I ordered a bottle of Bass ale, theorizing there was no way the management could water it down. When Joy returned with my beer and a basket of tinted yellow popcorn, I paid the fifteen-dollar tab and tipped her an extra five bucks. “I’m looking for Misty. Is she here?”“She just went to change. She’ll be out in a bit. You’re a friend of hers?”“Not quite, but close enough,” I said.“Give me your name and I’ll tell her you’re here.”“She won’t know me by name. A friend of a friend said I should look her up if I was ever passing through.”“What’s the friend’s name?”“Reba Lafferty.”“Lafferty. I’ll tell her.”I sipped my beer and picked at the cold, chewy popcorn, glad for the distraction as I didn’t really favor watching nude women shaking their booties at me even from a distance. I’d imagined voluptuous, showgirl-style bodies, but only one of the three had the requisite football-size knockers. I figured the other two were saving up.As it turned out, Misty hadn’t gone to change clothes so much as to strip off the garments she was wearing when she got to work. Her legs were bare and only a thong and her high heels remained. She was tall and lanky, with pitch-black hair, a prominent collarbone, and long, thin arms. By way of contrast, she had breasts of burdensome dimensions, the kind that give you back problems and require a bra with straps so fierce they create permanent tracks across your shoulder blades like ruts worn in rock. Not that I’ve ever suffered from such a fate, but I’ve heard women complain. I couldn’t imagine choosing to haul those things around. Her eyes were large and green with dark circles underneath that even heavy makeup couldn’t hide. I placed her f in her forties though I wasn’t sure quite where.“Joy says you’re a friend of Reba’s.”I didn’t know stripper-greeting etiquette, but I stood and shook her hand. “Kinsey Millhone. I’m from Santa Teresa.”“Same as Reba,” she remarked. “How’s she doing these days?”“I was hoping you’d tell me.”“Can’t help you there. I haven’t seen her in years. Are you in town on vacation or what’s the deal?”“I’m here looking for her.”One of Misty’s shoulders went up in what passed for a shrug. “Last I heard she s in prison. California Institution for Women.”“Not anymore. She was released on the twentieth of this month.”“No fooling. Well, good for her! I’ll have to drop her a line. The real world’s a shock when you’re not used to it,” she said. “Hope she makes it.”“The prospects of that are dim. She did well at first, but lately things haven’t been so hot.”“Sorry to hear that, but why come to me?”“Just a long shot,” I said.“Must have been awful long. I’ve worked here a week. I don’t get how you managed to track me down.”“Process of elimination. Reba told me you worked as an exotic dancer. With a name like yours, it wasn’t difficult.”“Get off it. You know how many strip joints there are in this town?”“Thirty-five. This is the thirteenth I’ve tried. Must be my lucky number. Can we chat?”“About what? I start work in two minutes. I need time to get centered. Gig like this is tough unless you have your head on straight.”“I won’t keep you long.”Gingerly she perched and I wondered if the wooden chair seat felt cold on her bare butt. The sensation couldn’t be that keen, but she didn’t yelp or otherwise vocalize dismay. She said, “Is this a fishing expedition or did you want something in particular?”“Why do you ask?”“I just thought if I heard from her, I could pass the message along-provided it’s not obscene.”“I’ve heard she’s in town. I’m hoping to talk her into coming back to California before she blows the terms of her parole.”“It’s no skin off my nose what she blows. Or who, for that matter.”“I understand you were cellmates.”“Six months or so. I got out before she did-obviously.”“She told me you kept in touch.”“Why not? She’s a nice kid and she’s fun to be around.”“When was the last time you heard from her?”Mock thought. “Must have been last Christmas. I sent her a card and she sent one back.” She glanced over her shoulder. “Sorry to cut this short, but that music is my cue.”“If she happens to get in touch, tell her I’m in Reno. We really need to talk.” I’d written the name of the motel, the telephone number, and my room number on a slip of paper that I handed her as she stood.She took the note, though she had no place to put it unless she stuck it up her bum. “So who’s paying you?”“Her dad.”“Nice job. Like a bounty hunter, huh.”“It’s more than a job. I’m a friend and I’m concerned about her welfare.”“I wouldn’t lose any sleep over it. One thing about Reba, she can take care of herself.”I watched her head for the bar. The matching moons of her ass scarcely wobbled as she walked, and I could see the muscles in her thighs flex and relax with every step she took. Bumping and grinding must be better than Jazzercise, plus she didn’t have to pay the weekly freight. I made a stop in the ladies’ room, where I availed myself of the facilities before returning to my car.Once there, I fired up the engine and sat with the windows rolled down, listening to the radio to pass the time. An hour later I began to worry about (1) running out of gas, or (2) asphyxiating myself with my own exhaust fumes. I cut the radio, killed the engine, and stared at the brick wall in front of me. This was the perfect screen on which to project recent memories of Cheney Phillips, probably not such a hot idea as he was many miles away.Unwittingly, I dozed. Lights from a passing car flashed across my windshield and I woke with a start. I looked to my right as Misty’s car passed behind me and slowed. She exited the parking lot and turned right. I started my car, backed out of the space with a quick chirp of tires, and pulled out shortly after she did. A glance at my watch showed it was 4:00 A.M. Apparently she did a six-hour shift instead of the usual eight put in by the ordinary working bloke. Then again, it was hard to imagine prancing around in high heels for more than a couple of hours at a stretch.I kept the Ford Fairlane in view, allowing as big a lead as I could give her without losing sight of her altogether. There were fewer cars on the road now and many of the storefronts were dark. The big casinos were still doing a lively business. Misty pulled up to the front entrance to the Silverado Hotel. The wide overhang that stretched across the eight-lane drive was so densely studded with lightbulbs that the air seemed to shimmer with artificial heat. Misty got out of the car and handed the keys to a valet. The big glass doors opened and closed automatically as she approached and disappeared inside.There were two vehicles in line between her car and mine. I leaped out and tossed my keys to an irritated-looking valet who’d been chatting with a pal. “Could you keep the car close? There’s a twenty in it for you. I shouldn’t be long.”Without waiting for a reply I trotted toward the front doors and entered the vast lobby, which was sparsely populated at that hour. I did a quick survey. There was no sign of Misty. She could have slipped into a waiting elevator, into the ladies’ room to my right, or into the casino dead ahead. Pick one, I thought. As I moved into the casino, smoke settled around me like a delicate mantilla. The silvery pings and grace notes from the slots were like a series of falling coins, the chirping of money as it trickled down the drain. Aisles ran in grids between the slot machines, the faces of which glowed bright red, green, yellow, and a saturated blue. I was struck by the patience of the few late-night players-like ants tending aphids on the underside of a leaf.As I walked, I was glancing right and left, looking for Misty, whose height and black hair would surely set her apart. Toward the rear there were restaurants. I could see a coffee shop, a sushi bar, a pizza parlor, and an “authentic” Italian bistro offering six kinds of pasta and a variety of sauces, complete with Caesar salad, for $2.99. I spotted Misty in the lounge, though my gaze slid right past her at first and touched on the man who sat across the table from her. He was red-haired and gaunt, his complexion ruddy and pitted with acne scars. Neither saw me. I eased into the lounge, which was open on two sides. I sat at the bar some distance away, watching as the two conferred. The bartender ambled over and I ordered a glass of Chardonnay. There were not many patrons present at that hour, and I worried I’d be conspicuous sitting alone.Out on the casino floor a great whooping and hollering went up, and shortly thereafter a party of five women came in, drunk and triumphant. One flourished a bucket of quarters, having won a five-hundred-dollar jackpot. My line of vision was obscured by their boisterous presence, but they provided me cover. I watched Misty engaged in a lengthy discussion with the man, leaning forward intently as the two examined something on the table in front of them. Finally, satisfied, she passed him a fat white number 10 envelope that I was betting contained a wad of cash. In exchange, he returned the item to a manila mailing pouch and handed it to her. I watched as she shoved it in her oversize purse. I tossed a five-dollar bill next to my empty glass and got up, leaving the bar in anticipation of her departure. I paused near the elevators, sliding a glance in her direction as she passed me and hurried toward the door. I followed in her wake.She gave the valet parker her ticket, and while she waited for her car, I angled left, keeping my head turned and my back to her. My car was parked near the entrance. I reclaimed my keys, tipped the valet, and slid under the wheel. Two minutes later, her car rolled into view and the valet hopped out. She handed him a tip and took his place under the wheel. I watched her exit the lot. I eased in behind her, this r time with only one car between. Once I was convinced she was on her way home, I took a left and sped along a parallel course. I arrived moments before she did. I killed my lights and slouched in my seat, eyes barely clearing the steering wheel. She turned into her drive as she had before, parked, crossed to her front door, and went in.The front light went out. I sat there for a minute, sorely tempted to return to my motel and crawl into bed. Surely she was in for the night, or what little was left of it. I was tired, I was bored, and I was hungry again. I pictured breakfast in a twenty-four-hour coffee shop: orange juice, bacon and scrambled eggs, buttered rye toast covered with strawberry jam. Then sleep. There had never been any guarantee that Reba was in Reno. I’d taken the chance because it made sense, given what I knew of her. The two of them had certainly been in touch-why else would her number show up on Nord Lafferty’s telephone bill? But that hardly spoke to the issue of her present whereabouts. I sat up, staring at Misty’s half-darkened house and the narrow line of light running along the bottom of her garage door.Why park in the driveway when she had a garage right there in front of her? In one of those unexpected jolts, I was clunked in the noggin by the obvious. If Misty were alone, she probably wouldn’t need two bulging bags of groceries or a carton of smokes. The groceries might have represented her weekly run, but the woman didn’t smoke. In the time we’d spent chatting, most smokers would have found an excuse to light up. It was actually that thin line of light at the bottom of the garage door that made me curious. I got out of the car and crossed the street.
