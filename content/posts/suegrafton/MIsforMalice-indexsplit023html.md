EPILOGUEPeter and Winnie Antle came down for Guy’s funeral service, which Peter conducted Monday afternoon. I thought the Maleks might object, but they seemed to think better of it. Tasha agreed to submit Guy’s holographic will for probate and eventually his portion of the estate will be passed on to jubilee Evangelical Church. I said nothing of Claire’s destruction of the second will. Guy deserved his fair share and I don’t think the family will make a fuss about his final wishes.Last night, Guy Malek came to me in a dream. I don’t remember now what the dream was about. It was a dream like any other, set in a landscape only half familiar, filled with events that didn’t quite make sense. I remember feeling such relief. He was alive and whole and so very like himself. Somehow in the dream, I knew he’d come to say good-bye. I’d never had a chance to tell him how much he’d meant to me. I hadn’t known him long, but some people simply affect us that way. Their sojourn is brief, but their influence is profound.I clung to him. He didn’t speak. He never said a word, but I knew he wanted me to let him go. He was far too polite to chide me for my reluctance. He didn’t hurry me along; but he let me know what he needed. In the dream, I remember weeping. I thought if I refused, he would be mine to keep. I thought he could be with me forever, but:! it doesn’t work that way. His time on earth was done; He had other places to go.In the end, I set him free, not in sorrow, but in love. It wasn’t for me. It was something I did for him. When I woke, I knew that he was truly gone. The tears I wept for him then were the same tears I’d wept for everyone I’d ever loved. My parents, my aunt. I had never said good-bye to them, either, but it was time to take care of it. I said a prayer for the dead, opening the door so all the ghosts could move on. I gathered them up like the petals of a flower and released them to the wind. What’s done is done. What is written is written. Their work is finished. Ours is yet to do.
