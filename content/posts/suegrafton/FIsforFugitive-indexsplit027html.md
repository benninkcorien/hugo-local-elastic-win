Unknown
EpilogueThe case against Bailey Fowler has been dismissed. He turned himself in when he heard news of Ann’s arrest. She was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Ori Fowler and Shana Timberlake. The DA’s office may never be able to assemble sufficient evidence to prosecute her for the death of Jean Timberlake.Two weeks have passed. I’m now back in my office in Santa Teresa, where I’ve itemized expenses. With the hours I put in, my mileage, and meals, I’m billing Royce Fowler for $1,832 against the two grand he advanced. We chatted about it by phone and he’s told me to keep the change. He’s still hanging on to life with all the stubbornness he can muster and at least Bailey will be with him during his last weeks.I find that I’m looking at Henry Pitts differently these days. He may be the closest thing to a father I’ll ever have. Instead of viewing him with suspicion, I think I’ll enjoy him for the time we have left, whatever that may be. He’s only eighty-two, and God knows, my life is more hazardous than his.- Respectfully submitted, Kinsey Millhone
