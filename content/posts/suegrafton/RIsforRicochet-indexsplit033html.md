EPILOGUEThat wasn’t the end of it, of course. Beck was indicted on charges of murder, assault with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, money laundering, income tax evasion, conspiracy to defraud the United States government, tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, failure to report currency transactions, and corruption of public officials. At first, Beck was undismayed. After all, he knew he had enough money stashed away to support an army of attorneys for as long as it took. There was just that one small matter Reba had neglected to mention. This was something I guessed at, but couldn’t persuade her to confirm. Before she swapped the two computers, she’d tapped into Beck’s accounts, consolidated all his funds, and moved the money out of the country, probably to another of Salustio’s numbered accounts. I’m sure she’d thought of some way to repay him for holding the money until she could lay claim to it.The feds suspected this as well because the cranky little shits refused to cut her a deal. Reba was returned to CIW on the first sheriffs bus. I don’t worry about her. In prison, she has good friends, she’s fond of the staff, and she knows her only choice is to behave herself. In the meantime, her father’s doing fine. He’s not going to die as long as Reba needs him.As for Cheney and me, that’s still up in the air, but I’m feeling the teeny-tiniest bit optimistic. I’m about due, don’t you think?So here’s what I’ve learned. In the passing drama of life, I’m usually the heroine, but occasionally I’m simply a minor character in someone else’s play.Respectfully submitted,Kinsey Millhone
