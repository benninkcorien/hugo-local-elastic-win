EpilogueWhen the cops finally tore up the area around Bronfen’s potting shed, four bodies came to light. The one buried in the footing was tagged as a former resident of the board-and-care, whose pension checks Bronfen had been cashing for a good five months. The pathologists are still working to identify the remaining dead, but one is most assuredly Bronfen’s wife, Sheila. Irene is doing better now that she knows the truth. She’s found a good therapist who’s helping her sort it all out. It may take her years yet, but at least she’s on the right path.A third (and final) hired assassin was apprehended in Carson City shortly after Messinger was killed. Yesterday, I spoke to Lee Galishoff, who told me Tyrone Patty died of a knife wound, the result of a dispute with an inmate half his size.As for Dietz, he was with me until August 29 when the job he was hoping for materialized. He’s in Germany now, filming mock infiltrations of military bases.He swears he’s coming back. I’d like to believe him, but I’m not sure I dare. In the meantime, I have work of my own to do and a life that feels richer for his having been a part of it.Respectfully submitted,Kinsey Millhone
