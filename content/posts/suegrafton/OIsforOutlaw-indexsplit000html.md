“O” is for OUTLAWThe Kinsey Millhone MysteriesSue GraftonThe call comes on a Monday morning from a guy who scavenges defaulted storage units at auction. The weekend before, he’d bought a stack of cardboard boxes. In one, there was a collection of childhood memorabilia with Kinsey’s name all over it. For thirty bucks, he was offering Kinsey the lot.Though she’s never been one for personal possessions, curiosity is a powerful force. She agrees to meet the guy, then hands over a twenty (she may be curious, but she’s also cheap and she loves a bargain).What she finds among the items is an old undelivered letter to her that will force her to reexamine her beliefs about the breakup of her first marriage... about the honor of her first husband... and about an old unsolved murder.It will put her life in the gravest peril.“O” Is for Outlaw: Kinsey’s fifteenth excursion into the dark side of human nature.
