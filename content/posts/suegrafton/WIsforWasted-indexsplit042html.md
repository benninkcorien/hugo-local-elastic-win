W Is for Wasted
 AUTHOR’S NOTEA few words about the basic underpinnings of this novel:Addiction medicine and scientific fraud are both complex issues, and I lay no claim to a comprehensive understanding of the two fields. It’s my hope that in folding pharmacological research and crime into the same mix, I do no great disservice to either. For errors, witting and unwitting, I offer my apologies. Insofar as I manage to represent these matters with any accuracy, I am indebted to the following:Angell, Marcia, M.D. The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It.
