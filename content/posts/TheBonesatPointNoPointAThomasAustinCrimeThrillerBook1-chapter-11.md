Chapter 10
CHAPTER TEN
“Tell me about the first victims, the Shreever family,” Austin said. “Did you interview the parents?”
“Ridley led the interview,” Lucy said, flicking on the windshield wipers, “but I was there. He and I are partners, normally.”
They were halfway across the Agate Pass Bridge, an old steel truss bridge that had replaced a ferry service that had run people from the Kitsap Peninsula to Bainbridge Island from the 1920s into the 1950s. Despite the light drizzle, the views to the southeast were stunning: blue-gray water, evergreen western hemlocks and Douglas firs dotting the misty shores. The area was an endless maze of inlets, bays, pebbly beaches, and view after view that looked like it belonged on a postcard.
“How hard did you look at the Shreever family?” Austin asked. Every detective shared the first instinct when it came to both kidnapping and murder: work from the inside out. The inside was the circle closest to the victim: spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, close family members, extended family, friends, and work acquaintances. Though most people feared random attacks and senseless home invasions, the truth was that most violent crimes were perpetrated by people already known to the victim.
“We were all over them,” Lucy said. “Regular Bremerton family. Pretty well off. Mom was a JAG lawyer. Navy. Dad wasn’t Navy, but he worked in the shipyard.”
“What role?”
“Contractor. Well, he works for one. Painting, repairs, that kind of thing. My read on them was a negative right away, but we worked it pretty hard. Before the bones were found, we were treating it like a regular kidnapping, as if any kidnapping can be considered ‘regular.’”
“Their marriage?”
“Shockingly good. They’d just had their fifth wedding anniversary, dozens of people came. Years of Facebook posts about each other. Kind of couple that posts gushy appreciation stuff about each other every day. Kinda gross, but also kinda sweet, depending on how sentimental I’m feeling.”
“Staged, maybe?”
Lucy shook her head. “They handed over their cellphones within ten minutes. No arguments to speak of. Doctors and nurses in the hospital said he was supportive, caring. I’m cynical as hell, and even I ended up jealous about their marriage. I’d kill for a man like that.”
Austin looked over. “What about Jimmy?”
She scoffed. “No.”
Austin waited for her to look over, then raised an eyebrow. “Seemed like—”
“Also no.”
Austin smiled. “Touchy subject, huh?”
“We had a thing for about a month when he first started. He’s five years younger than me. Ridley told me I should break it off if I want to be his boss one day.”
“Do you want to be his boss one day?”
“Ridley should be Sheriff. He’s five times the man Daniels is. When he’s Sheriff, I could get lead detective.” She smiled awkwardly. “Eventually.”
Austin wanted to dig deeper, a welcome distraction from thoughts about whether a seemingly happy couple would stage the kidnapping and murder of their own baby. It wasn’t likely, but Ridley and his team had already looked at all the likely options. He’d been brought in to consider the unlikely ones.
His first thought had been that something could be wrong with the Shreever marriage, something that didn’t show up in texts and Facebook posts. Maybe the father wanted out and didn’t want the kid, so he staged it to look like a copycat serial killer. It was a stretch, though not impossible. Or maybe the couple had learned that Allie had a rare disease after she was born and didn’t want to deal with it. As sick as that was, he’d seen it on more than one occasion. “So, in your mind, there is zero chance the Shreevers were involved?”
“Zero, and now with this new case—”
“Serial killers and serial kidnappers are a hell of a lot rarer than moms and dads who feel they have no other choice, moms and dads with drug and alcohol problems, moms and dads who accidentally kill their child, then try to cover it up.”
Lucy gave him a frustrated glare. “I know that, New York, I didn’t get my badge two weeks ago. All I’m saying is that two kidnappings this close together, with such similarities, and combined with the bones, makes me think we’re not gonna find out a family member is behind this.”
“Sorry, I wasn’t trying to… just trying to go back to the beginning.”
“Nah, I’m sorry. It’s why Ridley brought you in.” Her hands gripped the steering wheel tighter as she turned off the main road onto a winding side street heading east. “This one is really getting to me. I’m frustrated. I don’t know if I can live through another meeting with a family where I show them a bag of their baby’s bones.”
“You have kids?” Austin asked.
“Nah, you?”
“No.”
They rode in silence, the only sound the occasional splash of rainwater falling on the roof of the car after collecting in the branches of the evergreens that shrouded the road.
“I understand about the parents,” Austin said. The horrors of this job were bad enough. Explaining them to innocent family members was worse. “Let’s not let that happen.”
Detective Calvin had mentioned that a woman had been spotted on the beach where the bones were found. That’s where Austin’s mind went next. “Anything on the woman who we believe left the bones?”
“Just the crappy sketch you saw.”
“I assume you ran the sketch by the Shreever family to see if they recognized her? Family member? Nanny? Housekeeper?”
“We did. Nothing. After this interview, we’ll talk to the witnesses. They’ve been helpful—or tried to be. Little hooligans never should have talked to a reporter, but… Well, all we have is a woman between fifty and seventy, light brown or dirty blonde hair. Kinda hard to tie that to the Shreever family, though we did comb through all their social media. Don’t have a housekeeper or nanny. One aunt fit the description, but we placed her in Connecticut at the time. She’s Navy, too. Airtight alibi.”
Austin saw a TV news van parked at the end of the block, then the police tape surrounding the house. Lucy parked and led Austin into the yard, where Detective Calvin was taking questions from a gaggle of reporters that included one serious-looking Asian man with a Seattle Times badge, a couple younger reporters who looked like bloggers, and Anna Downey.
“We’re not ruling anything out at this time,” Ridley was saying when they stopped next to him.
The reporter from the Seattle Times followed up. “Would you say the similarities between this case and the Shreever kidnapping and murder concern you?”
“Everything concerns me,” Ridley said, voice calm and direct. “And, like I said, though we do not have evidence the cases are connected, we are certainly looking at that angle.”
Movement caught Austin’s eye and he turned to the side of the house, where a large peacock was prancing toward them. It strolled across the lawn like it owned the place, watched the reporters for a moment, then let out a long, shrill noise, halfway between a cat’s meow and a baby’s cry. Austin leaned over to Lucy. “That normal here?”
“Normal?” she whispered. “No. Unheard of? Also no.”
The peacock proceeded to walk up to the crowd and spread its magnificent, shimmering tail, which spanned four or five feet and was covered in giant spots. Then it began to rustle and rattle its tail feathers, a sound almost like a drumroll.
“What the hell is happening?” Austin asked no one in particular.
Anna crouched down to get a closer look. “This is a male, he’s looking for a mate. You interested?”
Austin frowned at her.
“Bird people call that noise the ‘love rattle,’” Anna continued. “Vibrations can be felt in the tail of a female peacock.”
Austin shook his head. “Learn something new every day.”
As the peacock wandered away, Ridley declined to answer any more questions, then led Austin and Lucy into the residence.
Deidre Gailhammer and Damian Green sat on opposite ends of a beige leather couch. The space between them was only a single couch cushion, but it felt much, much larger. As Detective Calvin introduced Austin and Lucy, Austin studied them. Sometimes tragedy brought couples closer together. This was not one of those times.
There was a frostiness there, an anger. They wouldn’t look at each other. Deidre’s round face, freckled like Lucy’s, was red and blotchy, possibly from hours of crying but possibly from drinking. Most likely, both. She passed an empty coffee cup nervously from hand to hand. Damian sat stone-faced, emotionless. To some detectives Austin had worked with, this was a red flag. If your baby son was taken from your house, wouldn’t you be upset? But Austin had learned that victims respond to tragedy differently, and it was a mistake to leap to judgment too quickly. Still, it made him wonder.
When he’d woken up in the hospital after twelve hours of emergency surgery, numb from painkillers and desperate for news about his wife, he’d been similarly emotionless. When his captain had arrived to tell him Fiona was gone, he’d felt as though his heart had been hacked to bits with a rusty hatchet. He’d wished the gunmen had taken him, too. But he hadn’t said any of that to his captain. Instead, he’d bitten his lip until it bled, trying to hold everything in. Then he’d proceeded to tell his commanding officer every single detail he could remember about the attackers. Only later, alone in the hospital bed in the middle of the night, had he allowed the emotions to come.
He knew what it was like to try to stay rational, stay sane, when everything was falling apart. So his first read on the father was that he was doing just that, staying calm so he could communicate with the detectives.
Then Damian Green glanced at his wife, stood slowly, and lunged at Detective Calvin like a drunk in a bar fight.
