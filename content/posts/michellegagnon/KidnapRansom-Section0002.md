JANUARY 29
Three
Kelly Jones relaxed. The water surrounding her was warm, womblike. She let herself drift as images flashed across her mind’s eye. Agent Leonard barking a command as he ran alongside her, before vanishing in a flash of light and heat. Her former partner, Rodriguez, laughing at his own jokes. Her family, all together again, making pancakes. And finally Jake Riley, the man she had promised to marry. She was focusing on his easy grin, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled, when a voice jolted her back to the present.
“That’s not bad. Now raise and lower it one more time.”
Kelly opened her eyes. She was floating on her back. The ceiling above the pool danced with the shadows of ripples. From this distance it almost appeared alive, like some great writhing beast. She gritted her teeth and tried to do what she was told, focusing on her right leg, forcing it to resist the hand pressing against her quad. A bead of sweat rolled down her forehead and into the water.
“Not bad. But try to raise it all the way up.”
“It’d be a hell of a lot easier if you stopped pushing it down,” Kelly muttered, teeth clenched.
“Sure would, but that’s not my job. Remember our goal?”
Kelly had disliked the physical therapist on sight, and her chirpy voice with the irritating habit of emphasizing every other word had only become more grating over time. Still, she was supposed to be the best in her field. And to get back on active duty, Kelly would tolerate almost anything. Even a she-devil named Brandi.
“One more time and we’re done.”
“That’s what you said before the last one,” Kelly protested.
Brandi shrugged. “I lied. C’mon, you can do it!”
Kelly closed her eyes again. She strained hard, clenching her leg muscles and gluts. There was a splash: her stump had broken the surface of the water. She let her head drop back down, still unaccustomed to the sight of it. “’s what I’m talking about!” Brandi exclaimed, clapping her hands together. “All right, now you’re done. See you on Thursday.”
“I thought we could meet tomorrow instead,” Kelly said. She hated the pleading tone in her voice, but she needed this. The more PT she did, the faster she’d be able to get back to work. Seven months off and she was climbing the walls. At this point it felt like another few weeks would kill her. And the only person who could clear her for active duty was standing in front of her, ponytail pointing straight up like an exclamation point, glossy pink lips pressed firmly together.
“Now, Kelly.” Brandi shook her head disapprovingly. “Remember our chat about recovery time?”
“I’m never sore the next day anymore,” Kelly protested.
Brandi’s expression didn’t soften. “No way, missy. I will see you on Thursday.” She leaned in. “But if you like, I’ll sneak in an extra half hour.”
“Gee, thanks.” Kelly resisted the urge to roll her eyes. She watched Brandi swim fluidly over to the ladder. The pool wasn’t kept locked, she reasoned. There was nothing to keep her from sneaking in tomorrow to do the exercises herself.
As if reading her thoughts, Brandi called back over her shoulder, “And don’t even think about coming in here alone. I’ll have Ray at the front desk buzz me if you do.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Kelly sighed.
“Sure you wouldn’t. See ya!”
Kelly watched Brandi bounce toward the locker room. What she’d give for her sidearm at a time like this. Not that she’d actually shoot the girl, but the thought of scaring the smug grin off her face was tempting. Of course, then Kelly could definitely kiss her job goodbye.
With a deep sigh Kelly dived, kicking hard with her good leg and digging her right arm in deep with each stroke to keep moving in a straight line. Reaching the side of the pool she gripped the ledge hard, using her triceps to haul herself out of the water. Her upper body was strong, more defined than it had been before the accident, thanks to months in a wheelchair. She flipped herself around so that she was sitting, then drew her left leg out of the water and used it to push herself back. Kelly kept her eyes averted as she reached for a towel.
Thanks to a grenade explosion, her right leg now ended just below the knee. It happened on her last case, back in July. Kelly had been chasing a skinhead who was determined to blow up a dirty bomb at the U.S./Mexico border. They’d managed to stop him, but at the last minute he pulled the trigger on a grenade. Four FBI agents had been killed instantly, including Agent Leonard. Another agent had suffered serious injuries, but pulled through. He was back on active duty already. Sometimes it was hard for Kelly not to resent him.
She’d been running away from the truck when the explosion occurred, which probably saved her life. Unfortunately a chunk of metal landed on her leg, crushing it, and she’d sustained internal injuries. The doctor claimed she was lucky to have come out of the coma, plus they’d been able to save most of her leg. Kelly d herself off, then snapped on her prosthetic. Without the skin-toned polyurethane foam cover, the carbon fiber pylon that substituted for her lower leg made her look like a cyborg. Lucky was not the first word that came to mind.
As Kelly made her way to the locker room, fighting the limp that took over when her muscles were tired, she focused on the floor, avoiding the eyes of everyone she passed. Everywhere but here she was able to keep the damage out of sight. She’d thrown away every skirt, dress, and pair of shorts she owned. She even wore sweatpants to bed now, removing the prosthetic under the covers when the lights were off.
She flashed back on Jake. He’d been the portrait of compassion, staying by her bedside during the entire healing process, then having his apartment reconfigured to suit her new needs. He’d even offered to support her financially if the FBI refused to put her back in the field. The problem was, he’d become such a good nursemaid that sometimes it seemed like that was all they were anymore, and she hated feeling like a patient. Occasionally Kelly caught him looking at her with pity, but when she confronted him, he always protested that his feelings for her hadn’t changed.
And yet, he’d barely touched her since the accident. Not that she blamed him. If she couldn’t stand looking at herself, how could she expect anyone else to feel differently?
In the locker room Kelly dressed quickly. The showers here were public, so she always waited to wash off at home. She tugged a scarf around her neck as she pushed through the door to the street, instantly swept up by the mass of people swarming Fifth Avenue. The physical therapy center was located on a tiny block in Midtown, across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Christmas had come and gone, holiday cheer vanishing along with the fancy window displays. After a week of steady sleet the streets were a mess, puddles of filthy, freezing brown water pooled along the curbs. Everyone pushing past Kelly looked as miserable as she felt, shoulders hunched against the cold, bundled up so that only their eyes were visible. Because of that, it took a minute to recognize the woman grabbing her elbow.
“Kelly? God, I can’t believe it’s you!”
“Monica?” For a second Kelly experienced one of those surreal moments where she thought she might be dreaming. She’d worked a case with Monica Lauer the summer before last, a nasty one where dueling serial killers squared off in the Berkshires. She hadn’t seen her since. “What are you doing here?”
“I should ask you the same thing. Wait, don’t tell me. You married that gorgeous man of yours and live here now.”
“Kind of. Well, no, not married, but…we’re living together. And engaged.”
“Well, good for you.” Monica pulled off a glove and waved her left hand at Kelly. “Just took the plunge myself. Howie and me meet up here, since it’s about halfway between Bennington and D.C.”
“You married Howie?” Kelly said. The brash lieutenant and the forensic anthropologist were the definition of an odd couple. But then, maybe that’s why it worked.
“Yep. He was so great all through Zach’s recovery.” A flash of pain crossed Monica’s face. She waved it away. “Anyway, a guy like that you gotta lock down, know what I mean?”
“Sure. How is Zach?” While they were working together Monica’s son had sustained serious injuries, almost becoming the final victim in the case. Kelly suddenly felt badly about falling out of touch. The last time she’d contacted Monica was over a year ago, by email. Of course, at least for the last seven months she had a decent excuse.
“Better. Not a hundred percent yet, but he’s taking classes at the community college. His short-term memory is still a little ragged, but…” Monica shrugged. “He’s alive. That’s all that matters.”
“Right.” Kelly cleared her throat, thinking that was an easy sentiment to express when you hadn’t faced the alternative. “Anyway, I should—”
“Oh my gosh, I must be keeping you from something. But listen, I’d love to grab coffee sometime. I leave tomorrow, and Howie and I have dinner plans tonight, but maybe the next time I’m in town? I come down every few weeks.”
“Yeah, sure. That sounds great,” Kelly responded mechanically. She dutifully entered Monica’s mobile number in her phone, knowing full well that she’d never call it, and that any messages Monica left would go unanswered.
“All righty, then. Great seeing you, Kelly. Can’t wait to sit down and have a real chat!”
Kelly watched Monica vanish back into the throng. It was nearly dusk and rush hour was about to start in earnest. She’d have to hurry if she didn’t want to end up standing in the subway car the entire ride home.
Before tucking her cell phone back in her purse, she reflexively checked the call log. Nothing today. Jake was out of town on business, but he usually called by now. She considered dialing, but a hard shove from behind almost sent her flying. Kelly gritted her teeth and put the phone away. All she wanted was a hot bath, a glass of wine and a Vicodin. Everything else could wait.
Jake Riley kept his eyes closed, listening to the bustle outside the door. If he concentrated he could distinguish voices, individual conversations. Someone at the water cooler was complaining about stalled negotiations in Colombia. Another voice was speaking Russian, a one-sided conversation over the phone. From down the hall, the distinctive sound of coffee brewing, accompanied by loud laughter. Above all that he registered stiletto heels clicking toward him. That gait he’d recognize anywhere.
He opened his eyes just as the door to his office was thrown open.
“Where are we on the Stanislav case?” Syd asked.
“Hello, Syd. Nice to see you, too.”
Syd Clement shut the door behind her, crossed the room and plopped down in the chair facing him. She eased her feet out of her heels and propped them up on the desk, inches from his own. At this distance, he could almost feel the heat coming off her stocking feet. He caught himself examining her perfect toes.
“The Stanislav case?” she prodded.
“Dubkova is handling it. He thinks one more week, max.”
“Yeah? Dubkova’s an idiot.” Syd’s toes tapped the a
“Syd, he’s been a rock star for us so far. Three successful negotiations, no casualties.”
“Those were in Russia. The Ukraine is a whole other beast. I know the Ukraine.”
Jake repressed a sigh. This pattern had become all too familiar. A month or so stateside and Syd got antsy. He’d already had to stop her from intervening in two other active cases that, in her opinion, were taking too long to resolve. What she failed to grasp was that in the private sector, patience and diplomacy usually produced better outcomes than strong-arm tactics. Syd was always a fan of the more forceful approach. Jake weighed his words before speaking. “I think Dubkova deserves another week. The kidnappers are starting to cave. He’s already talked them down another million. One more and we’re in the range that Centaur is willing to pay.”
“Fine. But if they don’t come down in a week, we send in a team.”
“Sure,” Jake agreed, knowing full well that by the end of the day Dubkova intended to have the ransom terms decided, which rendered the entire debate moot. And the prospect of an operation was guaranteed to preoccupy Syd until then.
The company they had co-founded a little more than a year earlier, The Longhorn Group, had taken off in leaps and bounds. They specialized in Kidnap and Ransom cases. Insurance companies that issued K&R insurance kept them on retainer.
Last July they had been the only two in the office. Now there were more than thirty full-time employees on payroll. When one of their clients was kidnapped they mobilized a team to respond, including specialists who coached the families on the negotiation process, and bodyguards to provide protection in case the kidnappers tried to snatch more victims. And if the negotiations fell apart, or the kidnappers became too volatile, The Longhorn Group sent in a recovery team comprised former Special Forces operatives. Their success rate thus far had been impressive: more than forty cases handled in less than a year. Most of the hostages were ransomed out at a price the insurance company was willing to pay. In ten cases they’d been forced to send in units to recover the hostage. Only one case had gone south, thanks to a trigger-happy kidnapper. That one still haunted Jake, but in the grand scheme of things, The Longhorn Group’s record couldn’t be better.
Of course, part of the boom could be attributed to the explosion in kidnappings worldwide. From the waters off the coast of Somalia to beach resorts in the Philippines to the sleepy streets of Silicon Valley, nowhere was completely safe anymore. In the past year they’d handled cases in Colombia, Guatemala, Italy, Spain, the United States and, increasingly, Russia, where kidnappings were becoming as ubiquitous as those nesting dolls hawked as souvenirs. There were rumors that in the recent elections, one party’s entire campaign was financed by ransom money.
Most people were unaware of what a successful ransom negotiation required, especially when an insurance company was involved. The kidnappers invariably made exorbitant demands, either financial or otherwise, in the first stages of negotiation. A frantic family, desperate to see their loved one released, would try to meet those demands. The problem was that paying the full ransom almost guaranteed that the same victim or another family member would be targeted in the future. In the mid-90s, a Hong Kong billionaire was snatched. His family paid the $10 million dollar ransom without any negotiation. A few years later, he was taken again, and this time the kidnappers wanted double the amount. Even though that ransom was also paid, the businessman was killed.
A seasoned hostage negotiator described it to Jake as roughly equivalent to buying a rug in a Moroccan bazaar. The kidnappers initially wanted something outrageous. A negotiator’s job was to bargain them down, convincing them that the family didn’t have that kind of money available, the insurance company refused to pay that much or that what they were asking for was simply impossible if it involved something like the release of political prisoners. A great negotiator wore the kidnappers down, until both parties agreed on an acceptable ransom. And with luck, the time and trouble involved meant that the hostage would be safe from future targeting.
Of course, the fact that human lives were at stake made the game more challenging. Walking away was simply not an option, although going in for a snatch and grab was. Which was why The Longhorn Group employed both highly trained negotiators and commandos. Always good to cover your bases.
“So. What else is on the docket?” Syd said.
Jake glanced at the papers on his desk, although he could cite their current cases off the top of his head. “Fribush just left Colombia, the tourists are all safe and sound. We’ve got Manchester handling that thing in Sardinia, and Jacobs is still in Croatia. Sumner called in from Pakistan, things aren’t going well over there.”
“Really?” Syd perked up. “I love Pakistan this time of year.”
“It’s January, no one loves Pakistan now. Besides, I thought we agreed you were on desk duty for a while.”
“It’s been a while. If I stay much longer, I’ll lose my mind. Look, I’m even starting to get fat.” Syd pinched a fold of cashmere sweater over her taut stomach.
Jake grinned. “You could use a little flesh on those bones.”
She tossed a paper clip at him. “Go to hell, partner.”
Jake’s phone buzzed, interrupting his retort. He pushed the speaker button. “Riley.”
“Your brother is here to see you.”
Jake raised an eyebrow. “Which one?”
“Oh, I didn’t know you had more than one.” His new secretary sounded flustered. “I’ll ask.”
“No, that’s okay. Send him in.”
Syd let out a low whistle. “One of the infamous Riley brothers, huh? This is exciting.”
Jake didn’t answer. His younger brother opened the door, a wrinkled overcoat draped over his arm. He was a younger, heavier version of Jake: same salt-and-pepper hair, same blue eyes. His face was flaming red, either from the cold or nerves. Jake walked around his desk to greet him. “Chris!” He embraced him. “What are you doing in town?”
“I, uh…” Jake followed his eyes and sighed. Syd tended to have that effect on men.
“Syd Clement.” She dropped her feet to the floor and extended a hand in one fluid motion. “I bet y some good Jake stories for me.”
“I guess.” Chris looked completely bewildered.
“Let me take that.” Jake peeled the jacket off his brother’s arm and hung it on the back of the door. “Have a seat.”
Chris nervously perched on the chair beside Syd, sticking to the edge farthest away from her. As Jake sat back down, he took inventory. He’d missed the family Christmas celebration since Kelly wasn’t up for it, so it had been over a year since he and his brother had seen each other. About that long since they’d spoken, too. Chris was an accountant, married his high school sweetheart, still lived in the town they grew up in. Other than their blood, they had nothing in common.
“So, Chris. What brings you to New York?” Syd asked, breaking the silence.
“Well, it’s kind of…private.”
“Really?” Syd arched an eyebrow and leaned forward in her chair. Chris shied away. “The plot thickens. I can’t wait to hear it.”
“Syd, take a hike,” Jake said. “We’ll finish up later.”
“I always miss the good stuff,” Syd huffed dramatically. She slipped on her heels one at a time, then pointed at Jake. “Remember, one more week and I’m on a plane to the Ukraine. You promised.”
“Bye, Syd.”
“Lovely meeting you, Chris.” She winked at him, then turned and left the room.
“So that’s your, uh…”
“Partner.”
“Right.” Chris looked around the office appreciatively, taking in the floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of Central Park, plush carpeting, oil paintings on the walls. Jake could almost see the calculator in his head tallying it up. “Looks like you’re doing okay.”
“It’s been going well. Better than I hoped, actually. How about you? Susie and the kids okay?”
“Oh, they’re good.” Chris examined his hands, chapped and ruddy from the weather. “Sure is cold here this time of year.”
“Sure is.” Jake fought the urge to grit his teeth. Chris always took forever to get to the point. He’d start with the weather, then move on to something equally innocuous, like sports. “So what’s this private thing?”
He hoped Chris wasn’t going to announce that he’d left his family and needed a place to stay. He had one of the most stable marriages Jake had ever seen, and besides, Kelly wasn’t really prepared to handle company yet.
“It’s Mark.”
Jake went cold. His older brother had joined the military straight out of high school. He was a lifer, ended up a Navy SEAL. And with wars going on in multiple countries, this wasn’t the best time to be an enlisted man. “What happened?”
“I’m not sure.” Chris plucked at the pleats in his corduroy pants.
Jake’s heart clenched. “Did you get notification?”
Chris shook his head. “Oh, no, nothing like that. He’s out of the service, anyway.”
Relief swept over Jake. He’d been braced to hear that Mark had been killed by a suicide bomber or an IED. “When did he get discharged?”
“About six months ago. He’s been working for this company.”
Jake couldn’t picture his rugged older brother in a suit and tie. “What company?”
“I have it here.” Chris dug around in his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper.
Jake had to squint to read it. “A tire company?”
“No, it’s Tyr Global.”
“You’re kidding,” Jake said. Tyr Global was the world leader in K&R work. They’d been in business for almost four decades, and pretty much wrote the book on hostage negotiation. “Doing what?”
“He didn’t say. But he showed up at our door a week ago, told me he was going out on an operation. If I didn’t hear back from him by the twenty-seventh, something went wrong. That was two days ago, Jake.” Worry furrowed his brow. “So I figured I’d better come see you. I didn’t know what else to do.”
Jake leaned back in his chair, frowning. “So he left the service and went to work for one of my competitors. Typical.”
Chris shrugged. “Probably reckoned you were still ticked off at him.”
“He would have reckoned right.”
“Would you have hired him?”
Jake’s face flushed. “I don’t know. Probably not.”
“Well, there you go, then.”
“So what do you expect me from me?”
Chris leaned forward in his chair and jabbed the desk with his index finger. “He’s our brother, Jake. And this is what your company does, right? You go in and save people.”
“You could have just called to tell me what happened.”
“I could’ve. But I wanted you to say no to my face. And if you won’t help, I leave for Mexico City tonight. End of story.” Chris crossed his arms and glared at him.
Jake drummed his fingers on his desk. “Even after what happened, you’re willing to risk your life for him?”
“Yup.”
“You don’t even speak Spanish.”
“Neither do you,” Chris retorted. “You know it’s what Mom would have wanted.”
The words hung in the air between them. Jake deliberated. The thought of Chris navigating the underbelly of Mexico City, one of the most dangerous metropolitan areas in the world, was laughable. He’d wind up getting himself killed. Jake sighed. “Tell me everything he told you. Where he was going, what was supposed to happen
“Yessir.” Chris looked relieved, and Jake felt a wave of pity. This had been a big burden for Chris to carry. He of all people knew that Mark would never want help from Jake. But whatever Mark had gotten himself into, it would take more than an accountant to get him back out.
Ten minutes later Jake eased closed the door to his office. After relaying everything he could remember, Chris had passed out cold on his couch—chances were he hadn’t slept much the past few days, sitting there waiting for his phone to ring. Jake walked down the hall to Syd’s office, waving off a few employees who tried to approach him. He rapped twice on the door before letting himself in.
Syd was lying on her couch, flipping through a magazine. “How’s the reunion going?” she asked without looking up.
“Not good. Look’s like my older brother has been kidnapped.”
“What?” She sat up. “Where?”
“He was running a snatch and grab for Tyr south of the border. Mexico City, Chris thinks, but he’s not a hundred percent sure. Something must have gone wrong. He was supposed to check in two days ago.”
“Maybe he’s holed up in some Tijuana bar celebrating,” Syd said skeptically.
“Not Mark.” Jake shook his head emphatically. “If he could call, he would have. You hear any chatter from Tyr?”
“No, but I can put out some feelers. I’ve got a guy over there.” Syd crossed to her desk, all business now. “Wasn’t Calderon snatched in Mexico City?”
“I was thinking the same thing,” Jake said. Although it wasn’t public knowledge, the head of Tyr Global had been kidnapped six weeks earlier. Tyr had gone to great lengths to keep word from getting out—after all, having their frontman snatched wasn’t good for business.
“They’d send their best to get him back,” Syd said thoughtfully as she tapped through screens on her computer. “Your brother that good?”
“Maybe. He spent more than two decades as a SEAL, tours in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq.”
“Sounds like my kind of guy,” Syd said approvingly.
“I’m sure he’d love you,” Jake said.
“Well, then, we’ll have to arrange a meeting. Give me ten minutes.”
Jake let himself out. He fought the urge to pace the halls while he waited. A few people looked up from their desks quizzically. Switching direction suddenly, he headed to the front desk, grabbing his jacket from the closet on the way out.
“Mr. Riley, are you—” his secretary called after him.
He ignored her, marching into the outer hall. He hooked right by the elevators and threw open the door to the roof. It wasn’t supposed to be accessible, but one thing he and Syd learned early on was that this line of work attracted smokers, and providing a place to indulge went a long way toward keeping them happy. With that in mind they’d struck a deal with the building’s management company to construct a small, sheltered space on the roof. Ducking in, he was pleased to find it unoccupied. He eschewed the chairs, preferring to pace the few feet back and forth.
Even in this weather, the view was striking. Central Park sprawled out below him, all stark branches and grass blanched gray. In the distance off to his left, he could see whitecaps on the reservoir, while to his right the Midtown skyline marched toward the glare of Times Square. Farther on, the tip of Manhattan merged with the horizon. Jake gnawed his lip, checking his watch. Jesus, Mark, he thought to himself. What the hell did you sign up for?
The creak of a door behind him and Syd appeared. She held the collar of an enormous fur coat up to shield her ears.
“Seriously, Jake, the roof? Make it a little harder on me, why don’t you.”
“What is it?” He could tell by her eyes the news wasn’t good.
Syd shook her head. “Tyr lost a team four days ago. They had good intel on where Calderon was being held and decided to move in quickly. Lost the whole team. Three found dead on site, the other five are missing.”
“Mark?”
“Not one of the DOAs. He was the team leader, so chances are they’d keep him alive.”
“What are they asking for him?” Jake’s chest had gone tight. In spite of himself, he pictured Mark swinging from a rope above the river they used to swim in, letting go at the top, arms pinwheeling as he vaulted through the air.
“That I couldn’t get—Tyr is going to great lengths to keep this quiet. You don’t want to know what I had to promise my guy for this intel.”
“Do they know where they were taken?”
Syd said, “Rumor has it they were all snatched by a Los Zetas offshoot. They pretty much own the eastern delegaciones, so Tyr is sending a team there.”
“Crap. This just keeps getting better,” Jake said.
Los Zetas were mercenaries who did the dirty work for Mexican drug cartels. They had kidnapping perfected to a science, executing the initial grab flawlessly, constantly moving their prisoners to thwart attempts to track them…They were the world’s best at what they did. None of which boded well for Mark and his unit.
“What do you want to do?” Syd asked, studying him.
Jake shook his head. “I don’t know. Maybe we call Tyr, offer to do a joint operation?”
“They won’t go for that.” Syd shook her head. “They’re still pissed off about the Lodi case. I doubt they’ll even take our call.”
“Well, shit, Syd, Mark’s my brother.” Jake ran a hand through his hair. “I can’t just leave him down there to rot.”
“So let’s go get him.”
“That’s nuts. Tyr will go ballistic.”
“If we run into them, we make it clear that they want trouble, we’re more than willing to give it to them—one press release about what happened down there, and they can kiss all their major contracts goodbye. And that’s if we even run into them.” Syd snorted. “Doesn’t sound like they’re the best of the best anymore. No offense,” she added.
Jake thought it over. The steady sleet tapered off, replaced by chunky white snowflakes. “All right,” he said finally. “But we’re not taking anyone off an active case. Who does that leave?”
“Fribush is already in the air en route to Texas, we can have him dropped off in Mexico City instead. So we’ve got him, you, me—”
“I need you to stay here and hold down the fort,” Jake protested. “We can’t both go.”
“The hell we can’t.”
“I mean it, Syd. One of us has to stay.” Jake didn’t add what they both knew he meant—if things went south, someone had to survive to keep running the firm.
“This is your brother, Jake. You need the best we’ve got on it.” Syd stared him down. “That’s me, and you know it.”
Jake started to argue, then thought better of it. Of all the trained operatives they had, Syd was the best by far. And she managed to inspire a blind loyalty in the men that no one else could duplicate. “Fine,” he finally agreed. “But I want Jagerson and Kane backing you up.”
“Perfect, I was going to suggest them,” she said. “And Maltz.”
“No way.” Jake shook his head. Michael Maltz had nearly been killed on their first case the previous July. Ever since he’d been undergoing extensive physical therapy. As far as Jake knew he hadn’t been cleared to go for a long walk, never mind conduct special operations.
“He’s fine, I checked him out myself,” Syd insisted.
“Checked him out how?”
“Ran him through the course at Langley, plus a few others. Trust me, he’s ready to come back. And aside from him, everyone else is committed to other cases.”
Jake mentally ran through their roster in his head: she was right, short of hiring a freelancer, all their other field operatives were assigned elsewhere. And freelancers were notoriously iffy. “That makes a team of six,” he said dubiously.
“Lean and mean, just how I like it.” Syd grinned.
Jake wished he shared her conviction. One thing about Tyr, they attracted top talent. If Mark had been ambushed, anyone could be. Considering the adversary they faced, he’d prefer going in with a small army.
“It’ll be fine, Jake. Trust me.” Syd glanced at her watch. “Nearly six o’clock. I’ll handle the travel logistics, you contact the rest of the team and reroute Fribush’s plane.”
“Okay.”
“Great. We’ll be out of here by midnight.”
Jake watched her head toward the stairwell. Unless he was mistaken, there was a distinct bounce in her step. Nothing cheered Syd up like the prospect of an armed confrontation.
His cell phone buzzed and he glanced at the caller ID: Kelly. Jake groaned inwardly. He’d arrived home late last night from a business trip to California and had opted to sleep at the office instead of going home. Jake told himself he didn’t want to wake her, but deep down he knew it was more than that. He gazed blankly out at the skyline. Kelly wasn’t going to like this. Since the accident it was almost overwhelming how needy she’d become. It was understandable, considering what she’d been through, but still. He barely recognized her anymore. Sometimes it felt like the Kelly he’d fallen in love with died in that explosion, and now he was living with her shadow.
Jake ran a hand across his face, wiping away stray drops of water. Dodging the issue wasn’t going to make it go away, but he couldn’t deal with it now. He had to save Mark. When he came back, they could have that talk.
He shook his head and went back inside.
