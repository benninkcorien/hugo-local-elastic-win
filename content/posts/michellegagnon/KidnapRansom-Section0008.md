Nine
Flores awoke with a throbbing headache. He groaned and shook his head to clear his vision.
He was in the back compartment of a large truck. Wherever they were going, the road was bumpy as hell. He’d been stuffed between two rough burlap sacks, probably to keep him from flopping around while unconscious, which struck him as surprisingly courteous. His hands were bound again, this time behind his back.
Shit, Flores thought with a sinking feeling.
Two other men occupied the space with him, both dressed in military fatigues and bearing LMTs. One couldn’t have been more than eighteen years old. The other was the guy who tried to blow up the van that morning.
The older man noticed he’d awoks eyes narrowed under the brim of his khaki cap, but he didn’t say anything.
“Mi amigo,” Flores tried. “Con la herida de bala. Y el otro. Dónde están?”
There was no response.
“Adónde vamos?” Flores asked.
The man jerked his head toward the kid. He stumbled over, bracing himself against the side of the truck as it bounced. Reaching Flores, he held up a roll of duct tape.
“Cállete,” he said.
The message was clear. Flores fell silent. The compartment was stuffy enough without having to struggle to breathe. They weren’t worried about him crying for help, since they didn’t insist on gagging him. They just weren’t interested in conversation.
They drove for hours, the road worsening until their pace slowed to a crawl. At one point they ascended so steeply he had to wrap his legs around one of the sacks to avoid being thrown against the rear door. Flores had never been prone to motion sickness. But riding in that windowless compartment, head still pounding from the blow he’d received, more than once he almost gagged up the tacos from that morning.
When they finally came to a stop, Flores felt a wave of relief. It dissipated as soon as the door slid open and he saw where he was.
Judging by the sun’s angle it was midafternoon. Light sheared through reams of barbed wire, stretching as far as he could see in either direction. Long lines of metal pens extended away from him. They looked like kennels—but instead of dogs, people were clustered in each. Most were filthy, their clothing worn to rags.
Next to the drug trade, kidnapping was one of Mexico’s biggest industries. Tyr had given a seminar when he first signed on, including a PowerPoint presentation filled with photos of jungle prison camps like the one he now faced. Captives were kept there for months or years as negotiations for their release dragged on. Thanks to the squalid living conditions, some of the hostages died long before their relatives managed to scrounge up a ransom payment.
At least in Mexico City, there was a chance that Tyr would track them down and rescue them. Here, Flores harbored no such delusions. It would take an army to free anyone from this camp.
A shove from behind sent him flying. With hands bound, there was no way to catch himself. Flores landed hard in the dirt, his knees bearing the brunt of the impact.
A pair of boots appeared an inch from his nose. Flores followed them up to find the van passenger staring down at him. He’d pegged him as a hard guy, someone you’d never mess with in a bar fight. He looked plenty pissed now.
“Sígame,” he said.
Flores stumbled to his feet and followed him along the dirt road. No point playing hero, he had to survive long enough to figure out an escape plan. For some reason, they were keeping him alive. He couldn’t imagine why, but as long as it worked in his favor he wasn’t about to question it.
People lined up at the pen doors as they passed, hands clutching the chicken wire. They watched his progress, but no one said a w were men, women, children of all ages.
They were in the mountains somewhere, a swath of land reclaimed from the jungle. It was even hotter here than in Mexico City, Flores’s shirt instantly soaked through. His eyes panned from side to side, taking in his surroundings. They passed a guard tower manned by two men, then another soldier on foot patrol. The guy slammed the butt of his rifle against random cages as he passed, causing the inmates to shy back. As Flores walked, he mentally composed a map of the facility.
The passenger finally stopped in front of a pen identical to the others. Six feet high, maybe ten feet long, eight feet wide. He nodded for the guard accompanying them to open the gate, then motioned Flores inside.
Flores took a deep breath and walked in, head bowed. The door swung shut behind him and was rebolted. A double lock, he noted. The chicken wire wasn’t thick, but a hundred feet away stood another guard tower constructed of rough-hewn beams. He watched as a muzzle scanned the pens in a long arc, then swept back. The guards seemed to be on top of things. Still, they couldn’t always be vigilant. He’d suss out their rotations, try to determine possible escape routes. Figure out the pen’s weaknesses and how to exploit them. Then at the first opportunity, he’d slip away. Flores had years’ worth of training, and it was a hell of a lot easier to survive in a jungle than the desert. One way or another, he told himself, he was making it out of here.
“Hatching a plan?” a voice behind him asked in English.
Startled, Flores spun around. A man ducked out of the sheltered rear of the pen. His clothes hung off him in shreds, and a thick beard draped down to his chest. Despite that, Flores recognized him immediately.
“Cesar Calderon,” the man said, extending his hand. “Nice to meet you.”
