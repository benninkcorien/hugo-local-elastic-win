Ten
“I’m Jake Riley, CEO of The Longhorn Group.”
Jake caught a flash of recognition in the black man’s eyes. He was tall, nearly six-three, muscles bulging out the sleeves of his camos. He glared down at Jake.
Jake started to lower his arms, but the gun muzzles weren’t coming down. He ended up with them in front of his chest, palms forward.
“You’re clearly lost, Mr. Riley,” the guy said. “Museums are on the other side of town.”
“You’re from Tyr,” Jake said. “Right?”
“Jake—” Kelly called out.
“We’re all on the same team here.” Jake chanced a small step forward.
The man cocked an eyebrow. “Last I checked, I didn’t work for The Longhorn Association.”
“Group,” Jake said. “The Longhorn—”
“Whatever. I don’t give a shit what you’re doing here, you’re in our way.”
From behind him, Syd called out, “Take it down a few notches, Brown.”
Frowning, the man shifted his aim. “Syd Clement. Should have known.”
“Miss me?”
Jake turned slightly. Syd was edging out from the side of the building. Despite the odds her gun was drawn, zeroed in on Brown’s chest. She approached slowly, placing her feet like she was walking a tightrope.
“She with you?” the guy asked, talking to Jake but keeping his focus on Syd.
“That depends,” Jake replied. “How do you two know each other?”
“Kiev. She nearly got my client’s kid killed.”
“The girl was fine, Brown. I can’t believe you still even remember that.”
“No thanks to you,” Brown retorted. “Syd nearly blew the whole raid. Told the head guy about it in advance, just so he’d let her at his hard drive.”
“National security was at stake.” Syd shrugged.
“Yeah, so to hell with everyone else. They had five hostages, including our girl,” Brown told Jake. “If I hadn’t moved up the start time of the operation, they all would have died. Fucking CIA.”
“Never been a big fan of them myself,” Jake said. “I was FBI.”
“They’re even worse,” Brown said. “Even you can do the math, Syd. Drop the gun.”
“I got a whole unit ready to pick you off.” Syd jerked her head toward the nearest building. Jake looked up and saw Fribush aiming down at them. He lifted his free hand in a wave.
“Great,” Jake muttered under his breath.
“There are five more just like him,” Syd said. “You won’t even be able to tell where the shots are coming from.”
“They start firing, you’re out a CEO,” Brown said.
Syd shrugged. “They grow on trees, especially in this economy.”
“We’re looking for Mark Riley,” Kelly called out. She’d lifted her head, but her hands remained on the roof of the car. “And we know you are, too.”
“So?” Brown said after a minute.
“So we should help each other.”
Brown tilted his head back and laughed openly. “Then we can all join hands and sing a song. This ain’t the Scouts, honey. You should leave this to the people who know what the fuck they’re doing.”
“Good point. Any advice on how to lose a whole unit?” Syd said.
Brown looked pained. “Wouldn’t have happened on my watch.”
“Sure it wouldn’t. Sounds to me like someone at Tyr sold them out. Maybe you’re next.”
A van turned down the street. They all shifted their attention to it. Jake waited for the to pull a one-eighty when he saw the firepower on display. When the van continued forward, he frowned. “What the—”
The street in front of them was suddenly torn up, bullets ricocheting off the pavement.
“Kelly!” Jake yelled, scanning the chaos for her red hair.
Everyone had scattered, breaking for cover. A member of the Tyr unit had taken a hit. He writhed on the ground, clutching his leg. Brown charged forward and grabbed him under the armpits, dragging him off the road.
Jake finally spotted Kelly cowering beside the nearest rental car, Maltz beside her. He bent over and said something in her ear, then grabbed her hand. Maltz slid open the car door and shoved her inside.
Jake paused for a second, deliberating. For the moment, Kelly was as safe as any of them. Safer, maybe, if they could get to the backup weapons in the car. Syd had raced behind the closest building. He followed her, wishing he’d held on to his gun.
The van was approaching fast, gaining speed. When it was less than a hundred yards away, Fribush and Jagerson returned fire from their rooftop sniper nests. Their bullets tore gaping holes in the van. The windshield shattered, but the occupants didn’t stop firing. Worse yet, the van continued accelerating.
Jake watched as the van suddenly veered crazily from side to side. It was going nearly fifty miles an hour when it hit the car Kelly and Maltz were in, climbing onto the trunk before flipping over and crushing the roof.
Jake was on his feet and running before the tires stopped spinning.
“Jake!” Syd yelled from behind him, but he didn’t stop. The van rested on its side across the roof of the car, hood slanted toward the ground. Jake saw a bloody hand trying to force the side panel open from the inside. Belatedly he realized that there were probably still armed men alive inside. And in all the excitement, he’d neglected to collect his gun.
Something whistled past his ear. There was a smattering of fire from behind him. Someone inside the van yelped in pain.
Syd came up alongside him.
“Thanks,” he said.
“Later. You check the car, I’ll cover you.” Syd squeezed off a few rounds into the side of the van. The bloody hand flopped down.
Jake dropped to his knees beside the rental car. The top had been completely crushed by the weight of the van, every window shattered. “Kelly!”
Jake tried to open the car door, but as he pulled on it the van groaned, shifting slightly. “Christ,” he muttered, skittering back. The van swayed, then stilled. Jake moved forward again, warily trying the front passenger door. If he could maneuver into the car, he could help them out of the backseat….
His hand was on the door handle when Kelly called his name. She walked out of the alley across the street.
“How the hell…”
“We went straight through the car.” Kelly ran up and wrapped her arms around“Michael thought it would be safer over there.”
Jake buried his face in her hair and dug a hand into it. Maltz stood silent a few feet away. “Thanks,” Jake said over her head. Privately he thought, Michael?
“No problem.” Maltz nodded. “Any survivors in the van?”
The Tyr unit had reemerged from the shadows. Two of them attended to their fallen comrade, tightening a tourniquet around his leg to staunch the bleeding. The rest edged toward the van, guns up and ready.
“Ayúdenme!” A voice pleaded from the interior.
On a three count, four members of the Tyr team shoved the van hard. The front left fender hit the ground first, followed by the rest of it. It kicked up a cloud of dust as it settled.
“Sal!” Brown called out. “Y no lo matamos.”
After a minute, a Mexican in army fatigues crawled out the hole where the windshield had been. Shakily he stood, arms high.
“I hurt!” he called in a thick accent. “Hospital.”
Brown walked forward and grabbed him by the collar. “Trust me, my friend, you’ll hurt a hell of a lot more when we’re done with you.”
