Seventeen
Jake stripped off his pants and looked around for a place to hang them, finally draping them over the ancient TV in the corner. The cuffs dripped muddy water onto the matted green carpet. He was in another crappy motel room, nearly as bad as the last. Not that he cared: right now, all he wanted was to scrub off the dirt and get five solid hours of sleep. Although, after all he’d been through, the temptation to just drop into bed was overwhelming, shower be damned. From the look of things, the sheets had already seen their share of filth.
Hours earlier they’d filed back into the jungle wrapped in silence, leaving Mark and Decker behind. As the shadows grew, they quickened their pace. Still, most of the way they were forced to stumble through the dark, afraid to use flashlights. Jake had never been so wet and muddy in his entire life.
After making it back to the jeeps, they drove to a town ten miles down the road, an enclave filled with the sort of souvenir shops that sprouted like mushrooms near tourist attractions. Shabby taco stands and motels sporting a variety of pyramid motifs dotted the landscape. This time of year, there were few other cars. They had eaten in silence, the only customers in an open-air restaurant. As Jake choked down rice and beans, a dog wandered in and nonchalantly pissed on the leg of their table. Which pretty much summed up the entire experience for him so far.
He was about to turn on the shower when there was a knock at the door. Jake wrapped a towel around his waist and opened it. Syd leaned against the doorjamb. She’d already changed, her blond hair was still wet.
“I was just about to chip the mud off,” Jake said.
She came in, closing the door behind her. “Want to borrow my chisel?”
“Girls don’t have chisels. Even I know that,” Jake said.
She grinned at him. “You’d be surprised.”
Jake was suddenly hyperconscious of his nudity. He took a step back, gesturing to the only chair in the room. “Have a seat.”
Syd eyed it. “That thing looks like it could walk on its own. No, thanks.”
“So what’s up?” Jake asked. He was a little discomfited by the way she was looking at him, like a cat appraising a meal.
“What’s that scar from?” she asked finally, pointing to his chest.
“Mark, actually.” Jake looked down at the rough circle. “Shot me with a BB when I was twelve.”
“On purpose?”
“Yup. I told him he couldn’t aim for shit.” In spite of himself, Jake smiled a little at the memory. They’d been out squirrel hunting with their Christmas presents, matching BB guns. They both kept missing, goading each other about it. But Mark was the one with the temper.
“So he sh
“What, he doesn’t seem the type?” Jake raised an eyebrow, and she laughed.
“Ah, sibling rivalry.”
“I don’t even know if you have any brothers or sisters,” Jake said. “You never talk about your family.”
She stiffened almost imperceptibly before saying, “Nothing to tell.”
“C’mon, let’s have it. You’ve seen my scar.”
“We should try to come up with a plan.”
“See? Whenever I ask, you change the subject.”
“Why do you want to know?” Syd stepped closer. It was a small room. She was a foot away, the bed right behind him.
“Just curious,” Jake said, suddenly overly aware of his breathing. He tried to force his mind back to Kelly, but she suddenly felt infinitely far away, more a memory than a reality.
Syd reached out and ran a fingernail around the ridges of the scar, outlining it. Her gaze never left his face. His body responded to her touch. Jake readjusted the towel and edged back until the hem of the comforter brushed his heels.
Syd half smiled. Her hand was still on him. She trailed her fingers down his chest. Jake sucked in his breath as they grazed his belly button and kept going.
“It’s a bad idea.”
“That’s what you said back in Livermore,” she reminded him, stepping closer. “Only then, you were more convincing.” One deft tug and his towel fell to the floor. Both of her hands were on him now. He tried to object as she sank to her knees, but as she took him in her mouth his head dropped back.
“Oh, God,” was all he could manage.
Her tongue was all over, teasing him. He fell into the rhythm, her hands running up and down his legs, setting the small hairs on end.
He was getting close when something started beeping. Syd pulled her head away.
“That’s the radio,” she said, getting up.
“Leave it.” Jake put his hands on her shoulders, but she resisted. She kept her body close to him, rubbing her breasts against his chest as she dug the radio out of her pocket.
Mark’s voice crackled through. “We’ve got some intel for you. I can transmit it.”
“Great,” she said. “The satellite uplink is open. Send what you’ve got.”
“Roger. Check back when you’ve read it.”
Syd set the radio down on the table and turned back to Jake.
He had retrieved the towel and wrapped it back around his waist. “So, uh…you should probably…”
Syd was unbuttoning her shirt. “Oh, we’ve got time. At least ten minutes until the transmission comes through. The satellite reception here is for shit.” The shirt slipped to the floor
“Syd—”
“I know, you’re engaged.” She unzipped her pants, and they dropped next to her shirt. She approached slowly, wearing only light blue panties. “If you want me to stop, I will.”
She put both hands on his chest and pushed. Jake fell back onto the bed. As she mounted him, she nuzzled his ear and whispered, “You’re already dirty, so we might as well have some fun.”
