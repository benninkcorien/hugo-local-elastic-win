MARCH 15
Forty-Eight
Syd glanced up at the knock on her door. Mark Riley was propped on a crutch, looking uncomfortable in a wool suit.
“I’m headhe said. “Sure you can hold down the fort?”
Syd shuffled the pile of papers in front of her. Since the implosion of Tyr, their business had kicked up exponentially. She’d taken on a dozen new clients, hired more employees. Staying busy had helped her deal. Now, though, things were settling down. “Flores is running point on the Somalia situation. I think we’re all set.”
“Great.”
“Anything else?” Syd said, looking up to find him still standing there.
“Just wanted to make sure you hadn’t changed your mind about coming.”
Syd avoided his eyes. “I already said goodbye. Besides, we’re swamped right now.”
“All right, then.” He paused. “Thing is, I know what it’s like not to get closure. Made that mistake once myself.”
“It’s just a memorial service,” Syd said sharply. Jake’s body had been cremated weeks earlier. It had taken some time to arrange, but they were going to bury some of his ashes in a grave beside his mother’s in Texas.
“I know, but it might help.”
“I’m fine,” she said. “Have a safe trip.”
He left, easing the door shut. Syd sank back in her chair and gazed out the window. Spring was arriving in Central Park, through the window she could see smatterings of green among the gray. Early blooms were battling the resurgence of low temperatures. She got up after a minute and went to her office door. Opening it, she stared down the hall.
The door to Jake’s office was closed. She hadn’t been able to bring herself to reassign it yet. By all rights it should go to Maltz, since he’d assumed a larger role in the company. Kelly had come by a few weeks earlier and removed a box of personal items. Now all that remained was standard office equipment. Still, she couldn’t bring herself to change the name on the door.
Syd hesitated a moment, then walked down the hall. She entered the office and shut the door behind her. Funny, she wasn’t generally a sentimental person. And it wasn’t as if Jake was ever really more than a friend anyway. Still, she could swear there was a trace of his scent in the air. She crossed the room and slowly sank into the chair behind his desk.
Syd rubbed an indentation in the oak with her thumb, the spot where he always rested his heels when he kicked back in his chair. She half smiled, remembering his grin, the laughter in his voice when he teased her.
After a moment she picked up the phone. “Call the engravers,” she said, voice throatier than usual. “Have them make up a name plate for Maltz.”
Kelly stood beside the freshly dug grave, gazing down without seeing it. Rodriguez had just left with his wife, after squeezing her elbow and offering the standard condolences. He was back on active duty after a brief suspension—somehow McLarty had managed to smooth things over with the Mexican Consulate. Apparently the U.S. government would provide a loan to assist with future excavations on the Templo Mayor site.
Stefan had been buried in a pauper’s cemetery somewhere outside Mexico City. Kelly hadn’t asked where, and Rodriguez hadn’t offered the information. At night when she stared up at the ceiling, unable to sleep, she could still feel that gun in her hands.
A few other mourners shuffled around, shaking hands, conversing in low voices. Kelly felt a presence at her side but didn’t look up.
“Should have been me,” Mark said after a moment.
“That’s what I keep thinking,” Kelly said. “He wouldn’t have been there if it wasn’t for me.”
“None of you would have been there if our mission hadn’t been compromised. You can’t blame yourself.”
Kelly looked at him. Mark had lost weight during his hospital stay. Gaunt hollows carved out his cheeks. His suit hung loosely around his shoulders. In some ways it made the resemblance to Jake stronger.
“I heard you went to work for Longhorn.”
“Yup. Should have been there all along, I was just too damn stubborn.” He shook his head. “My mom always used to say that if you spend your life racing the devil, eventually he’ll win. But she meant me, not Jake. Every time we got into trouble, it was my idea.” He nudged a chunk of loose sod with the heel of his crutch. “I still can’t believe he’s gone.”
Kelly couldn’t answer. She stood rigid, staring down at the dusty mound of soil.
“I’m scattering some of his ashes in this gully we used to hang out in when we were kids, if you want to come along,” he offered after a moment. “Chris and Susie are having people over, too.”
“I know, they invited me. I just… I can’t.”
“Okay.” He nodded, then reached over and awkwardly hugged her. “Hang in there, okay?”
“You, too.”
He swung around on his crutches. Kelly heard an engine start, the sound of a car pulling away. She couldn’t move. She kept waiting for tears to come, but since that first day none had. She was numb inside. Kelly had barely stopped moving since the plane landed in New York. Without allowing herself to think about it, she found a new apartment and moved overnight. Packed up all of Jake’s things and shipped them off to Chris. All she had left was a stack of photos and a windbreaker she’d found on the final pass through their empty apartment, tucked away in the far corner of their bedroom closet. She’d pressed it to her face, remembering when Jake wrapped it around her shoulders on a blustery day, but still—nothing.
“What are you going to do now?” someone asked.
She turned to find Maltz gazing levelly at her. “I have no idea.”
“Syd would be happy to take you on.”
“No, she wouldn’t.” Kelly managed a tight smile.
“I could get her to do it anyway,” Maltz offered.
“I’m not cut out for that.” The clouds overhead parted, and the rays of a weak winter sun sifted through. “I’m tmy boss back at the FBI on Monday. Maybe they’ll put me on active duty.”
“Good luck with that.”
“Thanks,” Kelly said.
They stood in silence for a few more minutes. Then Kelly forced herself to turn and walk back to her rental car, arms wrapped tight against the cold.
