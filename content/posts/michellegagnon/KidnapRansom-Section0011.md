“I know who you are,” Flores said. “I actually work for you.”
“Really?” Calderon’s eyebrows shot up. “In what capacity?”
“Special Ops.”
Calderon laughed sharply. “Let me guess,” he said. “You’re here to rescue me.”
“It’s a long story,” Flores replied uncomfortably. The irony of the situation wasn’t lost on him. As far as he knew, Kaplan was dead, Riley and Decker were captured or killed, and Sock…who the hell knew where Sock was? What he’d witnessed earlier didn’t bode well for the guy’s innocence. And the fact that Sock wasn’t here rendered him all the more guilty in Flores’s eyes. If there was another Tyr unit in the country, they were probably still scouring Mexico City for them. All in all, he had no good news to offer.
“I’ll get us out of here,” Flores finally replied. With a sinking feeling, he realized that encountering Calderon complicated his escape plan a thousandfold. Alone, he’d easily survive a few weeks in the jungle. But Calderon had to be in his late fifties, and the weeks he’d already spent in captivity had clearly taken a toll. He was gaunt, emaciated. He’d only slow Flores down. He flashed back on Maryanne’s face again.
“That’s all right, son.” Calderon patted his shoulder awkwardly. “We’ve had lots of practice getting people back from places like this. I’m sure Linus Smiley is on top of it.”
“I’m sure he is, sir,” Flores said. He debated how much to tell him about his suspicions. Calderon was already in bad shape, he decided. No need to worry him, especially when there wasn’t a damn thing they could do about the situation.
“I’m surprised they haven’t come for proof of life, though,” Calderon mused. “I have to say, if I was on the other side of this, I’d be wondering what the hell is going on. I’m guessing the board isn’t taking it well.”
“I wouldn’t know, sir,” Flores said.
“No, of course you wouldn’t.” Calderon smiled wanly. “Well, at least now I have someone to pass the time with. Do you play chess?”
Flores shook his head.
“Then this is the perfect opportunity to learn.” Calderon went to the rear of the pen. After scrounging around for a minute, he produced a rolled up piece of felt. Carrying it back, he carefully unfurled it. Squares had been drawn on in chalk. Some of the pieces were recognizable, others were just chips of wood.
“I haven’t had time to carve the entire set,” Calderon said apologetically. “And part of me is hoping I won’t get the chance to finish. You should see the one I have at home. Mahogany, with—”
“They gave you a knife?” Flores interrupted, his mind immediately clicking through the possibilities.
“I traded for some cigarettes. It’s not very sharp,” he said. “Some of the guards are better than others. If you need anything, I can discreetly ask around.”
“Thanks,” Flores said.
“Not a problem. Now, let me show you how to set up the board. Chess takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master…”
Flores tuned out Calderon’s chatter as he watched him fastidiously arrange the motley pieces on the felt. There was something off about the guy. Maybe it just stemmed from spending weeks in this hellhole, but still—this was a man who had developed a reputation as the master of K&R work worldwide. Flores would never have guessed that he’d spend his confinement patiently awaiting a rescue—playing chess, no less. Wouldn’t he want to seize the opportunity to help plan an escape? What the hell was going on here? Flores’s mind shifted back to their failed raid. Maybe Sock had sold them out on orders from above. Maybe the entire thing was a setup. But why?
“Your move,” Calderon said with a grin.
Syd leaned against the wall nearest the door observing the reunion. It was far from warm, despite the circumstances. Of course, if she ran into a family member out in the field, it would probably go down the same way.
They were in a dingy motel room at the intersection of Maria Eugenia and De Los Angeles. The neighborhood hadn’t improved much from where they spent the morning, and this motel was no exception. In comparison, the place they stayed in yesterday was practically a Four Seasons. Cement flooring peeked through worn patches in the brown rug. The bed sloped distinctly to the right and sported a comforter that didn’t appear to have been laundered since the Kennedy administration. Music blared from a battered clock radio that Jake had set to something tinny to cover their discussion. Mark winced when he turned it on, but didn’t say anything. There was a funky smell, too—funny how cheap motel rooms all shared the same tang of cigarette smoke, stale food, body odor and something else she couldn’t quite pin down.
Eight of them packed into the space made it all the more comical. Maltz, Jagerson, Fribush and Kane had finally excused themselves,hey’d keep an eye out for hostiles. Syd suspected they just needed some air.
The Feeb sat on the bed rubbing her leg, looking even more agitated than usual. Syd watched her fidget. What could possibly be eating her now? They’d accomplished what they’d set out to do and emerged unscathed. In her book, that counted as a win.
Mark Riley was better looking than Syd had expected. About an inch taller than Jake, with more muscle packed on a similar frame. Same blue eyes, hair almost completely gray, but otherwise they could have passed for twins. Right now they even shared the same pissed-off look. Ah, family, she thought with a sigh. Always a drag.
“You’re not hearing me,” Mark growled.
“I heard you just fine,” Jake retorted. “Your men weren’t there when you got back, so you’re assuming the Zetas caught up with them. But maybe they had to move because their location was compromised, and they had no way of letting you know. Maybe they managed to get in touch with Tyr, and they’re already on a plane home. You’re making a lot of assumptions here.”
“Kaplan was there,” Mark argued. “Still warm. And the room stank from a flash bang.”
“Fine.” Jake rubbed his eyes wearily. “So the Zetas got them again. Or someone else did. What the hell can you do about it?”
“I’m not leaving them here,” Mark said.
“They have my father, too,” the girl chimed in. “I know where they’ve probably taken them.”
Syd eyed her. Pretty thing, a little mousy but with good bone structure. Somehow she’d already managed to wrap Mark Riley around her little finger, that was clear.
“What was your name again?” Jake asked.
“Isabela,” she said, drawing herself up. Syd smirked at the gesture. It was impossible to look imposing when you were five-four, but she gave her credit for trying.
“No offense, Isabela, but I came to get my brother back. Mission accomplished. Now I just want to get the hell out of here.” Jake plunked down on the bed beside Kelly.
“Well, I’m staying.” Mark glanced at the other surviving member of his team, who nodded. “Decker, too. If you could loan us some weapons—”
“Jesus Christ.” Jake exhaled deeply. “These guys beat you before, and that was when you had a full team. Two of you going after them like this is suicide, it won’t matter if we give you bazookas.”
“I’ll take a bazooka,” Decker interjected. “You got any?”
“No, but we can lend you a few AKs,” Syd said.
“That’ll work,” Decker said. “Much appreciated.”
Jake shot a glare at her. “You’re not helping.”
She shrugged. “They’re going whether you want them to or not.”
“At least tell me you’ll join up with the rest of your guys. Brown had two units with him,” Jake said. Decker and Mark exchanged a look. “What?”
“Not sure we can trust Tyr,” Mark finally responded. “That’s why I called you.”
Jake examined a bare patch of floor by his feet. “Where do you think they’re being held?” he finally asked, raising his eyes.
“Jake,” Kelly said warningly.
“They have a prison camp in the Veracruz mountains. It’s about two hundred miles northeast of here,” Isabela said. “I know they have my father there.”
“How do you know?” Syd asked.
Isabela turned, appraising her. “A friend with information on Los Zetas told me.”
Huh, Syd thought. Despite her mousy appearance, the girl had a certain look about her that Syd recognized. And it wasn’t that of a scared novice in way over her head. She wondered why the hell Isabela was so gung ho for them to raid this camp.
“A prison camp,” Jake said. “So we’re talking dozens of guards, at least.”
Isabela glanced at Mark before replying. “Probably more,” she said. “It’s inside one of their main bases.”
“Fantastic,” Jake said. “How the hell are you gonna grab your guys and get out without a dozen bullets in your back?”
“We’ll come up with something. I’ve done it before,” Mark reminded Jake. “Hell, I was doing this sort of thing when you were still in high school.”
“Yeah, and look how well that worked out for you,” Jake said.
Mark didn’t reply, but his hands clenched into fists. Syd wondered again what the hell they’d been fighting about all these years. Whatever it was must be juicy.
“There’s nothing I can say to stop you?” Jake sounded bone-weary.
“Nope.”
“You should go with him,” Kelly said. “Or at least let them have Kane and Jagerson.”
“I’ll go.” Syd jumped in. Jake threw her a look. “What? I’ve got nothing better to do.”
“Did you hear the part about this being a suicide mission? They’re not even sure their guys are there,” Jake argued.
“Yeah, well. I love to travel, and I’ve never seen that part of the country before.”
“I can’t commit any of my people to this,” Jake said. “If they go, it’s voluntarily.”
“I’ll ask them,” Syd offered. She strolled outside, the silence behind her thick enough to cut with a knife. It was a relief to close the door. Times like this reminded her why she’d cut off contact with her own family.
Syd strolled down the cement path in front of the rooms, her guard up. Dusk had fallen, and with it dozens of neon signs flared to life down the street. Theirs was only car in the parking lot.
“Hey,” someone said in a low voice.
She turned to find Maltz tucked into an alcove that once housed a vending machine, stray wires still dangled from the wall.
“Where are the others?”
“Fribush crashed out in the car and Jagerson and Kane went for a beer. Figured if anything went down they’d be close enough to hear it. How’s it going in there?”
“Remind me never to host them for Thanksgiving,” Syd said.
Maltz made a sound that she recognized as his version of a laugh. “Close call today,” she said. “How you holding up?”
“I’ve had closer.”
His eyes were cast in shadow. Still, Syd detected a shift in his voice. “Here’s the deal,” she said. “Riley Senior wants to go looking for his men. He thinks they’re in a prison camp crawling with Zetas up in the mountains. They’re looking for volunteers.”
“You going?”
Syd grinned. “How could I not?”
“Then I’m in.”
“You sure?” Syd asked. “Odds aren’t good.”
“Gotta die sometime, right?” Maltz said.
“Hopefully not tomorrow,” Syd said. “I got a hell of a 401K going now. You do, too.”
“My dog will live well, then.”
“You have a dog?” The thought was preposterous.
“Sabine. She’s a French bulldog.”
An image of Maltz strolling along behind a tiny white dog popped into Syd’s head and she cracked up.
“Go ahead and laugh. She’s tough as they come.”
“I’m sure.” Syd wiped a tear from her cheek. “It’s good to have you back, Maltz. We get out of this, I’m buying you one of those doggie purses to carry her around in.”
“I’m man enough to handle that.”
“I figured. Stay here, I’ll go check with Kane and Jagerson.”
“They’ll come,” Maltz said.
“I know.” Syd paused, wondering for a second if she’d completely lost her mind. She’d nearly gotten Maltz killed once before, and now she was dragging him into something that was really none of their business. If nothing else, that made her a lousy boss.
“Don’t worry about it,” Maltz said, as if reading her mind. “I’d be going anyway. You don’t leave a man behind.”
“These aren’t our men,” Syd reminded him.
“Might as well be.”
“Yeah, I guess you’re right
Fribush was snoring in the reclined passenger seat of their rental car. Opting to let him sleep, Syd walked down the block toward the bar. A beam of yellow light from the open door bisected the pavement. The jukebox inside sputtered out songs she recognized from her teens. Christ, she thought. It’s like entering a goddamn time machine.
Kane and Jagerson sat on adjoining bar stools, the only patrons inside. In front of them two bottles of beer sweated beads of water. They fell silent as she approached. They were an odd pair. Kane was enormous, easily six-four, with a protruding brow, dark hair and big ears. Jagerson was smaller but wider, with close-cropped blond hair, freckles and green eyes. They couldn’t have looked more out of place if they’d tried. It was no wonder the locals cleared out when they entered.
“Hiya, boss,” Kane said. “All set in there?”
Syd ran down the situation for them, keeping her voice low. She knew from experience that whatever one decided, the other would follow.
“When do we move out?” Kane asked.
“Tomorrow at dawn,” Syd said. “Tonight we’ll need to resupply for the jungle.”
“I’m on it,” Kane said, sliding off the stool. Jagerson dumped a handful of pesos on the counter and they followed her out into the night.
The man’s head snapped back from the blow. Blood streamed down his cheek from a cut below his eye. Linus wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Are you sure this is necessary?” he said. “I heard that torture doesn’t work.”
“This isn’t torture, sir. It’s the fine art of persuasion,” Ellis Brown said.
The two of them stood in the far corner of the room observing the proceedings.
“What if he’s telling the truth? He might not know where they’re keeping Cesar.”
“If he doesn’t know, he can lead us to someone who does,” Brown said. “It’s all about climbing the food chain.”
The man moaned. Linus had arrived ten minutes into the interrogation. His flight to Mexico City had been delayed twice en route. He was climbing out of his skin with frustration by the time the taxi dropped him off a few blocks away. Brown had secured an abandoned building on the outskirts of the district. Apparently the unit moved their base daily so as not to attract attention.
In spite of himself, Linus was secretly thrilled to be here. He was one of the few Tyr employees without any military- or covert-operations experience. His years at the Agency had been spent compiling reports. He’d managed to claw his way up the ladder via sheer force of will, by being better at his job than everyone else. Linus knew that some viewed him as a glorified pencil pusher, which irked him to no small degree. Part of the reason he got on a plane was to prove he was as capable of this sort of thing as Cesar.
Unfortunately that meant bearing witness to displays such as this.
The man assigned by Brown to administer punishment drew back his fist again, fingers wrapped around a set of brass knuckles. As he swung in with an uppercut, Linus winced in anticipation. The prisoner took the blow on his chin. It knocked loose one of his teeth, sending it skittering across the floor.
“Where are they keeping Cesar Calderon?” he growled again in Spanish.
“No sé,” the man replied, wheezing from the effort.
Brown motioned the interrogator over and whispered something in his ear. The man nodded, then strolled back and bent over to look directly in the prisoner’s eyes. “Who do you work for?”
Something akin to relief passed over the man’s bloodied features. “Fuentes,” he said. “Vicente Fuentes.”
“Fuentes?” Linus frowned. “Isn’t he with the Sinaloa Cartel?”
Brown hesitated a moment before replying, “Yessir.”
“I thought the Zetas ran the Gulf Cartel.”
Brown didn’t answer. Emboldened, Linus walked forward. “Ask him if he’s part of Los Zetas.”
The prisoner’s attention shifted to him. At the word “Zetas,” his eyes widened and he jabbered excitedly in Spanish.
“What’s he saying?”
“He claims he’s not one of them, sir,” the interrogator translated.
“So why the hell did they attack your unit?”
The prisoner was still chattering away. A cuff from the interrogator shut him up. “He says there’s a turf war, they assumed we were Zetas. They have orders to shoot any they see on sight.”
“Let me get this straight,” Linus said slowly, enunciating each word as he turned back to Brown. “We’re interrogating someone who probably has no connection whatsoever to Cesar’s kidnapping.”
“We’re not a hundred percent certain the Zetas have him, sir. That was just the buzz we heard.” Brown looked uncomfortable.
“Good Lord.” Linus removed his glasses and took a cloth out of his jacket pocket to polish them. “Cut him loose.”
“All due respect, we can’t do that, sir.”
“Why not?”
“Whatever cartel he’s with will come down hard on us.”
The prisoner’s gaze shifted back and forth between them. He said something, then repeated it more forcefully.
“Now what?” Linus grumbled.
“He’s saying there’s a Zetas prison camp in the jungle near Veracruz.”
“Fine. He’ll take us there.” Linus waved a hand to quell Brown’s next words. “Sounds to me like the only lead we have. Your search of the city hasn’t produced any results, so they’re probably being held somewhere else.”
“We haven’t completed that search, sir,” Brown argued
“Do you think you ever will? It’s been days, and you haven’t found any sign of Cesar or the rest of the team.”
Brown appeared enraged at this usurping of his authority. “It’s hard to say, sir,” he finally replied. “They might keep moving them.”
“Or maybe they were never here to begin with. Time to explore other options.” Linus strolled to the door feeling rather pleased with himself. Maybe now the board would appreciate what he brought to the table. Cesar might return as the public face of Tyr, but clearly he wasn’t enough of a big-picture visionary to move them forward into the future. That required a whole different skill set, one Linus had mastered.
All in all, things were turning out better than expected.
