“Nothing to discuss, lady,” Brown said. “We’ll drop you a line when we recover our hostages. Have a nice flight home.”
Jake reappeared, slipping an arm around her waist. Kelly could tell by his expression that something had happened, but it was hard to say if it was good or bad.
“Let’s go,” Jake said to Syd.
Her hackles rose. “Screw that. I’m not letting them—”
“We don’t need them,” Jake said. He rubbed Kelly’s back reassuringly.
“This is bullshit, Jake.”
“Seriously, Syd. Let it go.” He stepped away from Kelly and grabbed Syd’s elbow, steering her toward their sole remaining rental car.
“What’s going on?” Brown asked.
“None of your concern, apparently,” Kelly said.
She followed Jake and Syd, sensing the weight of Brown’s eyes on her back.
Syd continued protesting as Jake propelled her into the passenger seat. “Radio Jagerson, Fribush and Kane, tell them to meet us at the corner of Maria Eugenia and De Los Angeles. It’s about a click away.”
“This is crap, Riley,” s. “We could have taken them.”
Despite that, she picked up the radio and relayed the instructions.
Jake held the rear door open for Kelly and she climbed in. Maltz slid in the other side. He glanced at her, and she shrugged. Jake climbed into the driver’s seat and pulled away. Brown remained stock-still in the middle of the street, watching them leave. As they turned the corner, Jake said, “I told you, we don’t need them.”
“Are you kidding? They’ve got someone to interrogate. That guy might tell them where your brother is.”
“That’s what I’m saying, Syd.” A grin split Jake’s face as he said, “I don’t need anyone to tell me. I already know.”
“What?”
“We’re on our way to meet Mark now. Then we can get out of this shithole,” Jake said, “and Brown can do whatever the hell he wants.”
