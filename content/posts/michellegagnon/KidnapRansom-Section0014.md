Fifteen
“We need to get moving.” Linus impatiently paced the narrow channel between the bed and the bathroom. “This is ridiculous.”
“It would be ridiculous if we went out there unprepared.” Brown sat calmly at the motel room desk, playing a game of solitaire. Their departure had been delayed when they couldn’t get some equipment that Brown deemed essential to their mission. What those things were, he hadn’t shared. Linus suspected he was stalling to save face. Now it was nearly dusk, and there was no sign that they were leaving anytime soon.
“Shouldn’t you be doing something?” he finally exhorted.
As Brown slowly stood, glowering down at him, Linus was struck by the realization that anything could happen to him down here, and Brown could spin it however he wanted. His own men could riddle him with bullets and blame the Zetas, or they could claim that he never showed up. He swallowed, hard. “Sorry, I’m just—”
A knock at the door interrupted him. Brown opened it a crack after checking through the curtain. One of his men stood there looking agitated. They exchanged a few words in low voices, then Brown shut the door again.
“There’s a complication,” he said, frowning.
“Another one?” Linus couldn’t contain his exasperation.
“I’ll be right back,” Brown said, stpping on his sidearm.
“I’ll come with you,” Linus insisted.
Brown looked ready to object, then shrugged and said, “Suit yourself.”
Linus followed him along the corridor and down two rooms. Brown knocked on the door to Room 17. It opened.
This motel room was identical to the other: a sagging queen-size bed, a desk marred by years-worth of accumulated abuse and a rickety chair. Two members of the Tyr team stood at opposite ends of the room. A large man dressed in ratty jean shorts and a soiled T-shirt tilted back in the chair, feet on the bed opposite. At the sight of Brown he slowly rose to his feet. He looked familiar, but it took Linus a second to place him.
“Wysocki,” Brown said. “So you finally made it home.”
“Hey, boss.” Wysocki’s arrogant smirk faded slightly at Brown’s approach.
“Where’s the rest of your team?”
“Dunno.” Wysocki shrugged. “Kaplan got himself shot, so Riley and Decker went out for meds. They were taking a long time, so I left Flores with Kap and went out for food and a phone. Came back, and everyone was gone. Waited awhile for Riley and Decker, but they never showed. Then I called you.”
“Funny you didn’t call as soon as you got away.” Brown’s eyes narrowed.
“I was under orders.”
“Whose?”
“Riley’s.” Wysocki lowered his voice. “I think he might’ve been in on it, sir. We were ambushed at the site. The Zetas had a mole.”
“So who planned the escape?”
“Mostly Decker and me, sir. Man, I hope Decker’s okay. Riley might’ve just handed them all over to those assholes again.” Wysocki glanced at the other men in the room. “Heard you were headed into the jungle after them. I’d love to come along.”
“I’m not sure—” Linus interjected.
“We’re already down one man,” Brown said. “Suit up, Wysocki.”
With that he turned and left the room.
Something flashed across Wysocki’s face. Linus couldn’t be sure, but it looked like triumph. He scurried after Brown, who strolled back to their room as if he hadn’t a care in the world. Brown plunked back down in the chair and shuffled the deck of cards.
“I know he’s one of your men,” Linus said, “but what makes you think—”
“I don’t trust him, either. Friends close but enemies closer, right?”
“I suppose. But what if he reveals our plans to the Zetas?”
“He’ll be under surveillance the whole time, without a functioning radio. If he is working with them, he could be a valuable source of intel.”
“What about Riley?” Linus asked. “I know he hasn’t been with Tyr l—”
“As far as I’m concerned, every one of those men is a liability,” Brown said. “When we find them, they’ll be treated as hostiles until proven otherwise.”
Flores scraped the bottom of his plate with a rusty spoon, making sure to get every last morsel of the sparse cornmeal. He definitely preferred the hospitality of the Zetas’ city branch. The food was a hell of a lot better, and there had been more of it. With these rations, no wonder Calderon was a sack of bones.
Calderon had already finished and was carefully rinsing his plate and spoon. They were only allotted two small water bottles apiece per day, so every drop was precious. Suddenly one of the guards appeared outside their pen.
“Venga conmigo,” he said, gesturing toward Calderon.
Calderon stood, his expression tough to read.
“What do you think they want?” Flores asked.
“Tough to say. Proof of life, possibly? This might be the beginning of negotiations.” Calderon smiled thinly. “Hopefully I will return with good news for both of us, amigo.”
“Good luck.” Flores shook his hand, then watched as he was led down the aisle.
Next door, Ramon Tejada monitored Calderon’s departure, but he didn’t say anything.
Flores paced as he waited. He’d already quietly begun planning their escape, familiarizing himself with the guards’ shifts, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the camp from what he could observe from their cell. That morning Calderon had mentioned that periodically army helicopters skirted low overhead. It was the only time the guards seemed distracted, he claimed. Perhaps enough to mask their escape, if they timed it right.
But what if they were actually moving him to a different pen? If Calderon didn’t come back, Flores would be forced to leave without him. Anything else was too risky. Not a decision he relished making.
A siren blared, and there was a commotion at the end of their row. A line of guards appeared. In ragged formation they trotted forward, each breaking off to stand in front of a different pen. One stopped directly across from Flores. The guard raised his rifle to his shoulder and aimed for his chest.
Flores’s heart nearly stopped. His mind raced as his field of vision narrowed to the guard’s finger, watching pressure increase on the trigger. He’d never know his child. His body would likely never be found. Maryanne would have no idea what had really happened to him. He wasn’t going to get a chance to say goodbye.
“Tranquilo, amigo,” Ramon muttered in the next pen. “It’s a drill.”
“What?” Flores examined the guard facing him. The man had frozen, as if awaiting an order.
“They do this a few times a week. It’s to prepare the guards, in case the camp is ever invaded. They’re to make sure none of the prisoners survive.” Tejada’s words dissolved into another coughing fit.
“So how do we this isn’t going to be the time they shoot us?”
“We don’t.”
Flores shifted his head. Tejada hadn’t moved at the guard’s approach. He remained seated near the door, face tilted up to catch the thin ray of light that sliced across his cell.
The siren issued a staggered series of bleats, and the guard outside Flores’s pen lowered his weapon. A moment later, he trotted back toward the end of the row, falling in line with the other guards.
Flores breathed out hard and wiped a line of sweat from his brow. He resolved to be long gone before the next drill.
More coughing from next door. Flores turned to see Tejada bent double, hacking into a soiled handkerchief. “Cómo estás?” Flores asked.
Tejada waved a hand. After a moment, the fit passed. He took a sip of water, then collapsed on a pile of matted leaves. Despite his condition, he produced a cigarette from the pocket of his shirt and lit it. Lying on his back he nursed it, a thin trail of smoke rising like a wraith above his head. “This place is hell,” Tejada said after a moment. He shifted to squint at Flores. “And you’re living with the devil.”
Before Flores could ask what he meant, Calderon reappeared, the guard shoving him from behind. The door swung open and he stepped back inside. Calderon looked shaken, face pale, hands trembling.
“What happened?” Flores asked. “Did they take a proof-of-life photo?”
Calderon sank into a crouch, clutching his knees to his chest. “No, my friend,” he said in a voice barely above a whisper. “They wanted something else.”
“What?”
Calderon didn’t reply. Flores figured he was waiting for the guard to leave, but the door to their pen hadn’t been closed yet.
“Venga conmigo.”
Flores turned to find the guard pointing at him.
