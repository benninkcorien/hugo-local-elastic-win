“That how you got so messed up?” He waved a finger in a circle, taking in her appearance. Kelly realized how she must look: beaten, bruised and reeking of garbage. No wonder Rodriguez was sticking to the far side of the cell.
“There was a lead in one of those files you gave me that claimed he was living down here. By the time I found him in the dump, he’d already killed the kid. But he’s still out there, Danny.”
His eyebrows shot up—she never called him by his first name. “First things first,” he said after a second. “Let’s get you out of here.”
“You need to call it in. I can work with a forensic artist—he’s modified his appearance slightly. His hair is short now, and he’s clean-shaven—”
“Jones, relax. We gotta make sure you don’t end up a permanent resident of the Mexican prison system, then we can deal with other matters.”
Kelly could tell by the way he said it that he didn’t believe her. “I saw him, Danny. He’s here.”
Rodriguez didn’t respond. He walked out of the cell and spoke to the guard in a low voice. The guard nodded once, then started to slide the door shut.
“Wait!” Kelly cried, lurching toward the door. A wave of panic washed over her as it closed.
Rodriguez held up both hands placatingly. “It’s okay, Kelly. Trust me, I’ll have you out of here as soon as I can.”
The click of the latch seemed to resonate. As their footsteps faded down the hall, Kelly sank back down on the cot. For some reason, now she felt even more alone.
Mark clicked off the radio with a frown. They were still hunkered down in the knoll. Brown wanted the deal sealed before taking them back to the main group.
“What?” Brown asked.
“Syd said yes. And there’s
“Christ, seems like there’s always another thing,” Decker grumbled.
Brown waved a hand impatiently to silence him. “What?”
Mark was still turning the information over in his head. It didn’t sound like Syd believed Isabela, but forced to choose between the two of them, he leaned toward trusting Isabela. He knew those CIA types. Syd seemed capable enough, but her lack of faith in intel she hadn’t personally confirmed was hardly surprising. “We’ve got this girl with us whose father is being held down there. She claims that a rival cartel is planning to move on the camp tonight.”
“Which cartel?”
“The Sinaloans.”
Brown bellowed a deep laugh. “Well, there goes our inside information.”
“So it’s true?”
Brown grinned. “I got a Sinaloa goon back at our staging area who told us the same thing.”
“That’s how we found the camp,” Delano chimed in.
“Yeah?” Mark rubbed his chin. “Two separate sources. I wonder if your guy knows what time the raid is supposed to go down?”
“We’ll see. And since we’re buddies again—” Brown’s grin widened “—I’ll give you first crack at him.”
Flores shifted in his chair. The general glared at him contemptuously. “I’m disappointed in you, Señor Flores. I thought we had a deal.”
“I figured you’d call Calderon out. Did you hear he wanted to talk to you?”
“Sí.” Gente’s hands tapped together in front of his mouth. He had the swollen, dimpled knuckles of a child. “I have nothing left to say to Señor Calderon. You were supposed to do the talking for me.”
“Oh,” Flores said, subdued. So it looked like that part of their plan was a dud. Now that Calderon had finally caved, it was funny that Gente wasn’t jumping at the chance to strike a deal. Didn’t make a hell of a lot of sense. But then, nothing about this made sense anymore.
“He told you he was innocent.” Gente leaned back, causing the chair to groan woefully. “And you believed him.”
“I can’t figure out why else you’d keep him alive,” Flores said. “His story made more sense than yours.”
“And what was his story?” Gente’s lips kept tugging up at the corners, as if he wanted desperately to smile but the weight of his cheeks prevented it.
“That you wanted him to strike a deal releasing client lists, and he refused. That’s why you wanted me to kill him.”
“He refused?” Gente cocked an eyebrow.
“That’s what he said.”
“I understand, señor. After all, he your employer. And you’re right, we have kept him alive. But then, he still has some powerful friends in the government here. If we killed him, it would send the message that no one is safe.”
“I’d think you’d want that. Make them scared of you.”
“Not really.” Gente rocked slightly. “A certain level of government assistance is necessary to keep our operations flowing smoothly. If they saw us as a threat, they might take actions that wouldn’t benefit us. That is why you—” Gente jabbed at the table with a meaty index finger “—must kill him.”
“And if I say no?”
Gente regarded him in silence for a moment. “Part of me admires your blind loyalty, even to a man as undeserving as Cesar Calderon.” He practically spat the name. “If he is not dead by tomorrow morning, then both of you will be shot during an escape attempt. This is a gift I’m giving you, soldier,” he said. “I could easily stage such a thing and guarantee your deaths. But I would prefer that you live. You remind me of myself at your age.”
Flores swallowed a slew of retorts to that comparison. “I’d do better with a gun.”
“I’m sure you would.” Gente laughed out loud. “And I’d bet you’d take a few of my men with you.”
“Give me another chance.” Flores tried to sound earnest as he said, “I’ll do it tonight.”
“How will you do it?”
“I’ll put a pillow over his head so I don’t have to see his eyes when I drive the knife through it.”
The response seemed to satisfy the general. “Very well. But if Calderon sees another dawn, I will have you both killed. And it will not be quick or painless.”
