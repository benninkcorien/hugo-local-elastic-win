Twenty-Three  
Twenty-Three
Jake clenched his jaw as Syd wove through traffic. They’d turned off the main highway onto a smaller two-lane road. Apparently Syd regarded the double-line separating them from oncoming cars as more of a friendly guideline than a mandate. Jake instinctively braced himself against the dashboard as she swerved blindly around a truck, skidding into the breakdown lane as a sedan bore down on them. Seemingly unperturbed, she jetted back across both lanes, ignoring the protesting bleats of multiple horns.
“Be nice to get there in one piece,” Jake said tightly.
“CIA driver training. Best in the world,” Syd replied, shooting him a look.
“I’m willing to bet your insurance company doesn’t agree,” Jake said.
“Relax. We’re almost there.” Syd glanced at the GPS then hit the gas, taking a curve at seventy miles per hour.
Ten minutes later they were a mile from the farmhouse. Syd slowed. An acrid smell seeped through the car vents.
“Maybe someone’s burning trash,” Jake said. Syd didn’t respond, steering onto an unpaved access road. The car bounced over sinkholes, tires kicking up gravel behind them. The smell of smoke was unmistakable now. Light glinted off a large object up ahead. When they got closer, Jake recognized it: the team’s white van. The front was crushed, bumper wrapped around a fence post, windshield shattered. A thin trail of smoke wound out the window, curling and rotating as it ascended.
Syd stopped the car fifty feet away. Jake drew his gun and got out, staying low as he jogged forward. Syd darted ahead of him. They slowed as they approached. The stench here was terrible, sharp and tangy, burnt upholstery mixed with something else.
Jake checked the interior, popping his head up quickly: empty. He sidled around to the driver’s side and yanked the door handle, letting it swing wide while he stayed out of range. He counted to three, then ducked his head inside. Someone had torched the interior. Broken glass on the passenger side, and the seat was smoldering. Jake winced at the smell.
“They used a Molotov cocktail to force them out of the van,” Syd said. She walked further down the road, panning her eyes across the ground. “Skid marks and bullet casings. Looks like we missed the party.”
“So you think they got them?”
“One of them at least,” Syd replied. She was about fifteen feet away, standing beside a pile of brush. Jake trotted over to join her. One of the team members lay on top of a patch of rotting leaves. Half of his face was scorched, the rest of him unrecognizable. An assault rifle was still clenched in his hands.
“Burned alive,” Jake said. “Jesus.”
“He took a couple with him,” Syd said softly. “Good man.”
Jake followed her gaze. Ten yards down the road two bodies lay facedown, sprawled where they had fallen. He approached carefully, keeping an eye on their hands. When he got closer he saw the sticky pools of muddy blood surrounding them, their leather jackets riddled with bullet wounds. Just past them, two motorcycles lay on their sides at angles to each other.
“So where’s the rest of the team?” he asked, glancing around. The surrounding countryside was eerily still. The sting of something burning still irritated his nostrils.
“Let’s get to the house,” Syd said briskly, turning to walk back toward the car. Halfway there she froze. “Hear that?”
Jake listened hard. “Thunder?”
Syd had already bolted for the car, barely waiting for Jake to dive into the passenger seat before gunning the engine.
“We can’t rush in there without a plan,” Jake said as she tore down the road.
“We don’t have time for one. We’re probably already too late.”
Jake opened his mouth to argue, then froze as they rounded a bend. At a break in the barbed wire fence lining the access road, a narrow driveway led through a grove of trees. The driveway dead-ended at a building awash in a flame, consumed by a pulsing heat that produced the roaring noise they’d heard.
“Oh my God,” Jake said. “Please don’t let them be in there.”
Around noon the tension in the house ticked up. The commando-boys were antsy, they kept rechecking things they’d examined a minute before. One of them paced until his buddy glared at him, raising an eyebrow in their direction. Then he sat down, knees jiggling. Madison wanted to scream. They were sitting here waiting to get attacked.
“Why don’t we just leave?” Madison asked again. Her mother shot her a look. She ignored it. “This is nuts. If you only saw two of them, we could get in the van and drive away.”
“They’ll follow us. We’re in a defensible position here,” Maltz said. “On the road we’re vulnerable.”
“So we drive to the police station, tell them what’s going on. They’re probably looking for us now anyway, right?” Madison looked at each of them in turn. “They’ll keep us safe.”
“We’re not sure we can trust them,” Maltz explained after a long pause.
“The police? Are you insane? Mom, tell them.” Madison crossed her arms in front of her chest and turned to her mother.
“Honey, these men seem to know what they’re doing,” Audrey said, though she sounded uncertain as she eyed the guy cleaning his gun for the umpteenth time. “I think we should trust them.”
Madison snorted, grabbed her crutches and clomped into the bedroom. Bree was sitting on the bed, balancing a notebook on her knees as she scribbled. She looked at Madison but didn’t say anything.
“What?” Madison said. “This is not my fault.”
“I never said it was.” Bree seemed preternaturally calm. “It’s got something to do with Dad.”
“I know,” Madison huffed. She dropped onto the other bed and let her crutches clatter to the floor. “Why is Mom trusting these guys?”
Bree turned her attention back to whatever she was writing. She’d kept a diary for years, always hidden as if it held state secrets or something. But once they moved into the apartment and had to share a room, it was easy for Madison to find. The contents were disappointing, though-lots of stuff about boys and what Bree and her friends did every day. “These guys saved you, right? They have some experience with this stuff. We don’t,” Bree said with finality.
But Madison was tired of everyone acting like they knew better than her. She was the one who had been kidnapped and held for days. She knew what they were capable of. At the memory her hand automatically reached for her chest, and she swallowed hard to keep from crying. She kept her voice low, leaning forward as she said, “Yeah, but if they’re only in it for the money, maybe the people who took me will offer them more. Dad’s not rich. What’s to stop them from handing us over?”
“It’s not like that.” Bree shook her head impatiently, as if Madison had said something ridiculous. Her short hair bobbed before settling back into place. “The woman in charge, the one from the hospital? She has a personal interest.”
She said the word personal like it was something dirty. Madison ’s eyes narrowed. “Why would she have a personal interest in us?”
“Because she’s dating Dad,” Bree said without meeting her eyes.
Madison felt as though she’d been punched. Sure, her parents were divorced, but the thought of her dad with another woman was still awful to contemplate. She tried to remember her, could only recall a pretty but tough-looking blonde. She wished she’d paid more attention.
There was a noise in the distance, a rumbling like thunder. Bree sat up straight, eyes wide. Madison froze, pulse pounding in her throat.
“What is that?” she asked.
The door to the room flew open. Maltz was wearing a bulletproof vest and had a rifle slung across his back. “It’s time,” he said.
“Time for what?” Bree sounded scared. Madison started to hyperventilate, picturing herself back in that room, the man coming for her…
“Put these on.” He tossed a couple vests into the room. Bree bent to pick them up and handed one to Madison. It was heavy, and Madison struggled to pull it over her head. She fastened the Velcro as tightly as it would go, but it was too big for her and stuck out on either side like wings. Bree’s was similarly large and hung past her waist. We look like kids playing dress-up, Madison thought. Maltz examined them critically. “They’ll do. C’mon, we gotta be ready.”
Ready for what? Madison wanted to ask, but she was too frightened to speak.
Bree handed Madison the crutches and followed her into the main room, keeping one hand on her elbow. Their mother was sitting there, also looking ridiculous in a vest. Her eyes were wide, and seeing how frightened she was made it so much worse. The roaring had grown louder, it sounded like a swarm had surrounded the house. Motorcycles, Madison thought. They were in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, and it sounded like a hundred motorcycles were circling them.
One of the men peered through a narrow crack in the boards nailed over the windows. “I’m counting at least eight.”
Maltz swore under his breath. “Assessment?” he barked.
“Looks like a gang. I see a few shotguns, some handguns. No carbines or semiautos. Firepower, but nothing too heavy.”
“Okay. With any luck, we’re dealing with amateurs.” Maltz turned to them. “Here’s the deal. Dangel is going to drive the van away, drawing them off. We’re going to head out the back and go cross-country. There’s a river at the property line, then another few miles to the next house. If they tail us, we’ll engage, but I’m hoping it won’t come to that.”
“That’s it? That’s your plan?” Madison asked, incredulous. “How the hell am I supposed to run through the woods? In case you haven’t noticed, I’m in a cast.”
“I’ll be carrying you, miss,” Maltz said.
“Oh my God.” Madison turned to her mother. “Mom, don’t tell me you’re agreeing to this?”
Her mother continued staring at the floor.
“Any questions?” Maltz asked.
Bree stepped forward, voice strong as she said, “We’re ready.”
A minute later, something thumped against the far wall, glass shattering. Smoke drifted into the room. Her mother screamed. Maltz froze for a second, then nodded at Dangel, who jumped into the back of the van and climbed through to the front seat. A second later he revved the engine. As the van tore away from the house, Maltz slammed the front door.
“Everyone to the back,” he ordered.
Madison clomped through the kitchen to the back door. Her mother and sister were already huddled there, eyes wide with fear. The other two men stood on either side of them. Their jaws were tight, and they avoided her eyes. Maltz appeared a second later. They all waited. Another thump, near the bedrooms. A wisp of smoke curled into the room, dancing up toward the ceiling.
“We’re going to be burned alive,” her mother said, voice strangely calm.
“Not if I can help it, ma’am.” Maltz seemed to be waiting for something. One more smack against the wall by the kitchen, then the sound of motors retreating into the distance.
“They’re leaving,” Bree said.
Maltz motioned for them to step aside. He opened the rear door a crack and thrust his head out quickly, scanning from side to side. Seemingly satisfied, he slipped outside.
“What do we do?” Bree asked. One of the men frowned and motioned for her to be silent. A second later, the door swung wide and Maltz reappeared.
“It’s time. Go, go, go!” he said.
One of the commandos raced out. Bree and her mother followed on his heels, Audrey tripping on the threshold. The other commando caught her and helped her to her feet. Madison was suddenly airborne.
“Hey!”
Her crutches fell to the ground with a clatter. Maltz had thrown her over his shoulder. He dashed off into the woods. Madison gritted her teeth, bumping against his back as he ran. She lifted her head. Flames were licking at the farmhouse, a line of them along the base. They climbed steadily as if alive, racing up toward the roof. She heard more glass shattering, then they dipped into a gulch and the house vanished from view.
