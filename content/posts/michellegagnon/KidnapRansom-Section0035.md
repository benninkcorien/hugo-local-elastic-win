Thirty-Six
“You’re sure about this?” Rodriguez asked as he finished attaching the blasting cap to a small wad of C4. They’d decided to err on the side of caution, concerned about a cave-in.
“I’m sure,” Kelly said, although that was the last thing she felt. The very sight of the C4 had opened a hole in her stomach, memories of hurtling through the air, pain everywhere as fireerupted around her. But if she was going to die, perhaps it was only fitting that this time she set the bomb. “Do you know what you’re doing?”
Rodriguez shrugged. “We got a little bit of explosives training in basic. I’m no demolitions expert, but C4 doesn’t exactly require a college degree.” He pushed the putty into a small fissure in the wall, then stepped back and crossed himself. “My mother will never forgive me,” he muttered as he backed away.
They withdrew into the tunnel leading to the chamber. Rodriguez hesitated, holding the detonator.
“What?” Kelly asked.
“I was just thinking, there has to be another way. Stefan got through there somehow.”
“If there is, we don’t have time to find it,” Kelly said firmly. “He might have stashed another victim back there.”
“Okay. But if we die, I’m holding you personally responsible.” Rodriguez nodded, and Kelly plugged her ears. He pushed the detonator button.
The resulting explosion was smaller than she’d expected. A cloud of smoke and dust rolled out of the chamber, making her cough. Kelly waved a hand in front of her face to clear the air. Her head pounded, ears smarting from the concussion.
“How long do you think we have until that brings someone running?” Rodriguez asked.
Kelly didn’t intend to stick around to find out. She edged back into the chamber. The dust was slowly settling. A gaping hole punched through the mural, about two feet high and a foot wide. Rubble dotted the floor surrounding it.
“Another blow to Aztec civilization,” Rodriguez muttered.
Kelly stuck her head through the hole. The air on the other side was cooler and laden with condensation. There was an odd smell, metallic and musty at the same time. “Can you get my flashlight out of the pack?”
He handed it to her, and she turned it on. Past the wall was another tunnel, similar to the one they’d entered the chamber through, but slick with water. She panned the light along the sides, then probed the depths. The light vanished into the darkness. Stefan was nowhere in sight.
“He probably heard the explosion, so we’ll have to be careful,” Kelly said. Rodriguez handed her the backpack, and she dropped it through the hole. She pushed her shoulders through, wiggling awkwardly as she dragged her legs behind her. Rodriguez pressed on her good ankle and she fell through, catching herself with her hands as she dropped to the floor. After considerable grunting, Rodriguez followed. They both stood.
“Dios mío,” Rodriguez said. “How did they not know this was here?”
Kelly didn’t have time to wonder about that. Stepping carefully, she made her way down the tunnel. It reminded her of the passages where she’d first pursued Stefan. But those tunnels were beneath a college campus, in existence for a few hundred years at the most. This was clearly much, much older. More murals lined the walls. Rivulets of water coursed down them, making the images appear to weep. Up ahead, she detected a distinct noise. “Is that water? It sounds li
“A river.” Rodriguez panned his flashlight down. The tunnel floor descended at a steady angle, almost like a ramp. And at the bottom, water lapped at the stone.
Kelly descended the ramp slowly, struggling to keep her footing on the slick surface. “It is a river,” she said, astonished, when she reached the bottom.
The tunnel ended abruptly and the ceiling shot up almost thirty feet. The walls were painted with more murals streaked green and brown from condensation. The air hung heavy with mist. The ramp Kelly was on turned into steps that descended into the water. It was impossible to tell how deep the river was, but it rushed past at a steady clip, vanishing into a hole in the wall on her right.
Rodriguez panned his light across the chamber. “Great, an underground river. Just what I was hoping for. I don’t see any boats.”
“I think we’ll have to swim.” Kelly was already briskly stripping off her pack.
Rodriguez rubbed his chin with one hand. “One problem with that, Jones. I’m not exactly a great swimmer.”
“You can’t swim?”
“I grew up in the barrio. Swimming lessons weren’t an option.”
“That’s okay. You stay here, I’ll go check it out.” Kelly tucked her Glock inside the backpack and raised it above her head. Getting wet shouldn’t prevent the Glock from firing, but if possible she’d prefer not to test that theory.
Rodriguez started to follow suit.
“What are you doing?”
“Coming with you.”
“That’s ridiculous,” she said. “If you can’t swim, you can’t swim.”
“I can’t let you do this alone. Hell, we’ve come all this way.” Rodriguez grimly unlaced his shoes.
“We don’t even know how far this goes,” Kelly argued.
Rodriguez paused. “You just reminded me of something else on that show.”
“What?”
“These tunnels they found in Guatemala. Apparently they went underground for nearly 800 kilometers, across almost the entire country.”
“See?” Kelly said. “No way you’re swimming that far. And if you start to drown, I might not be able to save you. I don’t float that well myself these days,” she said ruefully, glancing at her foot.
Rodriguez still held his shoe. Kelly could see him deliberating. “Look,” she said. “Get to the U.S. Embassy, see if there’s someone there who can help.” She glanced at her watch. “It’s nearly dawn. Pretty soon someone’s bound to discover the new hole we made. It would be better if you weren’t around when that happens.”
“True,” Rodriguez said. “But what if this does stay underground for miles? I don’t want to lose a partner to hypother
“I’ll be fine. I’ve done almost nothing but swim for months now.”
“We could go to the embassy together, scare up some reinforcements.”
“Stefan came down here for a reason. I promise, if I find him, I’ll just monitor him until you get back. But this river might come out somewhere else in the city, and I don’t want to risk losing him again. Try to find a boat so you can catch up.” Kelly slipped into the water. It was chillier than she’d expected. Her teeth immediately started to chatter. She held the backpack high above her head until the water reached her waist. Taking a deep breath, Kelly lay down, wincing at the shock of cold against her skin. She held the backpack up with both hands, bracing the flashlight alongside it to illuminate the hole in the wall. Kelly stretched her legs out in front of her, pointed downstream. As she floated away, she waved one hand back at Rodriguez.
“Damn it, Jones,” he said with resignation. “Don’t get yourself killed.”
She chose not to reply.
Jake held Mark’s hand. The medic hovered over him, injecting medication into his IV line, eyes continually checking the portable monitor beside the gurney.
Garcia appeared stable. The tourniquet had staunched the flow of blood from his leg, and his color was slowly returning.
“How’s Mark doing?” Jake finally asked.
The medic either didn’t speak English, or thought it best not to answer.
The chopper suddenly banked sharply. Out the cockpit window, a stream of lights appeared. They had to be close, Jake gathered, they’d been flying for nearly an hour.
Suddenly, the monitor started flashing. Mark’s body jerked uncontrollably.
“What’s happening?” Jake asked, panicked.
The medic shoved Jake aside as he fumbled through his medical kit. “Seizure.”
Jake could only watch powerlessly as Mark twitched and contorted. The medic dug out a portable oxygen mask and set it over Mark’s mouth. The monitor bleated once, then settled into a steady monotone drone.
Mark fell still.
“We must…” The medic squeezed the bulb of the oxygen bag, then motioned for Jake to take it. Jake tried to recall his CPR training as he watched Mark’s chest rise and fall. The medic nodded his approval, and Jake squeezed again. The defibrillator machine whined as it charged. Three beeps indicated it was ready.
“Hands, please,” the medic said, pushing the oxygen bag away. He attached one electrode to Mark’s shoulder, then yanked up the bottom of his shirt to attach the other to his lower left abdomen. He pressed the button. Mark’s body contracted once, hard, in response to the electric current. They both watched the monitor. It didn’t change.
The medic nodded for him to squeeze the airbag again. Jake pumped twice, then pulled it away.
The helicopter continued to bank. Through the cockpit window, Jake saw thetline of a building rushing up to meet them through the smog. The medic pressed the button again: Mark’s body jumped. The monitor continued to drone.
As the helicopter righted itself and started to descend, Jake began praying.
