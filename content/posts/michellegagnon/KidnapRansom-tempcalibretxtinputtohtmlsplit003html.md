Flores dug the flash drive out of his pocket and stuck it in the USB port. Before he clicked on it, he paused. “You might not want to hear this,” he warned Decker.
“That’s like waving a red flag in front of a bull,” Decker snorted. “Play it.”
After another second of hesitation, Flores opened the file.
“I was just starting to panic,” Smiley called over the sound of the shower. “There’s a board meeting scheduled this Friday.”
“Don’t worry, Linus. We’ll be ready for them.”
“I hope so. They’ll have some tough questions. I was thinking that in light of everything that’s happened, some restructuring might be in order.”
Calderon shut off the tap. The water had been lukewarm, but after months without bathing, it had felt as luxurious as a Roman bath. “What kind of restructuring?”
“It was a bitch finding you, Cesar. And damned if anyone in the government down here had a clue. I couldn’t even figure out who to call. It occurred to me that maybe we should have more cross-departmental involvement. Make sure the Central America guys know something about what’s going on in the East Asia department. That sort of thing.”
Calderon repressed a flash of irritation as he dried off. “I’m too tired to discuss business, Linus.”
“Of course. Maybe on the flight home. I chartered a plane, once the rest of the team gets back we can—”
“I’m anxious to get home.” Calderon appeared in the doorway. Linus’s clothes were almost comically small on him. He rubbed his hair with a towel as he continued. “By now Brown has everything well in hand. They can follow us on another flight tomorrow. I expect to leave in five minutes.”
“Yes, sir,” Smiley said, chastened. His neck flushed red as he moved about the room gathering up his things.
A knock at the door, then Decker opened it. “We’re gonna grab some chow down the street.”
“Actually we’re leaving in a few—”
“All due respect, sir, it’s been days since I had a decent meal. And the airport is five hours away, easy. I ll my gut to make that drive.”
“Very well,” Calderon said, peeved. “But make it quick.”
“Can’t leave you alone, sir, not with Zetas still running around out there. You’d best come along.”
Calderon was about to argue, then thought better of it. “I could use a good meal,” he said. “Linus?”
“Of course.”
The three of them headed out into the night. After a second, the truck door closed and Flores fell in step with them.
“Be good to have a hot meal, eh, amigo?” Calderon said. “Not like last night.”
Flores didn’t answer.
The other motels flanking the narrow road were dark, their neon signs still. Without them on, the surrounding jungle seemed closer, as though it was on the verge of opening a dark mouth and swallowing them whole. Smiley cleared his throat. “Must be the off season,” he said.
“Mexico’s too dangerous for tourists these days. Hell, you could even get kidnapped,” Decker joked.
Flores laughed sharply. They continued in silence, until Calderon said, “What was your name again, soldier?”
“Decker. Rodney Decker.”
“I’ll make sure you get a promotion when we get back to headquarters, Rodney.” Calderon scratched his neck. “Funny, the bug bites feel worse after a shower than they did before. What I’d do for some Calamine.”
“We might be able to get some at the airport,” Smiley said.
Calderon took in their surroundings. “This is almost as remote as the camp.” He shook his head. A few hours ago, his sole priority had been staying alive. Now he was already burdened by the thought of meetings, conference calls and the myriad responsibilities awaiting him. In an odd way, his captivity had provided a respite from all that.
“What’s so funny?” Decker demanded.
“Oh, nothing. I just have a lot to do when I get home.” Calderon waved a hand dismissively.
“Yeah, I’ll bet.” Decker examined him. “When they asked you to cut a deal and sell out clients, you said no, right?”
“Please,” Smiley snorted. “That’s really—”
Calderon looked Decker dead in the eye. “Of course I said no. That’s why they kept me so long without demanding a ransom.”
“Huh.” Decker dropped his gaze back to the road. It was becoming increasingly overgrown the farther they went from the motel.
A ribbon of fear spiraled up Calderon’s spine. He was a good liar, renowned for spouting convincing fallacies during a hostage negotiation. But he got the sense that the man beside him wasn’t falling for the act.
“Last case I worked for you was a tough one. Little girl got snatched and killed,” Decker finally said. “Jennifer Esp”
Decker nodded. “I was the first one in the room, right after they pulled the trigger. We killed the bastards, but still…” He shook his head. “It got to me, you know? Pretty little girl. Shouldn’t have died that way.”
“Yes, well. It’s a dangerous country,” Smiley said.
“Her father was a client?” Flores interjected. He’d slipped behind them.
“The company he worked for was.” Calderon cleared his throat. “How much farther is this place? Perhaps there’s some food back at the motel. Then we could just get on the road.”
“Here’s the thing I don’t get,” Decker said, ignoring the question. “I talked to the girl’s bodyguard, and he said the reason the Zetas took them by surprise was that somehow they had the alarm code. How do you figure they got that?”
“Alarm company, maybe? I honestly don’t know.”
Decker shook his head. “Nope. It was a rotating code. He said the only people who knew it were the Espositos, him and one other guy. Tyr set it up. And the bodyguards seemed straight to me.”
“What are you insinuating?” Linus asked sharply.
“Nothing.” Decker jerked his head toward a dirt trail leading away from the main road. “It’s that way.”
Calderon was hyperconscious of Decker and Flores behind him as they followed the trail. The trees reached together overhead, forming a dark canopy.
Linus suddenly exclaimed and staggered back. “Oh my God!”
“What?” Calderon edged past him. They were on the overhang of a cliff. Past the lip of it he caught a glimpse of sky, stars fading into the horizon. He sighed. No wonder these idiots had gotten caught by the Zetas. No sense of direction. “We’ve come the wrong way.”
“Looks right to me,” Decker said.
Calderon felt a jab in his back, pressing him forward. “What are you doing?”
“Gente taped your conversations. We heard the deal you made.” Flores’s voice seethed with rage. “You lied to me.”
“What?” Smiley protested. “That’s insane. Cesar would never—”
“A lot of men risked their lives coming down here after you.” Decker stepped forward. “And a lot of them died.”
Smiley held up his hands. “Let’s all just take a minute. Those tapes can be manipulated—”
“Is that what happened?” Flores demanded. “They fixed the tapes? And the codes? The blueprints?”
“Cesar…” Smiley turned to face him, doubt in his eyes. “It’s not true, is it?”
Calderon considered proclaiming his innocence, but clearly somehow they’d stumbled across proof. At this point, his best bet was damage control. “In the end, we saved lives. Most of our clients secured release in a few week some a bit longer. That was the beauty of it. They all survived. It’s rare we can say that in this business.”
“Oh my God.” Smiley appeared horrified.
“Don’t judge me, Linus. You know the pressure we were under. The board demanded that we improve the bottom line. And this arrangement worked.”
“I had no idea.” Smiley turned back to Flores and Decker. “Please, you have to believe I didn’t know.”
“So why’d they take you?” Decker asked.
“I terminated the agreement.”
“I don’t get why they didn’t kill you,” Flores said. “I sure as hell would have.”
“Initially Gente thought there was a chance of reestablishing the status quo,” Calderon said. He was suddenly exhausted, as if he’d run a marathon. My God, the havoc he’d wreaked. All for a bit of guaranteed glory and a larger bonus. And now he’d trade everything for his life.
“And you said no? Bullshit,” Flores spat.
“It’s true. I don’t expect you to believe me, but it is. The Esposito case was the final straw. She was just eleven years old.” Calderon’s heart seized at the memory. “They were supposed to take her father, but he wasn’t home when the team went in. He’d woken up with a toothache and booked an emergency appointment at the dentist. So they grabbed his daughter instead. I initially decided on a compact with the Zetas because they were professionals. Lately, however, they were allowing amateurs into their ranks. Anyway, the company’s insurance didn’t cover Jennifer, so the ransom demand couldn’t be met.”
“And you let her die?”
“No, I tried to save her.” Calderon turned to Decker. “I sent in your team. I even offered my own money. The general didn’t care. Once he realized she wasn’t insured, he killed her, partly to cover up the mistake his men had made. That’s when I told him I was done.”
“That sounds like a load of crap,” Decker noted.
“Well, that’s what happened,” Calderon said. “You want to kill me, fine. But you’ve got a pregnant wife, amigo—”
“I’m not your amigo,” Flores growled.
“And Decker, I could make you a full partner in the firm. No more going out in the field unless you want to.”
“I feel sick.” Smiley had gone pale. “All these years we’ve worked together, Cesar. I thought I knew you.”
“Shut up, Linus,” Calderon snarled. He turned back to Flores and Decker. “We’ll start off with a six-figure bonus. What do you say?”
Flores and Decker exchanged a look.
“That’s a lot of money.” Decker scratched his chin thoughtfully. “Hell, I’ve never even seen that much money.”
“He did save my life,” ted out.
“Still, there’s Kaplan.”
“And Monroe, Black…hell, a lot of guys died for this sorry bastard.”
“Don’t be foolish, gentlemen.” Calderon’s eyes narrowed. “If this comes out, Tyr will cease to exist. You won’t have jobs at all. There’s only one smart choice here.”
“He does have a point,” Decker said.
“Yup. What do you think, Decker? You feeling smart today?”
Decker eyed Calderon thoughtfully. Smiley had wrapped his arms around himself and was rocking back and forth. The wind picked up around them, a few raindrops started to fall.
“Probably start pouring in a minute.” Flores glanced up at the sky. “We should be getting back.”
“So we have a deal?” Calderon asked hopefully.
The shove took him by surprise. The ground beneath his feet suddenly disappeared. “Wait! You work for me!”
Calderon’s fingers clawed at the air as he tumbled down, legs working as if he were attempting to swim back up. His body hurtled end over end. The last thing he saw was the branches of a tree reaching up to embrace him.
Decker peered over the cliff edge. Calderon’s body had come to rest in the uppermost branches of a giant ceiba. It swayed slightly, then stilled. “Guess I’m still a dumb shit,” he said, turning back to Flores.
“Guess so.”
“Still hungry?”
“Starving.”
They started to walk back toward the road.
Linus Smiley had dropped to his knees, hands covering his head. Hesitantly he called after them, “What about me?”
“What about you?” Decker yelled back. “You want to follow him?”
“No,” Smiley said in a small voice. He cleared his throat. “Aren’t you worried?”
“That you’ll tell?”
Smiley couldn’t see their eyes in the dark. He nodded once.
“You’re not that stupid. See ya.”
As they vanished into the trees, the clouds opened up and a warm rain started to fall.
