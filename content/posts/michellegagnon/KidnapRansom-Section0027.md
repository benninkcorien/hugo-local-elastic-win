Twenty-Eight
Flores was in the back of the pen, working away at the chicken wire with the knife when the firing start initially tried to dig down to where the wire was inserted in the soil, but whoever constructed their cage did an annoyingly good job of it. Two feet down and he’d still encountered nothing but wire mesh. The only way out was to slice through, separating the wires one by one, which was extremely time-consuming. Three hours in, and he’d only managed to separate four wires in a straight line. His hands were a bloody mess from rubbing against the sharp edges.
At the first burst of gunfire, he froze. Was Tyr coming for them? Or had the unit been discovered?
“What’s going on?” he asked. Calderon had the side of his face pressed against the bars, trying to see down the line of cages.
“No sé,” he replied. In the neighboring cage Tejada suddenly started hacking. “Silencio, Ramon!” Calderon snapped.
Tejada’s shoulders shook, but he kept his mouth closed as he coughed.
“Why aren’t they coming?” Calderon sounded puzzled. “In the drills, they always come within a minute or two.”
“Maybe the general isn’t sticking by his word,” Flores said. “Could be he decided to use this as a cover to kill us.”
Calderon snorted. “Don’t kid yourself, amigo. He can shoot us whenever he wants. No, this is something different.”
“Whatever it is, we gotta get a move on.” Determined, Flores went back to the task at hand. A pair of white eyes shone from his left, regarding his handiwork.
“Take me with you,” Tejada begged. “Please, or they will kill me.”
“Absolutamente,” Flores lied. The truth was, he’d be lucky to get himself and Calderon out of here in one piece. He sawed away, and another set of wires split. Flores pried them apart with his fingers, then started on the next one down.
“All right, here it is.” Rodriguez tapped at the keyboard one-handed while holding a taco in the other. A trail of salsa dribbled down his chin.
They were ensconced in a restaurant a few blocks from their hotel in the Chapultepec-Lomas district. The area was decidedly more upscale than the other sections of Mexico City Kelly had seen so far. The few cars passing by at this late hour were mostly foreign-made, Toyotas with a few Lexuses and Mercedes scattered in between. The streets were cleaner, and even the smog seemed less pervasive. In spite of that, Danny had declared three other restaurants too sketchy before settling on this one. Part of a hotel bar, their meal even came complete with a free wireless connection.
“Man, this is good,” Rodriguez said appreciatively, holding back the taco to eye it. “Just like Momma used to make.”
Kelly had only managed a few bites of her enchilada. She was itching to find a lead to pursue, keenly aware of Stefan’s trail fading by the minute. By now, he might even have snatched another victim. “You were saying?” she asked impatiently.
“The guy who wrote the book has a website with more information. Xipe Totec, aka ‘our lord the flayed one,’ was a life-death-rebirth deity. He’s usually represented wearing a flayed human skin. The flayed skins of sacrificed victims were believed to have curative properties when touched. Mothers even took their children to handle such skins in order to relieve their ailments.” Rodriguez made a face and set his half-eaten taco back down on his plate. “So much for dinner.”
“What else does it say?”
“Xipe Totec flayed himself to give food to humanity. It was supposed to be symbolic of the way maize seeds lose their outer layer before germination. After twenty days the priests took off the skins and placed them in caves. Must have been pretty ripe by then.”
“What about the sacrifice, and the pyramid?”
Rodriguez continued as if she hadn’t spoken. “There’s an Aztec calendar here with each deity and what kind of sacrifice they got. To kick off the New Year on February 2, they committed mass drownings. Next month, the flaying, then victims were shot with arrows and had their hearts yanked out while they were still alive…it says here that in 1487, the Aztecs sacrificed eighty thousand prisoners over the course of four days. That’s insane. How was anyone left?”
“The temple, Rodriguez.”
“Right. Okay, sacrifices to Xipe Totec were made during the month of Tlacaxipehualiztli, starting around March 6.” He looked up. “That’s over a month away, so Stefan’s timing was off.”
“Unless he was just practicing,” Kelly said grimly.
Rodriguez shuddered. “Makes me appreciate Catholicism.”
Kelly read over his shoulder. “It says Xipe Totec was associated with the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlán. Where’s that? Is it still around?”
“Holy crap,” Rodriguez said. “Jones, it’s right here. The Aztec city of Tenochtitlán was built on an island in Lake Texcoco, the site of present-day Mexico City.”
Jake smeared some more mud on his face. Under close inspection it would never hold up, but he was hoping that from a few feet away, in the dark, a Zeta guard would be fooled.
“Nice,” Syd said.
“You’re not going to do the same?” he asked, eyeing her.
Aside from tucking her blond hair under a cap and dressing in camo, Syd hadn’t done anything to alter her appearance. “No reason to bother,” she said. “I doubt there are any female guards down there. The Zetas aren’t known for their forward-thinking gender policies. If I get spotted, they’ll shoot me whether I’ve got crap on my face or not.”
She had a point, Jake thought, taking her in. Even in the somewhat loose-fitting camouflage, she was obviously female. “Don’t worry about me, champ. I’ll be fine.” She winked at his look of concern.
As always, Syd was never in a better mood than at the outset of an extraordinarily dangerous operation. Jake wished he could share her enthusiasm. They were about to go up against highly trained mercenaries, while trying to avoid the other aries shooting at everything in sight. They had to penetrate to where the hostages were being held, in the middle of what sounded like the final stand at the Alamo.
And that was the easy part. Somehow, they had to get back out.
Kane and Maltz still hadn’t made it back from town, so they were forced to rely almost exclusively on a bunch of guys from a competing company, who so far hadn’t impressed Jake with their level of skill. All things considered, he would have preferred stepping into an active volcano. The odds of survival were probably roughly the same.
Another rocket flared across the sky above camp. Jake watched its flickering descent. Sputters of automatic gunfire below them, a deafening cacophony that lit up the night like sparklers. The bulk of the fighting was centered on the south side of camp.
Mark came to stand beside them. “We’re infiltrating in teams of three. Brown and his guys are going after Calderon and Flores. Decker and I will cover them, then we’ll try to find Isabela’s father.”
“We never got a lock on his location,” Syd protested.
“I know. But I promised I’d try.”
“Where do you want us?” Jake asked.
Mark turned to look at him. “I’d feel better if you covered us from here.”
“Bullshit,” Syd said.
“Syd, you’re a walking target in there. And Jake, we both know this isn’t your sort of thing.”
“You can’t go in there without someone watching your back,” Jake argued.
“It’s not a put-down. I just don’t think—”
“I can handle myself. And you said you can’t trust these Tyr guys. They might put a bullet in your back just because they can.”
Mark looked ready to argue the point, but he was interrupted by Brown’s voice crackling out of his radio. “In position. We’re a go in two.”
“Roger that. Heading for the east gate.” Mark clicked off. He examined Jake for a long moment before saying, “Fine, you’re on with me and Decker. Syd, hang back with the sniper rifle. We’re going to need a good shot to help us on the way out.”
Syd nodded curtly. Jake was about to walk away when she abruptly threw her arms around him. “Take care of yourself, partner.”
“Always.” He gently eased her off, then followed Mark down toward the camp.
