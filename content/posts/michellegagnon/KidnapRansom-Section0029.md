Thirty
Jake kept to the shadows as he followed Mark and Decker. They were entering the camp through the main gates on the eastern side. A pothole-riddled road wove away from the massive wooden fence, disappearing into the jungle. He glanced up at the guard tower they were skirting, wondering why no one was shooting at them yet.
“They must have pulled everyone south to act as reinforcements,” Mark said, as if reading his mind. “But there are probably still hostiles covering the pens.”
Decker was on point, sweeping the barrel of his LMT from side to side as he moved ahead of them. They slipped inside, initially sticking to the interior wall. The camp was composed of a motley assortment of dwellings, some obviously prefab, others built on-site from raw wood. They passed a long building, probably guard barracks. A light rain started to fall.
“The rain’s good cover,” Decker said in a low voice. “Finally we get a break.”
Jake kept glancing back, braced for someone to start peppering them with rounds. They passed quickly through the section of camp where the guards lived and trained. Decker stopped abruptly, holding up a fist. After waiting a few beats, he charged across an open space, down the long aisle that marked the beginning of the prisoners’ section. A moment later, Jake and Mark followed. They made it across without encountering any guards.
“Hell, this is almost too easy,” Mark murmured.
They approached what looked like an endless row of kennels constructed out of chicken wire. The smell was terrible here, sweat and piss mingled with rotting leaves. As they passed along the row, a chorus of voices kicked up. Stark-white eyes stared out at them, fingers clutching the wires. “Señores!” they cried out. “Por favor!”
“Christ, we might as well have brought a bullhorn,” Decker said, agitated. “They’re gonna bring guards running.”
Jake agreed, but there was no way to silence the prisoners. The noise shot along the line of pens like the wick leading to a bomb, increasing in volume until a single excited proclamation stood out. “Americanos!”
“Calderon and Flores are two rows down,” Mark said. “Brown should be coming up on them.” The plan had been for Brown to enter from the next gate over, the one closest to Calderon’s holding cell. That way if one of their groups attracted fire, it would distract the guards enough to allow the alternate team to slip inside.
Mark was moving faster now. Jake broke into a trot to keep up with him. The radio on Mark’s shoulder suddenly crackled. “This is Alpha team. Hostiles at the North Gate,” Brown said in a low voice.
“Roger,” Mark said. “Beta team clear. We’re almost at the target.”
“Roger that. We’ll double back and come in after you.”
The radio fell silent.
So it’s down to us, Ja thought. They turned the next corner at a dead run. According to their intel, Flores and Calderon were being held a few hundred feet down and to the right.
A sputter of gunfire a few rows over. Someone screamed. A second passed, then more rounds. The scream was abruptly silenced. Mark and Decker slowed. Jake matched their pace.
“Sounds like some of our friends hung around to execute prisoners,” Decker said.
At the sound of the shots, the murmur surrounding them ascended to a fever pitch. Prisoners threw themselves against the wires, clawing at the pen doors in their desperation to escape. Jake gritted his teeth and kept going.
They turned down the last row. Twenty yards away, a guy in fatigues braced an LMT against his shoulder as he aimed into one of the pens.
“Alto!” Mark shouted, sighting his own weapon.
The muzzle of the gun swiveled toward them.
“Get down!” Mark shoved Jake hard. He flew through the air, rolling a few times before slamming against the metal side of a pen.
A sputter of machine-gun fire, and Mark dropped to the ground.
Flores froze, his legs still inside the cage. Every fiber of his being screamed for him to squeeze all the way out and run for his life. But if he did that, Calderon would be killed. And in spite of everything, he didn’t know if he’d be able to live with that.
Of course, chances were the guard would shoot them both anyway.
“Métanse!” the guard yelled, pivoting the gun back and forth between them.
Calderon locked eyes with Flores. His held a look of infinite sadness. “Vaya con Dios, amigo,” he said before turning away.
“Wait,” Flores protested, but Calderon was already walking toward the entrance to the pen. He kept his hands held high, chin jutted up. The guard shifted as if anticipating an attack, although the door remained locked. The barrel of his gun aimed directly at Calderon’s chest. His body shielded Flores, at least for the moment.
Flores channeled the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He dug his elbows into the dirt, clawing his way forward. His hips shifted through the opening. The sheared wires rended his pant legs as he dragged himself out. As his feet cleared the gap, gunfire erupted behind him. Without looking back, he leaped up and ran like hell.
“Mark!” Jake cried out.
Decker was already firing. The guard’s body was buffeted by bullets, making him jump and twitch like a rag doll. His rifle went off in a sputtering arc, bullets ripping into the trees overhead as he toppled over.
Jake crawled to his brother. The impact of the bullet had thrown him on his side. His eyes were closed, and he didn’t appear to be breathing.
Jake’s hands shook as he rolled Mark onto his back. He couldn’t see any blood.
Decker squatted next to him. He reached out a steady hand, feeling for a pulse. Then he shook him.
“Hey!” Jake cried.
Mark suddenly shifted, and his eyes popped open. He looked up blearily.
“What happened?”
“Got your bell rung,” Decker said brusquely. “Looks like your vest stopped it, though.”
Mark lifted his head. There was a quarter-sized hole in the front of his shirt. He stuck a finger in and tapped his vest. “Good thing they weren’t using hollow points,” he said.
“Good thing,” Decker agreed. “Scared the piss out of your brother, though.”
“Yeah?” Mark shifted to look at Jake. “I didn’t think you’d be shedding any tears over me.”
“I just wasn’t in the mood to carry you.” Jake cuffed his shoulder.
“I’d feel the same way.” Mark grinned.
“We better keep moving,” Decker said.
“Sure.” Mark winced as he staggered to his feet, shrugging off help. He looked down the line of pens, getting his bearings. “Should be twelve pens down.”
“Crap,” Decker said. “That’s where the guard was.”
