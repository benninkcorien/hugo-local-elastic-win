Twenty-Nine
“So we just need to find out where that temple used to be located,” Kelly said.
“Maybe.” Rodriguez scrolled through the site. “Although it says similar sacrifices were made in other Aztec cities like Tlatelolco, Xochimilco and Tex
“Stefan was focused on Tenochtitlán,” Kelly said, shaking her head. “That’s why he came here in the first place. Admit it,” she said with a grin. “This feels right to you.”
“You know—” he examined her “—that’s the first time I’ve seen you smile since…well, you know.”
Kelly’s smile vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
“I just meant—”
“It’s okay,” Kelly said quickly. “I know. And I’m really sorry that I missed your wedding. Truly.”
Rodriguez shrugged, but his cheeks were pink. “No problem. It was hectic, anyway—three hundred people screaming at each other in Spanish. You would have been miserable.”
“You kidding? That’s practically my second language now.” Kelly smiled again, and Rodriguez grinned back. “So let’s find out where this temple used to be.”
“That sounds an awful lot like we won’t be sleeping tonight,” Rodriguez grumbled. But he typed some words into the search engine. “Here’s something. ‘An island city, five miles square, Tenochtitlán was surrounded by Lake Texcoco. Three causeways led into the city. Canals were used as streets and people traveled everywhere by canoe. With palaces, gardens, fountains, aqueducts and sewage collection on large barges for use as fertilizer, Tenochtitlán was more advanced than any city in Europe. Looming over it all was a great pyramid with bloodstained temples on top.’”
“Does it say where the pyramid was located?”
“I’m working on it.” He hit a few more keys, and a large topographic map materialized onscreen. “Says here that maps of Tenochtitlán are only accurate to a certain point—most of them come from archaeological exploration and Spanish records. But this is a mock-up of the ancient city.” Kelly leaned in. The map was scrawled on old parchment, squiggly black lines delineating streets and houses. “After the conquest of the Spaniards, the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlán was mostly destroyed. It was located dead center in the city.”
“That sounds easy,” Kelly said.
“Not exactly. We’ve got to find out what the original borders of Tenochtitlán were. If I were back at the office, we could print out an overlay…”
“No time,” Kelly said. “Keep digging.”
Rodriguez blew out hard, making it clear he wasn’t enjoying himself.
“I can take over if you want,” she offered.
“No, it’s fine. Wait…here we go.” Another page popped up. This one had a photograph of an archaeological site.
Kelly read aloud, “‘More than four hundred years later the base of the pyramid was found during rebuilding after major earthquakes. The dig has gone on since 1978. The pyramid ruins lie to one side of the cathedral built by the Spanish next to the Great Marketplace. The site can be visited using a series of overlooks and footpaths.’ This is it, we need to get
“Now?”
Kelly nodded, and his shoulders slumped. Rodriguez scooped up the last of his taco and jammed it in his mouth, chewed three times, then swallowed. “The things I let you talk me into.” He shut the laptop and pushed his chair back. “We’re making a stop first.”
“We don’t have time—” Kelly said impatiently.
“Listen, Jones. I’ve only got my sidearm and ten rounds. And unless I’m mistaken, you’re still unarmed. I’m not going after anyone like that.”
“It’s nearly midnight, how do you expect—”
“You’re forgetting that I’ve got family here, chica.” He winked. “Time to pay a visit to Tío Pablo.”
Beads of sweat ran down Flores’s face, but he persisted. The shots were getting closer. Personally he planned to be long gone by the time the battle arrived. He had assumed that Tyr would stage a late-night snatch and grab, flying under the radar to sneak them out during a shift change. But from the sound of it they’d sent a large enough team for an all-out assault. The company manual never mentioned that type of operation.
The ground shook as a grenade exploded nearby. Screams and cries followed it. Flores gritted his teeth. He could feel Calderon at his shoulder, breathing hard.
“We must hurry, my friend,” Calderon said.
“I’m going as fast as I can,” he snapped.
Next door, aside from occasional coughing fits, Tejada had fallen silent. He sat with his arms wrapped around his knees, rocking back and forth. The motion made the light in their pen shift.
Flores yanked the last two wires apart, pushing them out and away so they would cause the least amount of damage when they crawled through.
“Is that wide enough?” Calderon asked dubiously. The seam in the wires extended from about a foot off the ground to the bottom of the pen. The wires were spread two inches apart, gaping open like an inverted mouth.
“We’re about to find out,” Flores said. He pulled some of the filthy matting they used as bedding over his head to protect it, then carefully pushed through. His head just cleared the space. Flores could feel the upper wires straining, tearing at the bedding. One caught the back of his right hand and he winced. He shifted the hand to free it, then eased his shoulders through. The wires snagged at his clothing, but if there was enough room for his shoulders, the rest of his body would follow.
“You did it, cabrón!” Calderon snarled exuberantly. “Let’s go!”
Flores wiggled forward on his belly, an inch at a time. He was halfway through when there was a commotion at the front of their cage. He froze, shifting his head to see behind him.
One of the Zetas guards had materialized at their door. He was aiming right for them.
