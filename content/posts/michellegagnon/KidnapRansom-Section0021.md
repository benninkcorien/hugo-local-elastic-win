Twenty-Two
“Why do we have to attack tonight?” Syd asked.
“Can I come in?” Isabela stood uncertainly on the threshold. She’d showered and changed into some clothing Maltz had rustled up for her. With her hair down, she was actually quite attractive. No wonder she’d easily managed to enlist Mark’s help.
“Sure.” Jake stepped aside. Isabela entered and looked for a place to sit. She ended up leaning against the wall by the television.
“I called some contacts,” Isabela said.
“Not the Zetas.” Syd’s voice was hard.
“No, of course not. I know some people who work for the Sinaloa Cartel.”
“Isn’t that one of the rival cartels?” Jake asked.
“It’s the rival cartel,” Syd said, eyes narrowing. “The Zetas took over the Gulf Cartel after Osiel Cárdenas was extradited to the U.S. in 2007. They formed a partnership with some former Sinaloa members, the Beltrán-Leyva brothers. Now the two cartels are sworn enemies, responsible for most of the uptick in violence. It’s interesting that you seem to know all these guys.”
“We all grew up together in el Eden,” Isabela said defiantly. “The cartels were the only option for most of the local boys.”
“And you became a pharmacist. Interesting.”
“This information could save Mark’s friends, and my father,” Isabela retorted, chin raised. “You think I would risk his life?”
“It remains to be seen if you even have a father, never mind one in the camp,” Syd said. “We only have your word on it.”
“Why else would I be here? I am in as much danger as the rest of you.”
“She’s right, Syd. I can’t figure out a reason for her to lie about all this,” Jake said.
“That doesn’t mean she isn’t,” Syd retorted, but she settled back into the chair. “So what’s the information?”
Isabela said, “Recently Los Zetas had a few shipments seized. Their top men think they have a mole.”
“There’s a lot of that going around,” Syd commented. Jake silenced her with a sharp look.
Isabela continued, “The general called all Los Zetas commanders back to the camp, so he can figure out who is the traitor. Luis says the Sinaloans found out about this and they plan to raid the camp now. They are going to execute the leadership and take over their prisoners.”
“A power grab,” Jake said. “If they take the camp and eliminate the top guys, they’effectively seized their base of operations.”
“Exactly,” Isabela said.
“And your friend just called up and told you this?” Syd asked.
“Luis was the one who first told me my father was being held there.”
“That was nice of him,” Syd said.
“Prisoners will die during the raid,” Isabela retorted. “Luis wanted to prepare me for bad news.”
“This is such a crock.” Syd rolled her eyes. “If a major cartel was planning a raid, don’t you think we’d have seen some of them rolling through here by now? There’s only one road.”
“They are already waiting on the other side of the mountain,” Isabela insisted.
“You have to admit, Isabela, it sounds awfully convenient,” Jake said slowly. He held up a hand to fend off her protests. “I’m not saying I don’t believe you, but it’s a huge coincidence.”
“What reason would I have to lie about this?” Isabela asked, challenging them with her eyes.
What reason indeed, Jake wondered.
“Good to see you, Valencia,” Calderon said.
Valencia nodded and lit a cigarette. “Not much time, sir. Do you know where the others are?”
“I don’t know if Kaplan survived,” Flores said. “I think it’s just us.” For the first time since this nightmare began, he felt a ray of hope. They hadn’t been forgotten. Hell, they might even get out of here alive.
They stood near the entrance to the pen, keeping their voices low. Flores glanced over—next door, Ramon Tejada was taking an interest in their conversation. From what he’d observed, interactions with the guards were limited, and their pen had clearly gotten more than the usual share of attention the past two days.
“What’s the plan?” Flores lowered his voice and moved closer to the door.
Valencia blew smoke toward the treetops before saying, “This is recon. No plan yet.”
“If we don’t get out by tonight, they’ll kill us,” Calderon said urgently.
“They might kill us sooner,” Flores said. “Things have gotten complicated.”
“Complicated how?”
“They’re trying to get Calderon to work with them, arranging kidnappings,” Flores said. “He’s going to tell them yes to buy some time, but either way one of us probably won’t be walking out of here.”
“Huh.” Valencia’s eyes flicked over to Calderon. “I’ll let Brown know.”
“Oh, thank God. I was hoping Ellis would be here,” Calderon exclaimed.
“We’re doing what we can, sir. Be ready to move.” With t Valencia shifted away.
Flores and Calderon watched him leave. Valencia kept his head down as he strolled past the pens. As he circled the guard tower, a soldier barked something down at him. Flores froze, terror gripping his heart. Valencia had to make it out, had to let the others know where to find them. He felt the hope deflating.
Valencia said something in response, and there was a cackle of laughter from above. Valencia ground out his cigarette under a boot heel, turned the corner and disappeared. For a long moment, they both remained silent. When a few minutes passed without the sound of gunfire, Flores let his shoulders relax.
Calderon turned to him, expression jubilant. “You see, amigo? Now all we have to do is stall for time.”
Flores was about to reply when a shadow darkened the door of their cage. He looked up to find another guard staring in at them, the same one who had escorted him to see the general. The guard fumbled with the lock, then the door swung open. He pointed at Flores.
“Venga conmigo,” he said gruffly.
