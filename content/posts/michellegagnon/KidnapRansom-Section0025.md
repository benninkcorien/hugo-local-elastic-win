Twenty-Six
Jake cursed again as he slipped and slid another ten feet. His face was covered in scratches from where branches had torn at his flesh. Mark’s flashlight bounced along twenty feet ahead of him—Jake hadn’t seen him fall yet. Apparently he’d inherited all the balance.
Nearly the entire Tyr contingent had taken off down the mountain, running full bore. Jake had followed without stopping to think it through. Mark was still fast as hell, he’d give him that. The rest of the group, Decker included, was charging along behind them. He’d managed to stay within a hundred feet of his brother by sheer force of will, but it felt like his lungs were going to burst from his chest. Jake kept waiting to hear gunfire—it was inconceivable that they wouldn’t be heard by this “Sock” character they were pursuing, or worse yet, by another Zetas patrol.
Jake surmised that Sock was the mole who sold out Mark’s mission in the first place. Why the Tyr folks kept him around after discovering that was frankly beyond him. It was funny, when he and Syd established The Longhorn Group, they’d modeled it almost entirely after Tyr, the gold standard of Kidnap & Ransom firms. Now that he’d seen them in action, he was wondering if they wouldn’t have been better off emulating the Keystone Kops.
Up ahead, Mark suddenly skidded to a stop. Jake pulled up short. Someone slammed into his back a second later, sending him sprawling with a grunt. Syd rolled off him.
“Christ, Riley, a little warning next time,” she grumbled, reaching for an AK-47 that had skidded a few feet away.
Jake got back to his feet. He extended a hand to help her up, but she dismissed it with a withering look. Ever since their encounter, she’d been almost nasty to him. Either Syd was just as uncomfortable about what had happened, or she didn’t care for his reaction to it. He wondered what she’d been expecting. Anyway, this wasn’t the time or place to deal with it.
Jake followed her, bent nearly double as they approached Mark. His brother had hunkered down next to an enormous fern. On the other side of it, the moon lit up an enormous man with blond hair sheared close to his head. His hands were in the air. Two Mexicans were brandishing assault rifles at him. The prison camp fence was less than fifty yards away. Jake glanced up to the nearest guard tower and spotted the barrel of a large machine gun.
“Shit,” Mark said with resignation. “He got to them.”
“Maybe not,” Syd said in a low voice. “It sounds like they have no idea who he is.”
Sock was speaking loudly in broken Spanish. Whatever he was saying didn’t seem to be registering. The two guards moved closer, shouting. Sock slowly lowered to his knees. One of the guards stepped forward, then turned his head to say something.
Fast as lightning, Sock grabbed the barrel of the gun and yanked it from the guard’s grasp. The strap still hung from the guy’s shoulder, and he was whipped to the ground. Sock switched his grip on it quickly, jamming the butt against the base of the guy’s throat, pinning him. He yelled something to the other guard, who didn’t seem to know how to react.
“What’s he saying?” Jake asked.
“He’s claiming to be friends with a General Gente. He’s demanding to be taken to see him,” Syd said in a low voice.
“We can’t let that happen.” Mark raised his gun to his shoulder, aiming for the back of the Sock’s head.
“The noise will alert the camp,” Syd warned.
“I know. No avoiding it now, though.”
Jake started to protest, then shut his mouth. If this guy Sock was the reason most of Mark’s team ended up dead, it was his call to make. Still, Jake wasn’t a fan of shooting a man down in cold blood. And alerting the camp to their presence eliminated the element of surprise they were counting on. Of course, if Sock got to this general, that was a wash anyway.
A rustling behind them. Jake jerked his head around. Decker and Brown appeared, also bent low.
Brown took in the situation, including the guard tower. “Hope to God they don’t have thermal sights up there,” he said, focused on the muzzles pointed down at the scene below. “We’ll light them up like a Christmas tree.”
“If they did, we’d already be dead,” Mark murmured in response.
“So what’re you waiting for?” Brown said in a low voice. “Shoot that asshole.”
Mark didn’t respond. His finger moved the trigger back an increment. Jake recognized his brother’s expression: he was girding himself for something he didn’t want to do. He’d seen it countless times growing up. It seemed like no matter what was asked of him, Mark’s instinctive reaction was always to resist. That defiance even applied to minor tasks like mowing the lawn or taking out the trash. It was why his decision to enlist had always puzzled Jake. He couldn’t comprehend his obstinate older brother signing up for a job where he’d spend his life following orders
A quick spurt of machine-gun fire, and suddenly the blond guy’s head was gone. Mark seemed surprised. He glanced down at his weapon, then at Decker.
Decker lowered his gun and shrugged. “Bastard deserved it.”
The guards took a second to recover. Once they did, they sprayed the surrounding jungle with gunfire. More rounds erupted from the tower, tearing the ferns surrounding them to shreds. Jake scrambled back. He must have set branches swaying, because suddenly all the gunfire zeroed in on their location.
“Run!” Syd yelled, already sprinting back up the mountain.
Kelly was flipping through the book when there was a knock at her hotel-room door. She opened it to find Rodriguez standing there, face shiny and red from a good scrubbing.
“Jeez, Jones.” His nose wrinkled. “You decided to skip the shower?”
“I wanted to go through this first, see if it might give us a lead on Stefan.” Kelly self-consciously took a step back.
Rodriguez held out a hand for the book. “Let me take a crack at it. And please, get in the shower. I’m starving, and there’s no way they’ll let us into a decent restaurant with you smelling like that. Or even an indecent open-air one. It’s that bad.”
“Fine.” Reluctantly Kelly handed over the book. Rodriguez plopped down in a chair, and she went into the bathroom. Over the noise of the shower, she heard occasional exclamations. It was shocking how much filth came off her. The water only ran clear after ten dedicated minutes of scrubbing. It was tough to balance without a handicap bar; she dropped the soap a few times and almost fell out of the tiny stall trying to retrieve it. It was funny that today she’d actually been less aware of her injury than usual. Despite the pain, having something else to focus on made it fade into the background. Yet a simple shower drove the point home. She wasn’t whole anymore, and never would be again.
Kelly laid a towel on the toilet seat and sat on it while she dried off and strapped her prosthesis back on. Rodriguez had scrounged up some clean clothes for her. The T-shirt was a size too small, the pants too large, but she rolled up the cuffs and examined herself in the mirror. Purple bruises were emerging on her face, and her throat still showed the ghosts of Stefan’s hands in bright red marks. She swallowed hard, once again feeling the life being choked out of her. Kelly shook it off. She ran a brush through her hair and went back into the bedroom.
“The guy who wrote this is nuts,” Rodriguez declared without looking up. “I mean, man, you should read the stuff in here. And he’s treating it like the Gospel.”
“I know,” Kelly said. The book was a pseudohistorical text. Based on a single claim that one of the Aztec kings had red hair, the author posited that the Vikings had made their way to the Mexican peninsula during the tenth century.
“It says that they found longboat hulls in Baja. Is that true?” He looked up at her.
Kelly shrugged. “I have no idea. But obviously Stefan thinks it’s true. There’s a lot of stuff like that. But so far I haven’t found anything that might tell us where he’s headed.”
“Huh.” Rodriguez flipped forward another few pages, then his eyes widened. “Did you see this?”
Kelly leaned in to peer over his shoulder. On the right hand side of the page was a drawing of a temple. At the top, one figure stood over another. The caption read, “Ritual Sacrifice during Tlacaxipehualiztli (6 March–25 March).”
“The Aztecs practiced a lot of ritual sacrifice,” Kelly said. “They used to throw kids into volcanos.”
“Right, but look at what he’s holding up.”
Kelly leaned in. The image was fuzzy around the edges and she had to squint to make out the details. “It looks like a jacket.”
“Unless I’m wrong,” Rodriguez said, “that’s human skin.”
