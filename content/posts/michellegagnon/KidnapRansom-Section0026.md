Twenty-Seven
Kelly felt a rush of excitement as she examined the image. “It says this is a sacrifice to Xipe Totec. Do you have your computer?”
“Back in my room. I kind of doubt we’ll get a wireless connection here, though,” Rodriguez said. “The phone in my room doesn’t even work.”
“We have to try.” Kelly skimmed the margin notes. Unfortunately most were in Danish, the cribbed handwriting so small she could barely make out the text. “We’ll have to translate this, too. And find out where that pyramid is.”
“So you think Stefan is copying ancient Aztec sacrifices now?” Rodriguez raised an eyebrow. “That kid he killed didn’t have any of the same wounds as the college girls. That would mean he’s totally broken from his M.O.”
“I know, it’s not textbook,” Kelly said. “But it’s still a form of ritual sacrifice. Maybe that’s all that matters to him, having a larger justification for killing his victims.”
“It’s still a stretch, Jones. If he’s that crazy, maybe he even thought that dump was an Aztec pyramid.”
“Or maybe the pyramid used to be there.” Kelly hoped not, though. She knew that Stefan was insane, but at least in the past that insanity had been grounded in reality. He’d probably been using the dump as a base to practice—it perfectly suited his needs, with an endless supply of potential victims and little risk of interference by the authorities. If this was anything like his previous scheme at the university, he was building up to something larger. Their best shot at catching him lay in figuring out what that would entail.
“All right,” Rodriguez sighed. “I’ll get my computer. But the deadline still stands—if we don’t have a better lead by tomorrow, we’re out of here.”
“Of course,” Kelly said. “Keeping my bag packed just in case.”
“Funny,” Rodriguez said. “Be ready to go in five. We’ll probably have better luck getting WiFi at the restaurant anyway.”
Kelly grabbed her backpack and scanned the room to make sure she wasn’t leaving anything behind. She had a funny feeling they wouldn’t end up coming back tonight. For the first time in a long while, she felt a familiar spark, that sense of a case about to break open. It was a sensation she’d almost given up on ever experiencing again. She had no intention of leaving without seeing this through. If lying about her willingness to go home tomorrow kept Rodriguez here a bit longer, so be it. In the end, she’d find a way to get Stefan with or without his help.
Running uphill was a hell of a lot harder than coming down. On the plus side, Jake wasn’t slipping as much. But the whole time he kept expecting to feel the hot burn of a bullet penetrating his back. He’d seen the damage that an automatic weapon inflicted on human flesh. In a place this isolated, there was no surviving that kind of wound. If one of them got hit, they’d have to be left behind.
Syd was still ahead of him, and he could hear the rest of the group following. He’d lost all sense of bearings, and prayed that Syd knew where the hell she was going. The gunfire must have put the Zeta camp on high alert, who knew how many units would be combing the jungle for them now. They’d have to move the whole team back and regroup, if not retreat entirely. Without the element of surprise on their side, Jake couldn’t conceive of any way they’d be able to pull off the invasion.
Syd vanished behind a tree. He followed, almost slamming into her when she stopped dead.
“We’ve got to stop meeting like this,” she commented, pushing him back with one hand.
“Why are we stopping?”
“Because I don’t think they’re following us anymore.”
Jake listened. Gunfire still crackled below them. “I still hear it.”
“Yeah, but that’s not close.” She cocked her head to the side. “Sounds like it’s coming from the far side of camp.”
Mark suddenly passed the tree. Syd let out a low whistle. He spun in his tracks and spotted them. “Decker and Brown are headed back to base to regroup,” he said. “We should join them.”
“I don’t know if we have time. Listen.”
Mark’s eyebrows knit together. “Crap,” he said. “The other cartel.”
“They probably heard the gunfire, figured that was their cue to start the raid,” Syd said.
“I’ll call Brown on the radio,” Mark said, pulling it off his belt. “We better get in there now if we want to save anything but corpses.”
