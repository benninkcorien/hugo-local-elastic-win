Forty-Three
“Holy crap,” Rodriguez said.
Kelly was inclined to agree. “Where are we?”
The underground river had terminated in a long, metal tube that shot her out into the open. She was now floating in the middle of a canal. Twenty feet away, a brightly painted flat-bottomed boat filled with people drifted along, guided by what appeared to be a gondolier. After what they had just been through, surreal didn’t even begin to describe it.
“Believe it or not, I actually know,” Rodriguez groaned. “Lago Xochimilco.”
“Lago what?” Jake swam a few strokes to pull up beside them. The gondolier had swung his boat around and was paddling toward them. A few of the passengers were snapping photos.
“Lago Xochimilco. They held the rowing competitions here during the 1968 Olympics.” Rodriguez glanced around. “Kind of like the canals in San Antonio. That boat is called a trajinera. My parents took me to a great restaurant here once. Best taco I ever had in my life.”
The boat pulled up alongside them, and the gondolier yelled something. Rodriguez replied, and an oar was extended. He shoved his dry bag over the side, then awkwardly climbed on board.
“What are you doing?” Kelly asked.
“We can rent a boat. I’m done nearly drowning today.” Rodriguez shook his head like a dog, spraying the nearby tourists with droplets.
Kelly let herself be hauled aboard. She dripped muddy water on the deck as a dozen passengers gaped openly at her.
“What the hell happened to you, sweetie?” asked a woman with a strong Texas drawl. She was dressed in a green fleece jacket and cowboy hat.
“Long story,” Kelly grumbled.
“Here. Take my jacket.” She stripped it off, handing it to Kelly.
“I can’t—”
“Sure you can. Ugliest thing I own, but it’s warm. I was gonna leave it here anyway.”
“Thanks. I really appreciate it.” Kelly took the jacket and slipped it on. Even over her wet clothes, it helped.
Rodriguez was conferring with the gondolier. Kelly saw him surreptitiously flash his creds. After a minute, he came over to where she and Jake shivered in silence.
“He’s going to have a friend bring around a trajinera for us.”
“Did he see anyone matching Stefan’s description?”
Rodriguez shook his head. “This is his first trip of the dhe’d ask around, though. Any idea where Stefan was headed?”
“He said something about the time and date of the ritual being important.”
“So you’re thinking he won’t wait until next month.”
“I don’t think so.” Kelly shook her head. “We should check that calendar again, see if there are any Aztec rituals associated with today.”
“I’ll call McLarty, see if he can get someone on that. Maybe he can convince the locals to put out a BOLO, too.” Rodriguez dug a cell phone out of his dry bag.
The tourists shifted restlessly in their seats.
“I hope they’ll give some of our money back,” one woman complained, glaring at Kelly accusingly. “You know, we paid for a full hour.”
“Hell, this is a lot more interesting than I thought it’d be,” the Texan drawled, winking at Kelly. “I was half asleep before this.”
The other woman grumbled but looked away.
Kelly took in the surrounding area. The canal was narrow, no more than twenty feet across, dotted with more of the brightly painted skiffs. On the shoreline rows of tropical trees swayed in the breeze. Just past them she could see small fields. An elderly woman in a straw hat rowed over, her canoe laden with bunches of flowers. A few of the tourists passed money over the side and came back with armfuls of garlands.
“This is bizarre,” Jake said in a low voice.
Kelly nodded, suddenly exhausted. The adrenaline drained from her body and she staggered. Jake grabbed her elbow to keep her from falling.
“You should sit.” He helped her down on a bench seat.
“Thanks.” She started to lean her head against his shoulder, then caught herself.
He noticed, and drew her head down next to his anyway. She relaxed, inhaling his scent. The banks of the river climbed on either side, until all Kelly could see were mossy walls ascending toward the sky. Trees waved slightly in the breeze, lining the canal like sentinels. It was beautiful, a dramatic change from the noise and pollution of Mexico City. There was still a haze in the sky, but the sun was gaining strength, warming her. “I’m glad you’re okay. And I’m really sorry,” she said after a minute.
“Yeah. So am I.” His voice was thick with emotion.
Kelly tilted her head to look up at him. “What is it?”
“I thought I’d lost you,” he said without looking at her. “Why didn’t you tell me you were going after him? I could have helped.”
“Mark needed you. Besides, I was only checking out a lead that he was still alive. The rest of it…well, I didn’t plan that part.”
“God, Kelly.” He shook his head. “The whole point is that we should be able to tell each other anything.”
“I know, you’re right.” After a pause, she continued, “The funny thing is, running into Stefan actually put things inerspective.”
“That is funny.” Jake’s voice was flat.
“You have every right to be angry.” Kelly lifted her head. He was still avoiding her eyes. She sighed. “We should talk when we get back. I just wanted to say everything is clearer for me now. If you still want to get married, I think we should.”
“What?” He finally looked at her. She managed a smile. “You’re serious.”
“I am. Before, I just…I was an idiot.”
He looked away again. Kelly examined him, surprised. She could have sworn he had tears in his eyes. “Jake?”
“Let’s talk about it later,” he said thickly.
“Okay.” She sat back up, wounded.
An empty boat pulled up alongside them. The gondoliers exchanged ropes, binding the trajineras together. Kelly let Rodriguez help her aboard.
After they were settled, he said, “So this guy will take us back to the dock, we can try to find an internet place there. McLarty said he’d call back within the hour.”
“Okay.” Kelly nodded, but impatience gnawed at her. It was horrible to sit here, helpless, when Stefan might already be killing someone else.
Rodriguez’s dry bag emitted a tinny ring. He dug through it and produced a cell phone. “It’s yours,” he said, tossing it to Jake.
When he saw the number, Jake’s face clouded over. He clicked it open and asked, “How is he?”
Kelly and Rodriguez exchanged a puzzled look.
“Okay, I’m on my way.” Jake snapped the phone shut and turned to Rodriguez. “I have to get to the hospital. Mark just got out of surgery.”
“What? Why didn’t you say anything?” Kelly asked, startled. “How bad is it?”
“Bad.” Jake’s head was bowed. “Chris is flying in, but I’m not sure he’ll make it in time.”
“Sorry, man,” Rodriguez said consolingly. “He said it’ll only take fifteen minutes or so to get back. The city isn’t far away.”
“I’m so sorry.” Kelly wrapped an arm around his shoulder. “You shouldn’t have come after me.”
“What else was I supposed to do? You could have died down there.” Jake dropped his head in his hands.
Kelly rubbed his shoulder. Mark’s condition changed everything. She couldn’t in good conscience go after Stefan now, leaving Jake to face this alone. “I’ll go with you to the hospital.”
“You don’t have to.”
“I want to.”
“Fine.”
They sat in silence. The gondolier’s cell phone rang. After listening for a minute, he shouted into the receiver. Slapping the phone shut, he d oar down hard. Their boat slowly pivoted.
“What’s going on?” Kelly asked.
“Qué pasa?” Rodriguez called out to the gondolier. The man responded, gesticulating furiously as he jabbered. Rodriguez’s brow darkened as he translated. “Someone grabbed a local kid, a young boy who helps his mom sell food from their boat. Yanked him right over the side. The mom tried to stop him, but the guy knocked her overboard. He’s heading downriver to join the search for the kid.”
“It’s Stefan. Has to be,” Kelly said.
“Yeah,” Rodriguez agreed. “Bastard just won’t give up.”
“We can’t let these people go after him alone. It’s too dangerous.”
Rodriguez’s jaw worked as he looked downriver. “If he still has dynamite, he could really do some damage. No matter what we say, the driver is headed away from the dock.”
“Have him drop me onshore, I’ll get back on my own.” Jake stood, grabbing hold of one of the support beams as he scanned the shoreline. The edge sloped up to a grassy field. “Has to be a road around here somewhere,” he said.
“I’ll ask,” Rodriguez said. “I’m not sure how far away the docks are, though.”
Jake didn’t answer.
Kelly watched him, conflicted.
Jake looked down at her. “You want to go after him, don’t you?”
Kelly hesitated before answering. “I’m going to the hospital with you.”
“That’s not what I asked.”
“Of course I want to go after him,” she said. “Stefan nearly killed me again. He’s got a kid.” With a shudder she remembered the corpse in the dump. “He skinned his last victim. It was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen, Jake. I don’t want him hurting anyone else.”
Jake knelt beside her and looked in her eyes. “Then you should go.”
Kelly shook her head. “No. I’m going with you.”
Jake cupped her face in his hand and ran a thumb along her cheek. “I haven’t seen you like this in a long time.”
“All beat up?” Kelly managed a weak smile.
“Like yourself again. That’s the woman I want to marry.” He looked up. They were nearly at the embankment. “I don’t feel right leaving you here. Maybe I should stay and help.”
“Absolutely not,” Kelly said firmly. “Mark needs you. I’ve got Danny backing me up, we’ll be fine.”
“I guess.” Jake eyed the shore uncertainly. “I’ve got a bad feeling about this, though. You’re not on a good streak down here.”
“When am I ever on a good streak?” Kelly said ruefully.
Jake laughed. “ since we met, that’s for sure.”
“I feel awful about letting you go through this alone,” Kelly said. Jake had left his wounded brother’s side to come save her. Sending him to maintain a solitary vigil didn’t feel right. “Are you sure?”
“Yeah, I’m sure. But don’t get killed.”
“I won’t. Promise.” Kelly wrapped her arms around him. He hugged her back, hard.
A few feet away from shore, the gondolier called something out.
“This is as close as he can get without beaching the boat,” Rodriguez explained.
“Guess that’s my cue.” Jake kissed Kelly on the forehead, then on her nose, then on her mouth. “I love you,” he said, holding her chin.
“I love you, too.”
“Hospital Ingles. Call me when you get him.” Jake handed his backpack to Kelly. “There’s an H&K in there, won’t need it where I’m headed.”
“Okay.” Kelly swallowed hard, trying to get rid of the lump in her throat. “Thanks.”
Rodriguez shook Jake’s hand. “Good luck getting back to the city.”
Jake nodded. With one final glance back at Kelly, he set a foot on the gunwale and leaped to shore.
The gondolier dug his pole back into the shallow bottom of the canal and steered them forward. The sun was climbing in the sky and blue patches broke through the haze. As soon as Jake vanished over the lip of the bank, Kelly turned to Rodriguez. “Can you think of any temples around here where the Aztecs performed sacrifices? Stefan must have a specific destination in mind.”
Rodriguez shrugged. “There are tons of them, depending on how far away he’s willing to go. Pyramid of the Sun, Pyramid of the Moon…the Aztecs liked killing people, they did it pretty much everywhere.”
“The closer, the better. He’s not going to be able to travel far carrying a victim.”
Rodriguez turned to the gondolier, who was back on his phone. He held up a finger for them to wait, then hung up. He said something in Spanish, jaw set as he paddled harder.
“His friend found a rubber raft beached about a mile downriver. They’re all headed there now,” Rodriguez translated.
“How many of them?”
“At least a dozen men. They’re trying to raise some of the guys on shore to help out, form a net so he can’t get away.”
“He’ll be dangerous cornered.”
“We’ve got strength in numbers on our side, though. Better than when it was just us.”
“I suppose,” Kelly said uncertainly. The gondolier appeared enraged. She wasn’t about to let a bloodthirsty mob kill Stefan, no matter how much he deserved it. The question was, would she and Danny be able to stop them?
Kelly leaned forward on the bench, shielding her eyes with one hand. “There it is—” She pointed. About twenty feet off the bow, a cluster of boats was strung together. They appeared hastily abandoned, no passengers in sight. Stefan’s rubber raft was beached on shore, a rope securing it to the trunk of a tree. The bank surrounding it was steep.
The gondolier steered them over. When the boat got close enough, he tossed a bumper over the side and looped a bowline around the beam of the nearest boat.
“This is too easy,” Kelly said to herself.
“What?” Rodriguez asked.
“Stefan’s crazy, but he’s not an idiot.” She turned and scanned the opposite bank. “We should split up and check both sides, just in case.”
The gondolier had already charged off, clambering from one boat to another.
Rodriguez called after him, “Amigo! Espere!”
Without responding the gondolier jumped into the water, sloshing the last few feet to shore. He scrambled up the bank, vanishing on the other side.
“So much for strength in numbers,” Rodriguez sighed. “So what do you think? Check the other side on our own?”
Kelly pursed her lips, debating. “I hate to think what’ll happen if they catch him and we’re not there.”
“It’ll be even worse if they don’t find him,” Rodriguez pointed out.
“Okay. Let’s start on the other side.” Kelly helped Danny untie the boat and push off. It was maddening how Stefan always seemed to stay one step ahead of them.
Rodriguez struggled with the oar, fighting the current trying to sweep them downstream. After ten minutes, he managed to steer them across to the other side.
“That was a hell of a lot harder than it looked,” he said, wiping sweat from his brow.
Kelly swung her legs over the side and landed hip deep in the water, keeping a tight grip on the bowline. She awkwardly waded forward, towing the boat behind her. A few feet from shore, she looped the line around a tree stump and triple-knotted it.
Rodriguez landed beside her. “You’d think the water would be warmer out here,” he grumbled as he passed her Jake’s pack.
“At least we didn’t have to swim.” Kelly dug out the H & K and checked it quickly before tucking it in her waistband. She slung on the backpack as she eyed the steep riverbank. “Mind helping me up?”
Rodriguez clambered up first, cursing under his breath as his feet slid in the mud. At the top, he reached down to help her.
After a few minutes of struggling, she made it up. “Thanks.” She wiped muddy palms on her sodden pants as she scanned the landscape. They were in some sort of field.
“They call these chinampas. They’re kind of like rice paddies,” Rodriguez said. “It’s going to be swampy“I can tell,” Kelly said. Her boots had sunk into the mud and water pooled around them.
There was a single shack at the far edge of the field, roof caved in. The rest of the terrain was barren, no houses, just a dirt road lined with telephone poles.
“I don’t see any temples,” Kelly said.
“I haven’t been here since I was a kid, but I don’t remember any,” Rodriguez said. “And trust me, if there had been, we would have gone to see them. My dad never met a ruin he didn’t love.”
“I guess we should check the shack,” Kelly said doubtfully. Everything about this felt wrong. Performing a ritual during broad daylight, in a field in the middle of nowhere, didn’t mesh with Stefan’s flair for the dramatic. But if he was planning on conducting the sacrifice somewhere else, he could have waited to grab a victim. Maybe snatching the boy had just been a diversion. But for all Stefan knew, she was dead and he was scot-free, so why bother?
Rodriguez shrugged. “We’re here. Looks like a long shot, though. We could always get back in the boat, see if we can spot him downriver.”
Kelly hesitated. “Let’s check this out first,” she finally said. “Maybe he’s lying low until things calm down.”
They crossed the field carefully, sticking to dry ground as much as possible. It was slow going, and Kelly was painfully aware of time slipping away from them. She couldn’t stop picturing Stefan’s look of triumph when he left her in the cave.
Ten feet from the shack, she turned to tell Rodriguez they should head back. As she opened her mouth to speak, there was a loud moan from inside.
