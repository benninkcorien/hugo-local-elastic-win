FEBRUARY 2
Thirty-Seven
She owed Brandi a debt, Kelly thought as she drifted downstream. She was much more comfortable in the water than she would have been before starting physical therapy. Not that it was pleasant. The water was cold and brackish. Slimy things kept brushing up against her. As soon as she swept through the hole, something icy slid across her leg. Kelly jolted away, nearly losing her pack and flashlight. She caught both just in time. She struggled to remain calm. This would be a hell of a time to have a panic attack.
The tube narrowed. The ceiling was about three feet above her head, and she had five feet on either side of her. A hundred feet in, the current gathered speed. The roof seemed to be sloping down, walls narrowing to a point in front of her.
Kelly took a deep breath. The walls here were bare. Steam rose off the river, curling up and around her like wraiths determined to drag her underwater. The reason the current was quickening suddenly became apparent: at the very edge of where her flashlight penetrated the gloom, she saw another hole in the wall. The river raced toward it.
Kelly felt oddly unafraid. She swept along, fingers cramping from her death grip on the flashlight and backpack. The river gained speed. The rift appeared far too small for her to fit through, yet she remained buoyed by an overwhelming sense of peace and calm. It certainly wasn’t where she’d expected to die, or how, but it was oddly fitting. Her original showdown with Stefan had started underground and ended by a river. Apparently history was repeating itself.
Ten feet from the opening.
The hole was larger than she’d initially perceived, the stone edges surrounding it worn smooth. Water churned at the entrance, small whitecaps sloshing among the brown.
Five feet.
Kelly panted a few times to empty her lungs, then drew in a deep breath right before the torrent sucked her down.
The rushing current nearly yanked the backpack and flashlight from her grip. Kelly clutched them to her chest, hugging them tightly. Her left knee banged against something and she nearly opened her mouth to gasp in pain. She drew her legs in to her chest. The water spun her, it was impossible to tell which way was up anymore. Her flashlight caught odds and ends of stone, most just before she smacked into them. Something hit her chin as she shot past, then her elbow. It felt like the channel was narrowing even more. She curled into a ball, trying to make herself as small as possible. Her lungs started to burn.
Kelly fought the urge to breathe in. She wondered how long she’d been under. Thirty seconds? A minute? She’d never tried to hold her breath for an extended period. She had no idea how long could last.
Suddenly Kelly felt herself rising, buoyed by the air reserve in her chest. She fought her way up, clawing at the water with her free hand. Kelly exploded out of the surface, exhaling hard, choking as some water shot into her mouth. She sucked in air greedily. The flashlight shone up from below. Kelly tried to take a stroke with her right arm, kicking her left leg to maneuver herself back into a floating position.
But something was wrong, she wasn’t moving. She tried again, then switched her grip on the light so that it pointed down.
Her prosthetic foot was wedged into a crevice between two rocks.
Water pressure built up behind her, driving her head down. Kelly had been white water kayaking a few times, and knew this was how most people drowned. She sucked in another gulp of air and dived below the surface. She struggled to free the prosthetic, but her hands kept sliding off the slick polyurethane foam cover. She jerked with her hip, but that only sent shooting pains through her stump.
Kelly broke the surface again, gasping. The current seemed stronger, determined to defeat her. She spit out water as she struggled to breathe. She was drowning slowly. She didn’t have a choice. She’d have to abandon the prosthetic and go after Stefan with one leg.
There wasn’t much time left. Already she felt sluggish. Her arms were tiring and she was beginning to feel sleepy, a clear sign that hypothermia was setting in. She shrugged the backpack over her shoulders—it was already soaked, no point trying to keep it above the surface any longer.
Sucking in a deep breath, Kelly dived again. She struggled to unfasten her prosthetic. The silicone liner was rolled tightly over her stump. Her hands slipped, the liner refused to budge. Just as she was starting to panic, worried that the water had somehow created an airtight seal, it slipped off. She was free.
Kelly shot forward quickly. She stretched her left leg out in front of her as the current bumped and jostled her. The top of the chamber was inches above her head, her nose almost skimmed it. Kelly drew in deep breaths, holding the air in her lungs for a few seconds each time.
Suddenly, without warning, she was sucked back underwater.
Rodriguez pressed the buzzer again, irritated. It was just before dawn. There should have been someone watching the gate to the embassy. Apparently security wasn’t as tight as he would have expected.
It was a full five minutes before footsteps approached from the other side of the gate. A door opened and closed, and a bleary-eyed guard appeared in the window of the guardhouse.
“Buenos días, señor,” he said with a yawn.
Rodriguez pressed his badge against the window. “I need to get inside, now.”
The guard blinked at the ID, unimpressed. A metal drawer slid open in front of Rodriguez. The guard motioned for him to drop his credentials inside. He drew it back to him, picked up the case and examined it. Rodriguez tapped a finger on the narrow metal ledge. “Any day now,” he muttered.
The guard held up the ID, comparing the photo to Rodriguez’s face. Apparently satisfied, he put the Ito the drawer, along with a green pass. “Everyone is still asleep, Señor Rodriguez,” he said. “You’ll have to wait.”
Rodriguez jabbed a finger toward the phone beside the guard’s right hand. “Wake them up,” he said. “Or I’ll go do it myself.”
