“I can’t believe you let her go in there alone.” Jake fumed as he panned a light across the subterranean river. Threads of vapor rose off the surface.
“Hey, she didn’t leave me a choice. It was either follow her and drown, or go for help. You of all people know how she can be,” Rodriguez said pointedly. “Hell, I’ll be lucky not to get arrested for defacing a cultural site.”
“Still, you should have tried to stop her.” Jake’s light came to a halt at the hole in the wall. “Jesus. Or at least tried to find a boat.”
“Yeah, because those are easy to find at four in the morning.” Rodriguez snorted.
“Well, we’ve got one now.” Jake eyed the tiny inflatable raft the embassy had lent them. It looked like a kid’s toy. He suspected they’d appropriated it from their swimming pool. With any luck it would remain afloat. “Let’s get going.”
Rodriguez grumbled as he tightened the straps of a tiny life jacket, the only one they’d been able to locate. One of the embassy hacks was back on the surface, trying to convince some enraged archaeologists that the destruction of the mural had been necessary for national security. Jake doubted that argument was working. Still, it bought him and Rodriguez time to go after Kelly. As soon as the federales showed up, that window of opportunity would close. They had to get moving.
Jake eased the boat into the water. It bobbed a few times. He held it still while Rodriguez climbed in. The bottom almost immediately filled with water, and Rodriguez hissed. Without giving him a chance to protest, Jake climbed in and pushed off.
Taking the flimsy rubber paddle in both hands, he guided them toward the wall. He needn’t have bothered, because as soon as they slipped into the current the boat was propelled there. Rodriguez kept the light directed straight forward, illuminating the path. He clutched a dry bag to his chest, face drawn and pale.
“Get a grip, Rodriguez,” Jake muttered. “It’s probably only a couple of feet deep anyway.”
Before Rodriguez could answer, they were sucked into the hole. It was a long tunnel. The raft bounced off the walls a few times. The current gained speed, the water slipped away quickly beneath them. omething sharp pressed against his leg from beneath the raft, and his mouth tightened. With the luck he was having lately, they’d sink before finding Kelly, and he’d have to save Rodriguez. Although the way he felt about him right now, that wasn’t his highest priority.
“Jesus,” Rodriguez said loudly. “We’ll never make it through there!”
Jake looked ahead. The tunnel was narrowing to a point. Rodriguez was right; the raft was probably too large to fit through.
“Lie as flat as you can,” he ordered, “and hold on to the sides.”
Jake got low, pressing his back against the floor of the raft, knees tucked down. It sank an inch lower and water sloshed over the sides, the cold making him shudder. Rodriguez’s head crammed against his legs. He lowered the flashlight. They were suddenly hurtling into darkness.
Rubber scraped against rock, and they jarred to a stop. His body rocked slightly from the impact. The raft was caught on something.
“We’re stuck!” Rodriguez called out, panicked.
Jake could feel the pressure building up behind them. More water poured over the sides, drenching his shoulders. If they didn’t get free soon, the boat would sink.
“Hang on,” he said, unclipping the flashlight from his belt. He reached over the side and scanned the light around. They were blocking an even narrower opening inside the tunnel, impeding the progress of the water.
“I’m going to shove us off,” he said. “But the boat might puncture or go down. If it does, get away from the raft and keep your feet up. Don’t try to stand.”
Jake pushed hard with his right arm: nothing. He tried again, this time using both hands, the flashlight dangling from a strap around his wrist. With a lurch, the boat spun free. Jake dropped back to the floor, rapping his head hard against a rocky outcropping on the way down. He winced, barely processing the pain. There was a ripping sound as the raft shot through the hole.
“We made it!” Rodriguez’s head popped up, outlined by the glow from Jake’s flashlight. His eyebrows knit together. “What’s that sound?”
Jake sat back up and panned his light along the outside of the raft. There was a long slit in the rubber right above the waterline. Air was hissing out at an alarming rate. “I’ve got bad news.”
Rodriguez was beside him in a flash, the sudden motion nearly capsizing them.
“Careful,” Jake warned, but Rodriguez ignored him.
“Crap. You bring any duct tape?”
“Don’t be—” Jake caught himself. Syd had packed their go-kits. And if he knew Syd, there was a roll of duct tape tucked inside his. He fumbled for the bag. The zipper resisted his first few tugs.
“We’re sinking,” Rodriguez noted apprehensively, clenching the dry bag to his chest. “Do you think this bag floats?”
“Shine your light over here so I can see.” Jake pawed through the contents of his backpack. The inside of the bag was suddenly ilinated. Jake sorted through energy bars and loose ammo until his hand closed around something circular. He yanked it out: a roll of silver duct tape.
“Wow. You really take that Boy Scout motto to heart,” Rodriguez said.
Jake didn’t answer, busy peeling off the outer wrapper. He yanked off a long line of tape, tearing it with his teeth. “Hold the hole closed.”
Rodriguez set his bag down on the floor of the raft. Reaching both hands over the side, he squeezed the ragged edges together. Jake managed to tape a section. He tore off another strip of tape, and they repeated the process. Five strips later, the hole had been sealed.
“We’re still taking in water,” Rodriguez said.
He was right. The raft had lost too much air. With their combined weight it barely cleared the surface. A steady stream of water slipped over the side.
“Start bailing,” Jake said.
“With what?” Rodriguez demanded, palms open. “Any chance you have an air pump in there?”
“Nope.” Jake started scooping with his hands. He quickly realized it was a losing battle. He dug through the pack again, but there was nothing better to bail with.
“Brace yourself,” he finally said, slinging his arms through the loops of the pack.
“For what?” Rodriguez asked, his voice filled with dread.
“We’re going to have to abandon ship.”
Stefan had finally fallen silent after what felt like an hours-long monologue about the Aztec calendar, Vikings and what he planned on doing with his immortality. Apparently he’d been hungering for someone to talk to. He addressed her as though she was an old friend. It was bizarre.
Kelly had tuned him out after a few minutes. She lay flat on her back trying to loosen the bindings around her wrists. It was difficult. Her fingers were still numb and the rope was wet. Every time she felt one knot release, she discovered another. Stefan hadn’t taken any chances.
She prayed he’d leave her alone for a while, so she could try to burn through the ties. Stefan appeared supremely confident that he had the upper hand, which worked in her favor. The fact that he hadn’t killed her yet was puzzling, but it gave her hope.
Hope. Kelly nearly laughed out loud. Because one thing had struck her as she lay there in arguably the most perilous situation she’d ever faced: she wasn’t ready to die. Despite the uncertainty of her future, she wanted the chance to experience it. So she’d lost her lower leg. Lots of people had suffered the same injury and gone on to lead productive lives. In the past few days she’d proven that she was still capable of most of the things she could do before the accident.
“You’re smiling,” Stefan noted. “Why?”
“It’s funny that I had to end up here to get some clarity,” she finally replied.
Stefan squinted at her. “Perhaps there’s hope for you yet, Agent Jones. You see, there are no coincidences in life. You end up precisely where you’re supposed to be for a reason.”
“I keep forgetting that you were a preacher of sorts,” Kelly said. “Nice sermon.”
He shrugged. “A bit trite, I’ll admit, but the reason platitudes are clichéd is because they’re so frequently true.” He glanced at his watch again. “Almost time.”
Kelly’s stomach constricted. He stood and brushed off the seat of his pants. Her hands clenched into fists as she braced herself for whatever was coming.
Stefan’s lips curled into a thin smile. “Don’t worry, Agent Jones. It will only hurt for a moment.”
Syd watched as the remaining prisoners were loaded on to a bus. The surviving cartel members had been rounded up and were sitting in a circle, feet in front of them, hands behind their heads. A few were led off to the barracks building Isabela had requisitioned for interrogations. Occasional screams emanated from it. Syd had already decided that whatever was happening in there was none of her business.
She glanced at her watch impatiently. Jake should have called by now with an update on Mark. There was a tug at her sleeve. Syd instinctively yanked her arm away and spun. A wizened elderly woman was looking up at her. She had to be less than four feet tall.
“Qué quieres?” Syd snapped.
“Gracias, señora.” The woman’s lips cracked wide in a toothless smile. “Gracias por habernos salvado.”
“De nada.” Syd watched the woman shuffle off, gingerly mounting the bus stairs with the assistance of one of the PGR soldiers. Funny. She could count on one hand how many times she’d been thanked for her work in her life. Back when she was with the Agency, it was more likely she’d be put on a death list.
Isabela emerged from the barracks. After spotting Syd, she headed over.
“We’re pulling out,” Syd said. “It seems like you’ve got things under control.”
“More or less,” Isabela agreed.
“Don’t take it personally, but I hope we never see each other again.”
Isabela laughed. “In our line of work, you never know.” She watched as the bus doors swung shut. The engine started with a growl. Cheers erupted inside as it rattled toward the gate.
“So you really think this will make a difference?” Syd asked, skeptical.
Isabela shrugged. “It is like battling the Hydra. You stop one cartel, a dozen others appear. But for these people it made a difference. And we might have gained a few weeks of peace. Los Zetas were particularly dangerous, thanks to their training and level of organization. So whoever takes their place might not present such a challenge.”
“Seems futile,” Syd noted.
Isabela smiled thinly. “Es México. Most of our humor revolves around the futility of it.” She shuffled her feet, avoiding Syd’s eyes as she asked, “How is Mark?”
Syd shrugged. “No idea. Jake hasn’t called. He’s at the Hospital Ingles in Mexico City if you want to check up on him.”
“I will.” Isabela extended a hand. “Sorry for the…confusion.”
“Making sure my people don’t encounter any trouble at the border would mean more than sorry at this point,” Syd said.
Isabela nodded. “No hay problema. It will be handled.”
“Great. Adios.” Syd mock saluted, then headed for the gate.
