Twenty-Three
“Fancy meeting you here, Jones.”
Kelly blinked back tears. “How did you find me?”
Her former partner, Danny Rodriguez, stepped into the cell. He forced a smile. “The boss got a call that one of his agents was locked up down here for murder. Imagine his surprise when he heard it was you.”
“McLarty sent you?”
“Not exactly. I was in L.A. working a case, and heard the news through the grapevine. Figured I’d come bring you a cake with a file in it. Sorry I didn’t get here sooner, I caught the first flight out.” His eyes wandered down to her leg, and she realized her prosthesis was still off. She quickly reached for it, sending it tumbling off the cot to the floor. “Here, let me—”
“I’ve got it,” Kelly said sharply. As soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted them. She leaned over and scooped the prosthetic off the floor, busying herself with strapping it back on. Rodriguez kept his eyes averted, as if she were putting on a bra, not a leg. She felt a flare of rage, then tried to temper it. He was just trying to be courteous. Rodriguez had visited a few times during her recovery period, but eventually stopped showing up. Probably because she was just as surly with him as she was with everyone else.
“So.” Rodriguez leaned back against the bars. “You missed my wedding.”
“Sorry about that,” she mumbled. “Congratulations.”
“Thanks.” Rodriguez held up his ring hand. She caught a flash of gold. “It was a lot of fun. Shame you weren’t there.”
“I wasn’t up for it.”
“Yeah, I understand.”
Rodriguez appeared to have aged a decadshe last saw him. He no longer looked like an unseasoned rookie. There was an air of confidence about him now. Even his face looked leaner. He’d finally lost the last of his baby fat, and the beginnings of worry lines creased his eyes.
“Thanks for coming,” Kelly said. “I’ve been trying to explain what happened, but they didn’t bring in a translator.”
“What the hell are you doing here, Jones? Aside from killing kids, I mean.”
“It wasn’t me.”
“Yeah, I figured.” Even though he said it, she detected some doubt. Kelly could hardly blame him. When an agent went through what she had, they never came back whole. It wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility that she could have lost it. Had their positions been reversed, she’d probably be wondering the same about him.
“Remember Stefan Gundarsson, from the college case? He’s here.”
“Stefan’s dead.” Rodriguez’s brow wrinkled.
“He’s not. I saw him.”
