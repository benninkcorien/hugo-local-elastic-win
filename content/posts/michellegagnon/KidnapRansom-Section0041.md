Forty-Two
Kelly shuddered as the water licked at her shoulders. Jake floated behind her; Rodriguez paddled clumsily in the rear. The current carried her toward another opening in the wall. Jake shone a flashlight forward, illuminating it. It was wider than the one they’d entered through.
“How long is this river?” Jake asked. “It feels like we’ve gone miles already.”
“We’re probably not even outside the city yet,” Rodriguez called from the rear. “I think it’s leading south. It’ll probably meet up with the Panuco River. Most of the city’s water drains into there.”
Kelly reached the end of the chamber first. Another rumbling sound from above, and an enormous piece of the ceiling detached and fell into the water with a resounding splash. Rodriguez yelped. The force of the wave swept her to the darkness beyond.
She fought to keep her legs up, panicked at the thought of getting her foot trapped again. Something brushed against her, then grabbed her arm. She lashed out at it.
“Ouch!”
“Sorry,” she said. “Where’s your light?”
“It went out,” Jake said flatly.
“Oh.” For some reason, Kelly wasn’t as terrified as she should have been, whirling through this black pit, buffeted by the wake caused by rocks tumbling down behind them. At least this time she wasn’t alone.
“No going back now,” Rodriguez said. “Sounds like the whole roof caved in. I hope no one tries to come after us.”
“Light up ahead,” Jake said.
He was right: Kelly made out a gleam in the distance. The current was slowing, too. The tunnel narrowed. Unexpectedly, light glinted off the walls on either side, momentarily blinding her.
It took a minute for Kelly’s eyes to adjust. When they did, she almost couldn’t process what she was seeing, it was so completely unexpected.
Syd glared down at the floor. She didn’t know what to make of the situation. She’d arrived at the hospital a half hour before, only to discover that Jake had left. The nursing staff had no idea where he’d gone. Syd had an inkling. At a time like this, there was only one reason for him to leave his brother’s side. Kelly must have gotten herself into some sort of trouble, and Jake went to save her.
Much as Syd hated to admit it, the thought bothered her. Not that she expected the other night to mean anything. They’d both just been letting off steam in the middle of a tense operation. She’d done the same dozens of times all over the world, couldn’t even remember half the men’s faces now. On the ride back to Mexico City, she’d prepared a speech in case Jake thought it meant more. Gotta think of the business, she’d say brusquely. Probably better that it not happen again, just a one-time thing.
The fact that it hadn’t even occurred to him to call with an update on Mark was peeving, however. And she wasn’t much in the mood to give that speech anymore. She’d prefer to shake him hard and demand to know why he was wasting his time with Kelly. The Feeb had been irritating enough before she lost her leg. Syd figured Jake was sticking with her out of pity, that sooner or later it would fall apart of its own accord. But that was taking longer than expected.
Not that she cared, she reminded herself. None of her business either way.
She looked up to find Maltz standing beside her. He’d emerged from the battle unscathed, which was a relief. She still felt guilty for what had happened to him last summer.
He ran a hand through his hair. “Jake’s gone, huh?”
Syd shrugged. “Not my problem.”
“Sure,” Maltz said. “Nurse says Mark’ll be out of surgery soon. You want coffee?”
“Please. Cream, no sugar.” Syd sank down in a chair. Her eyes smarted as she watched Maltz limp down the hallway. Raising a hand to her cheek, she was startled to discover it was wet. Hurriedly Syd wiped away the tears.
