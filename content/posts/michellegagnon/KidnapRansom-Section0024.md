Twenty-Five
Sock was hauling ass down the mountain, half sliding on his back to get to the bottom before they shot him.
Ging away had been easier than expected. When Brown showed up in camp again, Sock knew he was in for it. Brown had already been treating him like a mole, not even allotting him a radio. Now that Riley and Decker had materialized, the jig was up. Brown assigned two guys to watch him at all times, even when he took a piss. Once everything settled down, Sock knew he was in for the beating of his life, or worse. Riley probably blamed him for the whole operation going tits up. And hey, he’d be right.
In the past Sock had worked a couple of jobs with the two goons watching him, Hayward and Figuarello. They weren’t the best Tyr had to offer—he knew it and they knew it. The fact they hadn’t bothered tying him up confirmed their incompetence. When the new group showed up in camp, it provided enough of a distraction for him to bolt.
Luckily Sock had heard enough about their plans to give the general a reason to save his ass. Initially he’d intended to sit this one out. Gente had gotten squirrelly lately, claiming Sock didn’t have enough power in the organization to prove helpful anymore. And they both knew what that meant—once Sock wasn’t valuable, he’d better hightail it stateside or there’d be an extra hole in his head to spit out of. And he hadn’t been paid nearly enough to deal with that.
Still, this was fresh intel. A rival cartel raid—that was something he could take to the bank. He just had to make it down there without getting shot.
Sock slid another few feet before regaining his footing, grabbing branches to slow his descent. The camp was less than a hundred feet away. He felt a surge of adrenaline. After all the bullshit of the past week, being forced to hunker down and play victim with the rest of his pathetic unit, having to go back in when Gente decided he still needed ears on Tyr…now it was all going to pay off. He’d collect enough greenbacks to set himself up nicely somewhere new. He already had his eye on beachfront property in Honduras. Just a little bit farther and all his money troubles would be behind him.
Kelly shifted uncomfortably, trying not to let the smell get to her. They were hunkered down inside one of the tiny shanties in the dump. Rodriguez was murmuring in Spanish with a tiny, wizened woman. She looked sixty but it was hard to tell; under all those layers of filth might lurk a thirty-year-old woman. The absence of teeth caved in her lower jaw and Kelly could tell it took some effort for her to form words. To his credit, Rodriguez leaned in to listen, despite the stench emanating from the woman’s rags. The walls shifted with shadows from the light of the single candle she’d lit, making them appear alive.
This woman was the third person who had agreed to speak with them. Initially every pepenador they approached had scampered away. One had become enraged, waving his arms and berating them with what even Kelly could tell was a stream of epithets. After that encounter Rodriguez had wisely led them back to civilization for what he called, “critical supplies.” When they returned armed with bottled water, gum and snack food, doors were suddenly flung open. But most of the pepenadores claimed to be oblivious to the fact that a giant white man was killing children in their midst. A few had scrutinized Kelly, recognition in their gaze.
Then this woman had waved them into her shanty. After greedily accepting a bottle of water and an energy bar, she launched into a monologue that Rodriguez interrupted with occasional questioninally he stood and bowed his head. “Muchas gracias, señora.”
Kelly followed him back outside. The moon had climbed in the night sky, casting their surroundings in an orange glow. If anything the smell was even worse out here; the open air did little to dissipate it.
“Christ, no wonder you reeked.” Rodriguez held a handkerchief to his nose. “Couldn’t you stumble across a killer who was holed up at the Hilton?”
“What did she say?” Kelly asked impatiently.
“She confirmed that a man they call the White Devil showed up about a year ago. Right around that time, kids started disappearing.”
“And they didn’t do anything about it?” Kelly asked.
Rodriguez shrugged. “Most of the kids here are on their own. Runaways, orphans. You gotta understand, Jones, these people are in survival mode. Pepenador literally means garbage person or scavenger. They don’t have time to worry about anyone but themselves. And they figured there was a chance the kids either returned to families if they had them, or found another way to survive.”
“Why was he called the White Devil?”
“Apparently he did some weird stuff—weird even for this crowd. Chanting, rituals. Set up an altar outside his shanty and slaughtered animals on it. Then he didn’t even eat the animals, which really threw them. They steered clear of him after that. A few of the families even pulled up stakes and moved farther away.”
“Does she know where he might have gone?”
“Nope. Her friend saw him leave out the exit to the north at dawn, running from the cops. I’m guessing that’s when they grabbed you?”
Kelly nodded.
“Well, she says he hasn’t been back since. They’re watching for him now, after what the police found. A few of them are pretty riled up. If he’s smart, he won’t come back.”
“Nice of them to show some concern now,” Kelly grumbled.
“It’s not really surprising, Jones. To be honest, the cops at the station couldn’t get rid of you quick enough. I get the feeling that unless some of the dead kid’s relatives show up, they’ll bury this thing. And she didn’t have any idea who the kid was. Chances are they’ll never ID the body.”
“Jesus,” Kelly said. The fact that a child could die so horribly, without anyone caring enough to initiate even the most basic investigation, was beyond horrifying.
“Life is viewed differently down here, Jones,” Rodriguez explained. “Justice, too. We live a pretty cushy life, all things considered.” As soon as he said it his posture changed. He’d obviously suddenly remembered her injury, but the words were already out.
“Let’s check out where he was living,” Kelly mumbled.
“Yeah, okay.” Rodriguez followed as she wove between the dark tiers. “After that, though, we’re finding a hotel. I’m gonna need a few hours in the shower
“At least you believe me now,” Kelly said after a minute. Rodriguez didn’t respond. “You do believe me, right?”
“I believe you saw someone down here. Maybe it was Stefan, maybe just someone who looks like him. Either way, he sounds like a bad guy.”
“It was Stefan,” she said firmly.
It took a half hour of wandering to locate Stefan’s shanty. They stood silent in the doorway, flashlights playing across the interior. Aside from the removal of the boy’s body and skin, it was exactly as she’d left it that morning. The shack was assembled from scavenged sheets of corrugated metal. The layers of cardboard comprising the floor were dark brown and stiff with blood. A pile of rags in the corner probably functioned as a bed. Kelly repressed a shudder at the sight of the clothesline, still draped from one side of the room to the other like a morbid Christmas garland. Aside from that, the only furniture was a rickety table dead center in the six-by-six-foot space.
“Christ, that’s a lot of blood,” Rodriguez murmured, running his flashlight beam across the muddy trails.
“I can’t believe they didn’t even bring a crime-scene unit out here,” Kelly said. There was no indication that aside from arresting her and removing the boy’s remains, the cops had done any investigating of the shanty itself. No fingerprint powder anywhere, no sign that bloodstained samples were removed. Apparently Rodriguez was right: the boy’s murder would garner no more attention than if he’d been a pigeon that inadvertently struck a window and died.
“What’s all this?” Rodriguez asked, examining the far wall. “Looks like crazy-person wallpaper.”
Kelly played her flashlight across it. She recognized some of the characters. “Runes,” she said. “Remember? That was Stefan’s thing in the other case.”
Rodriguez let out a low whistle. “Huh, maybe it really is him. Hell of a coincidence otherwise.”
“No one seems to understand that I lost my leg, not my mind,” Kelly grumbled.
“Well, let’s not pretend you were a picture of sanity before this.” Kelly raised an eyebrow. He held up his hands defensively. “I’m just saying, you’ve always been extremely driven. That’s why you were so good. You have this ability to focus on a case to the point where you shut everything else out.”
Kelly was going to retort, but the words struck home. He was right. Ever since joining the Bureau, she’d focused more on her solve rate than on her life. Which is why, when the job was gone, she’d discovered there wasn’t much of a life to go back to. “Driven isn’t the same as crazy,” she finally replied.
“It is when it makes you do crazy things. Like chasing a lunatic through a dump in a foreign country.”
“Point taken,” she said. “Of course, that means you’re probably crazy to help me.”
“Don’t remind me.” Rodriguez grinned at her. Tears suddenly smarted behind her eyelids. Kelly blinked them back, surprised. He notic
“I’m fine. Sorry.” Kelly shook her head. “Just tired, I guess.”
“Well, you’ve had a hell of a day. Maybe we should get you to a hospital. They never checked you out after that beating.” He sounded concerned.
“No hospital.” The mere mention induced memories of the constant hum of fluorescent lights and the cloying smell of disinfectant. If she had her way, she’d never set foot in a hospital again.
“You sure?”
Kelly nodded.
“Okay, then. So, getting back to our guy here.” Rodriguez turned his attention to the wall, squinting. “In the campus case he was spelling something with the girls’ bodies, right?”
“VIDAR, using the runic alphabet. It was an old Norse legend, something about a wolf.” A series of photographs flicked through Kelly’s mind. Stefan’s earlier victims had all been young, mostly college students, their bodies positioned strangely, legs bent off-kilter to spell out letters from a runic dictionary. Stefan had believed that some ancient book he’d stolen would provide the key to raising the dead, among other things. Apparently ritual sacrifice was a necessary component to the plan—but she’d managed to stop him before he claimed his final victim. And who knew, maybe he’d been right, she thought. After all, rising from the dead was a feat he’d managed to pull off in the end.
“Jesus!” Rodriguez yelped, leaping to the side.
A rat scampered past and raced out the door. Rodriguez shuddered. “I hate rats. I ever tell you that, Jones? Snakes, spiders, bring ’em on…but rats? I’m thinking it’s time for that shower.”
“One second.” The rat had emerged from the stack of bedding in the corner. Kelly went outside and grabbed a long gearshift that jutted up from one of the stacks. Back inside the shanty she prodded at the bedding, sifting through it. Something solid rested at the bottom. She tried to get a purchase with the stick, but whatever it was refused to budge. Giving up, she dropped to her good knee.
“Oh my God, you’re not going to—” Rodriguez clamped his mouth shut with a pained look as Kelly dug her hand into the center of the pile. After a second of groping around, trying not to picture Stefan sleeping there, waiting to feel another rat’s teeth biting down on her hand, Kelly found it: the hard corner of a book. With a small cry of triumph, she yanked it out.
“I had three heart attacks while you were doing that,” Rodriguez said.
“Shine the light over here.” Kelly held up the book.
“I’m really hoping you have hand sanitizer in that pack. You know how many diseases rats carry?” Rodriguez muttered. He shifted the flashlight beam so that it illuminated the cover.
It wasn’t what Kelly had been expecting. When Stefan vanished, an ancient text had disappeared at the same time. This wasn’t that book. Instead it bore the cheap laminated cover of a self-published novel, with a crudely drawn image of a Norse ship above the words Vikings in Mexico.
“Quality bedtime ,” Rodriguez said.
“I didn’t think Vikings made it anywhere near here.” Kelly flipped through the pages. The margins were covered with scrawled notes, nearly every page was filled.
“That’s because they didn’t,” Rodriguez said. “It’s ridiculous. Probably written by some nut job.”
“Well, another nut job might have believed it,” Kelly noted. She poked through the bedding again, but didn’t come up with anything else.
“Please tell me we’re done here,” Rodriguez said. “A few more minutes and I might never eat again.”
“Take pictures of the walls. I can try to decipher the runes back at the hotel,” Kelly said.
Rodriguez snapped a few shots with his camera. Kelly looked them over: they were clear enough for her to make out the scrawlings.
“So are we good?” Rodriguez asked.
“Yeah. Let’s get out of here.”
