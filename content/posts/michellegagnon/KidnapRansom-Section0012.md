Thirteen
Flores awoke in the dark. Someone was whispering nearby, and his senses immediately went on high alert. He was lying on a mat of moldering leaves, with a ratty towel functioning as a blanket. He waited for his eyes to adjust: Calderon was squatting at the opposite end of their pen. Who was he talking to?
Flores crept forward, straining to overhear. He hadn’t paid much attention yesterday to the prisoners on either side of them, and no one had gone out of their way to initiate contact. Calderon had explained that people came and went so frequently, there was generally little effort at communication. Plus rumor had it there were Zetas spies everywhere, prisoners who exchanged information for special treatment. Best to keep to yourself, he’d advised.
Yet Calderon was hunched by the far wall of their pen, and Flores could discern a figure on the other side.
Their whispers suddenly ceased. Calderon’s head whipped around, the whites of his eyes visible. “Hola compadre,” he whispered.
“Hola.” Flores moved closer. On the other side of the wires hunched a small figure with a thick beard. Although his lips weren’t moving, steady chatter emanated from him. Confused, Flores looked down: a small transistor radio was clenched in the man’s hands.
“Every night relatives send messages to loved ones who have been kidnapped,” Calderon explained, keeping his voice low. “You never know who will be on, or when, so we take turns with the radio.”
“Oh,” Flores said. Funny this hadn’t been mentioned before. A radio could potentially provide a huge advantage.
“This is Ramon Tejada.” Calderon gestured to the man in the next pen. “His wife was on the other night so he’s listening, hoping she’ll return.”
“Where did the radio come from?”
Calderon shrugged. “One of the guards traded for it awhile back. They figure it’s harmless. Even if we could reconfigure it to signal out, it would only transmit in this region. And no locals would be willing or able to help.”
Flores was no radio tebut that sounded right. Still, there was some comfort in discovering that they weren’t completely cut off from the outside world.
They sat and listened in silence as a teary-voiced woman told her daughter Ana Martinez how much she loved and missed her, how hard they were working to raise the money to get her back home.
“Is she here?” Flores asked after a minute.
“Who knows?” Tejada’s voice was weak, quavering. “There are probably a half dozen Ana Martinez’s in here.” He punctuated his words with a hacking cough. Flores moved back a few inches.
The voices of one forlorn relative after another trickled out of the tinny speakers into the night, name after name: Carlos, Maria, Adriana, Ernesto. Tears that could fill a well of sadness. Flores caught himself listening for Maryanne’s voice, which was ridiculous. Even if she knew he was missing, which she probably didn’t, there was no way she’d be aware of this call-in show. Still, it was hard to quell the hope in his heart.
There was a moment of silence, then a radio announcer with an obnoxiously cheery voice announced “Radio Aro-Am.” There was a click, then silence: Ramon had shut it off.
“Lo siento, señor,” Calderon said. “Posiblemente mañana.”
Ramon only grunted, which sparked another coughing fit. Flores followed Calderon to the other side of the pen, where their sleeping pallets were squeezed under a low-hanging tarp that served as their shelter.
“That cough.” Calderon shook his head. “He’s had it for weeks now. Not good.”
Flores was more concerned about the prospect of catching it. Illness would render an escape nearly impossible. And he was guessing the Zetas weren’t big on handing out antibiotics.
“We should get some sleep, amigo,” Calderon said, lying down. “Tomorrow is another day.”
“You don’t seem worried, sir.”
“Why would I be worried?” Calderon sounded puzzled.
“Well, they haven’t taken any proof of life from you, even though you’ve been here for weeks. And then our team got snatched. Tyr probably sent in another unit, but they have no way of finding us…” Flores’s voice trailed off.
There was a long moment of silence before Calderon spoke. “I’ve been doing this a long time, Enrique. There’s no fixed playbook for negotiations.”
“Yeah, but by now—”
“I’m too valuable for them to risk losing,” Calderon interrupted.
He sounded so sure of himself that Flores hated to burst his bubble. “But, sir. The rest of us—I mean, the way it went down. It seems like someone told them to expect us.”
“You’re implying that someone at Tyr doesn’t want me released,” Calderon said.
“It had occurred to me, sir.”
“It’s not outside the realm of possibility.” Calderon seemed to weigh his words before continuing. “The same thought had occurred to me. But if someone at Tyr conspired to get me out of the way, then why am I still alive?”
It was a good question, one Flores didn’t have the answer to. “It just seems like something else is going on here, sir.”
“Something else is always going on.” Calderon shifted onto his side, facing away from Flores. “It’s late, go to sleep. Dreams are the only respite from this place.”
Flores lay still for a long time, looking up at the stars through a gap in the plastic tarp. He thought again of Maryanne, wondered if she could feel the baby kicking yet. As he drifted off, the radio clicked back on next door, the steady murmur of despair lulling him to sleep.
“I can’t believe you’re doing this.” Kelly lay on the bed, facing away from Jake. It wasn’t cold in their motel room, but she clutched the sheets to her anyway.
“Kel, I’ve got to. There’s no other way.”
He reached out and rubbed her shoulder. She didn’t respond to his touch.
“So I’ll stay, too,” she said.
He hesitated before answering. “You can’t.”
“We’ve been through this before—”
“This time is different,” he said. “We’re going into the jungle. It’s going to be a lot of trekking across rough terrain.”
“I can manage,” Kelly protested.
“Not in the shape you’re in, and we both know it.”
“This is because Syd doesn’t think I can handle it.”
“No, it’s because even if you were healthy, I wouldn’t want you along. It’s just too dangerous. Hell, I don’t even want to go,” Jake said wearily. “And if something happened to you, I’d never be able to forgive myself.”
Kelly threw off the covers and sat up. Her left foot landed on the carpet. She avoided looking at where the stump of her right leg ended at the edge of the bed.
Jake wrapped his arms around her from behind. She let him, but remained rigid. He buried his face in her hair anyway. “When you were in that hospital bed last summer, all I could think was that I wasn’t there to protect you.”
“I don’t need protecting.”
“Bullshit. Sometimes we all need it.”
“Well, you won’t be there to protect me if you go,” Kelly said. “What if something happens to you?”
“If you tell me not to go, I’ll stay.”
Kelly debated. When it came down to it, she really didn’t want Jake to go. This was the craziest thing she’d ever heard of, the group of them heading off into the jungle, trying to chase down an army of well-trained mercenaries. Heright to call it a suicide mission.
By the same token, Kelly knew that if she stopped him, and something happened to Mark, Jake would never forgive her. Not even if it meant he survived. Every time he looked at her, he’d be seeing his dead brother. And although she felt guilty admitting it, Jake’s departure left her free to pursue her own case.
“Go with your brother,” she said.
“Kelly…”
“But don’t get yourself killed,” she said fiercely.
“I won’t. I promise.”
He pulled her back down on top of him. Kelly buried her face in his chest, felt the steady rhythm of his heartbeat against her ear. She tilted her head to kiss his neck. Jake’s breath quickened as she nuzzled his ear, then nibbled his lower lip.
“I don’t know if we have time,” he said, glancing toward the clock.
Kelly didn’t answer. She moved forward, breasts inches from his lips. Lifted her hips and drew him into her. His lips parted and he let out a small gasp. “Oh, God…”
Kelly started slowly. It had been so long, and it felt so good that for the moment she forgot about her leg, forgot about him leaving, forgot about the way she sometimes caught Syd looking at him. For now, he was all hers.
He arched his pelvis up, matching her movement. Put his hands on her hips to guide her, driving her faster. Kelly let her head fall back. As they got close she leaned forward again, her body lined up with his, lips inches from his mouth.
“You’re so beautiful,” he said. “I love you so much.”
Kelly didn’t answer, just watched as he threw his head back and moaned. One way or another, she knew this was goodbye.
