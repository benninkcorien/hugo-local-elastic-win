Twenty-Four
As she stepped outside, Kelly felt the pressure in her chest ease. She inhaled deeply—even the smog tasted good after stale prison air. “Thanks, Rodriguez. I owe you one.”
“You owe me a hell of a lot more than one,” he grumbled good-naturedly. “Did you know that seventy percent of the cops in this town only made it to third grade? They’re not a fun bunch to deal with.”
“What did you tell them?”
“I told them you were a hardened criminal who was already wanted for similar crimes in the U.S., and that we’d make sure you never saw daylight again.”
Kelly examined his face to see if he was kidding.
He shrugged. “Hey, it worked, right? Part of the deal was that I get you on the first flight out. So let’s grab a cab.”
Kelly sifted through her backpack to make sure everything was still there. Her wallet was shy a few hundred pesos, and her pill bottle was gone. That would usually send her into a panic, but for some reason the actually made her feel calmer. She still had enough cash to get by for a few days. Her expensive new cell phone was gone, too. She considered trying to get it back, but thought better of it. Chances were she wouldn’t need it anyway. “I can’t go.”
Rodriguez breathed out hard, sending his lips flapping. “I knew it.”
“We have to head to the dump and interview some of the people living there. One of them might know where Stefan is.”
“Absolutely not.” Rodriguez’s grip was firm on her elbow as he steered her toward the curb. “You get caught again, I doubt they’ll let you out. And they’ll probably throw me in there with you.”
“You don’t have to come,” Kelly said. “You can go back, try to persuade McLarty to send backup.”
“I told you, Jones, I already ran it by him. He can’t spare anyone right now.”
“He didn’t believe me, did he?” Rodriguez didn’t answer. Kelly stared him down, but he didn’t shrink under her gaze. He had grown up, she realized. Which probably didn’t bode well for her. “I’m telling you, he’s here,” she insisted.
“Jones, you’ve been through a lot the past seven months. I mean, with the accident—”
“It wasn’t an accident. My leg got blown off by a grenade,” she retorted.
Rodriguez shifted, clearly uncomfortable. “Anyway, you’ve been under a lot of stress.”
“Not enough to make me start seeing things, Rodriguez. We never found Stefan’s body.”
“The M.E. thought it probably got caught under something in the river.”
Kelly blew out air, exasperated. “It’s been three years…don’t you think some sort of remains would have turned up by now? Didn’t you see the report last fall from the P.I. the Kaishens hired? Stefan’s money ended up here.”
Rodriguez sighed. “I knew I shouldn’t have gotten you those files. That case isn’t even technically ours. If the field office in charge didn’t follow up on it, there was probably a reason.”
“They didn’t even bother looking into it. Maybe because he wasn’t stateside anymore, so ASAC Bowen figured he could shunt the problem off on Mexico.”
“C’mon, Kelly. You don’t honestly believe—”
“I’m telling you, the P.I. was right. Somehow Stefan survived the shooting and came here. And now he’s killing people again. What he did to that kid was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen.”
“I know. The comandante showed me the pictures.”
“So?” Kelly asked. “You want to just let him keep doing that?”
She could see him weighing what she’d said. “We don’t have any jurisdiction here.”
“I know
“You’re not officially on duty right now. And I’m supposed to be back in L.A. by tomorrow morning. I could catch hell for getting involved in this.”
“Then get on a plane.” Kelly marched away from him, headed into the throng of people. It was twilight, the streets were packed. Horns blared as cars pumped out choking clouds of exhaust. She felt Rodriguez at her shoulder.
“Don’t be like that, Jones. You know if there was any way—”
“I know. Listen, you’ve done enough.” She raised her hand to flag down a cab. It inched through the traffic toward the curb. “I’ll be fine. Just do me a favor. If I don’t make it home, tell Jake what happened.”
“Christ, don’t say that.”
The cab parked at an angle. Kelly opened the door and awkwardly climbed in, dragging her bad leg behind her. She leaned over to pull the door shut. “Goodbye, Danny.”
He half raised a hand in a wave.
The cab edged back into traffic. They’d gone less than five feet when someone banged on the trunk. The passenger-side door was flung open, and Rodriguez clambered inside.
“I’m going to regret this,” he grumbled.
“I said you didn’t have to come.” Kelly had to fight to repress a grin. Despite her bravado, she hadn’t been optimistic about tracking down Stefan without assistance.
“I’ve heard your Spanish, Jones. You couldn’t get help finding the bathroom.”
“Thanks.” She settled back into the seat and gazed at the orange moon hovering over the volcano on the city’s edge. For the first time that day, she had a good feeling.
Jake nearly fell again. They’d had an easier time making their way back through the jungle, maybe because this time they knew where they were headed. It was less damp than before, too, making it less slippery. Still, his boots were already soaked through.
It felt good to be on the move doing something, however. Syd and Mark had been exchanging terse radio communications all afternoon. Apparently Isabela’s tip about the rival cartel raid had panned out, confirmed by some guy the Tyr group was holding prisoner. Jake had decided that the less he knew about that, the better. After this experience in the field, working the office side of the K&R business was suddenly vastly more appealing.
Syd and Mark figured that the ensuing confusion would be their best shot at springing Calderon and Flores. Apparently there hadn’t been enough time to track down Isabela’s father, or the Tyr spy simply hadn’t bothered. Her jaw had tightened at the news, but Mark assured her that he’d personally go in after him. It had been tough to convince Isabela to remain at the motel, but on that point Syd refused to budge. Jake couldn’t blame her for that. He wasn’t as innately suspicious as she was, but something about Isabela’s story was a little too convenient.
Jake wasn’t holding out much hope that they’d be able to save any of the prisoners. Still, the plan had evolved from a suicidmission to one where it was only extremely likely they’d all be killed. So things were looking up.
He hadn’t been able to get in touch with Kelly. She should already be back in New York. It worried him that she wasn’t answering either their home phone or her cell. With any luck they’d be across the border by sunrise, and he’d arrive home tomorrow afternoon. Jake hadn’t decided yet what to tell her about the incident with Syd. In reality, his cheating unearthed a much larger problem in their relationship. And the time had probably come for both of them to face it.
Of course, there was a good chance he wouldn’t survive long enough to have to deal with it. It was an oddly comforting thought.
Jake pushed it out of his mind. Right now, he had to focus on the task at hand—getting through this jungle maze without being shot. He was following Fribush’s wide back. Syd was ahead of him, with Jagerson bringing up the rear. The strap of an AK-47 chafed his shoulder. Under the Kevlar vest, sweat pooled down his back.
Kane and Maltz were still in Mexico City scrounging up supplies. Hopefully they’d make it back in time for the raid. Their plan required a few dozen well-trained men—at the moment, they had twenty. And after their earlier experience with the Tyr team, Jake wasn’t ruling out the possibility of friendly fire.
Fribush suddenly stopped and dropped to one knee. Jake did the same, breath catching in his chest. The bushes ahead of them parted.
“Don’t shoot,” a voice called out. Mark materialized, Decker at his heels. He looked exhausted, Jake noted, but had that familiar glimmer in his eyes, as if they were about to light the wick of a cherry bomb. He saw Jake and smiled. “Glad you came,” he said. “Brown’s unit is back this way.”
Jake fell in step behind him. The fact that for the first time Mark seemed happy to see him raised a lump in his throat. He reminded himself why he was angry with him, but for some reason none of that seemed to matter anymore. They were partnered up again for the first time since they were kids. He had to admit, it felt good. The truth was, he’d missed him.
They followed Mark a quarter mile into deeper undergrowth. Branches tore at Jake’s face and hands as he pushed through them.
Suddenly they emerged in a small clearing packed with men checking weapons. They all stopped to examine the newcomers. Judging by their expressions, many weren’t thrilled with the new partnership arrangement.
Jake recognized Ellis Brown from their earlier confrontation. He was standing over a guy tied to a tree. The guy’s head hung forward, face covered in blood. At the sight of them Brown broke into a smile and approached, arms held wide.
“So the Littlehorn group is here.”
“Longhorn,” Jake corrected him.
“He’s messing with us, Jake,” Syd said. “Enemy of my enemy is my friend, right, Brown?”
“I’ll take what I can get out here.” He gestured to their rifles. “I figured you were the ones who bought up every AK-47 in town.”
“You know me…I’ve never been a girl to pass up a good sale.” She tucked a s blond hair behind her ear.
“Any more where those came from?”
“I might be able to spare a few,” she said coyly.
In fact, Fribush had a duffel bag filled with them slung over his back. They had decided as a unit to hold on to the weapons until they were certain Tyr wasn’t planning some sort of bait and switch.
Syd jerked her head toward the prisoner. “So he confirms the cartel raid rumor?”
“Yup. And a couple of my guys scouted the far side of the camp. A few clicks southeast they spotted at least a hundred men hanging around waiting for something. And I doubt it’s a Shakira concert.”
“Any idea what time they’re moving in?”
“This guy doesn’t have any idea—believe me, if he knew he would have told us. Riley says the shift change happens around midnight, so that would be my guess. But we thought there might be an easier way to find out for sure.” Brown’s eyes drifted over to Jake.
“What?” Jake asked. The way Brown was regarding him induced a distinctly bad feeling.
“Apparently the Zetas snatched Cesar because they want to strike a deal with him,” Brown said. “My guy didn’t have time to get the details. But we were thinking that you could approach the Sinaloa cartel, offer them something similar.”
“You want me to make a deal with a drug cartel? For what?”
“Clients,” Mark replied. “Tell them you’ll offer inside information on who they should target.”
“That’s insane. I’d never do that.”
“Neither would Cesar, that’s why he’s rotting down there,” Brown growled.
Jake’s head reeled. “You want me to approach a group of armed soldiers who are about to raid their rival’s prison camp and offer them a deal? They’ll shoot me on sight.”
“I doubt it,” Brown said. “They’ll be curious enough to hear you out first. Probably. And we’ll have a few snipers in the bushes covering you. Truth be told, the Sinaloans don’t strike me as the A-Team. I’m kind of doubting they’ll manage to take the camp.”
“So why contact them at all?” Jake asked.
“It’s a good idea, actually,” Syd said. “Makes it less likely they’ll shoot at us. And we’ll be approaching from the other side. Having us on board actually improves their chances. If the bosses over there are savvy, they’ll understand that.”
“No way,” Jake said. “I’m not making a deal with those guys.”
He caught Mark looking at him with disapproval and felt a flare of rage. All the good feelings he’d had a second earlier dissipated. He wondered if Mark had even blinked when Brown suggested Jake risk his life.
“I’ll go,” Syd said.
Jake shook his head. “Not this time, Syd. Longhorn bongs to both of us. We’re not going to compromise it.”
“What about Calderon and Flores?” Mark demanded. “They don’t deserve to be shot in a pen in the middle of the jungle. Isabela’s father, too.”
“Sorry, but there’s no way. It’s a bad idea.”
“Jake—” Syd laid a hand on his arm.
He shrugged it off. “I’m not letting you talk me into it. You want to take part in this raid, fine. But not like this.”
Jake could see her looking for an angle that would convince him. “Okay,” she finally said. “We’ll do it your way. But it’s a hell of a lot more dangerous.”
“So be it.” Jake turned to Brown. “I’m guessing you’ve still got men watching the other cartel?”
Brown looked at Syd as if asking approval, then slowly nodded. “They’ll radio in as soon as the Sinaloans start to move.”
“All right, then. And you know where Calderon and…what’s his name?”
“Flores,” Mark said heavily.
“Right, Flores. So you know where they are. The minute we find out the raid is on, we head in. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to free them during the initial confusion. We’ve got two more men coming with heavier artillery, hopefully they’ll get here in time.”
“If that’s how you want to play it,” Brown said. “I still think—”
“I don’t care what you think,” Jake interrupted. “You want to use my people and our resources, those are the terms.”
“Agreed,” an unfamiliar voice chimed in. A small, weaselly man emerged from behind a tree. He walked forward, hand extended. “Linus Smiley, vice president of the Tyr Group.”
Jake eyed the extended hand, then ignored it. “So are we all on the same page?”
Smiley started to reply, but Brown interrupted. “Yeah, why not.”
“All right, then.”
A soldier trotted up to Brown and said something in a low voice. Brown’s face darkened, and he swore.
“Now what?” Syd asked.
“Wysocki got away,” he said to Mark.
“Who the hell is Wysocki?” Jake asked.
“No time for that.” Mark slung his LMT back over his shoulder, face grim. “We can’t let him get down to camp to warn them.”
