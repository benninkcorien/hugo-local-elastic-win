Forty-Five
Stefan stepped off the gunwale and into the boat. Keeping an eye on Jake, he untied the bowline, casting off. The boat drifted away from the dock.
“Stop him!” Jake called out. A few curious tourists looked his way, probably thinking this was part of the show.
“Dude,” the kid said. “What’s the issue?”
“Get out of here,” Jake said roughly, shoving him back. “Get clear of the docks. Go!”
“Chill, man.” Shaking his head, the kid tucked his phone away and moved off, muttering under his breath.
The crowd was dispersing: still, Jake found his way blocked. His attempts to push through were met with nasty looks and curses in several languages. Entire families grinned wide as they posed for pictures in front of the docked trajineras.
Jake watched helplessly as Stefan drifted down the canal.
“Hey, he’s stealing a boat!” someone yelled. A cheer went up.
By the time Jake arrived at the edge of the dock, the boat had drifted too far away for him to reach. Stefan cocked a hand in a little wave, then crossed his arms over his chest as he floated downstream.
“Crap,” Jake muttered. He got on his belly and peerhe dock. Nothing but boards. He braced his hands along the edge and scooted forward until his upper torso hung all the way off.
“Cuidado!” a voice cautioned from behind him.
Craning his head from side to side, he spotted cord wrapped around a bundle on the pier’s concrete piling. It extended away to the next dock support, then the next. Jake looked in the other direction and saw the same thing. Probably Primacord, a type of fuse that detonated explosives in sequence. Used in mining, it was easy to get hold of and worked even when wet. The closest length of cord was set too far back for him to reach.
He had to get the docks clear before they blew. Jake waved his arms and yelled, “Bomb! Bomba!”
A few tourists examined him curiously, but no one moved. Either the bulk of the crowd didn’t speak English, or they thought he was just another nut trying to get attention.
“Get off the docks, there’s a bomb!” he yelled again.
Stefan’s boat had come to rest in the middle of the canal, about twenty yards downriver. Looking back at Jake, he raised both hands toward the sky as if in supplication.
Jake jumped into the water. He broke the surface and swam to the nearest piling.
It took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the gloom. Once they did, he saw a bundle of dynamite bound to the piling with Primacord. If he cut the wire, it should stop the sequence. He’d slice each one, trying to make it back to the source before they ignited. Primacord burned fast, the detonations would only be seconds apart. And if he was close to one when it blew…
There was no other option. The detonating cord stretched away from him, extending into the shadows beneath the dock like a grim clothesline.
Unfortunately it was just out of reach overhead. Jake scissored his legs together, propelling himself out of the water as he grabbed for the cord. He missed, and fell back in with a splash. Grunting, he tried again. This time his fingers latched on. He pulled the line down to the surface of the water as he fell. It cut into his hands, and he swore.
Suddenly a bright flash to his right drove away the shadows. Jake’s retinas burned from the glare. An explosion, then the sound of something large hitting the water. Screams and panicked feet running above him. A spark danced along the fuse a dozen yards away, approaching as fast as a train.
Jake frantically sawed at the cord. Another explosion to his right. More screams, followed by another crash. He didn’t dare look at the swath of destruction racing toward him. In his panic, the knife kept slipping. He slashed his thumb, winced, but kept going. The final strands were separating.
Just then, fire darted into his line of vision and the cord suddenly burned hot. His fingers reacted, dropping it in the water.
The piling ten feet away exploded. Jake was momentarily stunned by the blast. The boards above him rolled and split. An instant later an enormous wave lifted him up, slamming him hard against the underside of the dock before sweeping him away.
Upriver there was a boom, followed by a series of similar percussions. It sounded like firecracks. Kelly froze.
“Mierda,” Landa spat.
A wave appeared around the bend.
Landa issued orders to his men, then turned to Kelly and yelled, “Hold on.”
The wake lifted the boat up, the propellers churned air. Kelly clutched the siderails, fighting to keep her balance. As the skiff slammed back down in the water, the propellers caught. The boat bucked wildly from side to side, nearly capsizing. The cop at the wheel powered down the throttle, shouting as he tried to keep them afloat.
The waters surrounding them stilled.
“What happened?” Kelly asked.
Landa ignored her, calling out another command. The boat accelerated again, jetting upstream.
The canal ahead was clotted with debris. The driver slowed the boat as they approached it. Kelly recognized brightly painted wood from trajineras, now in jagged pieces. More boards, plain this time. A shoe. As they passed it, Kelly was horrified to see a leg, but no body.
“Oh my God,” she said. “We’re too late.”
