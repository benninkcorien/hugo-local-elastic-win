Eleven
Kelly stood next to Jake, watching the Tyr team mobilize. They were organizing in almost complete silence, as if the assignments were being transmitted telepathically. She had to admit they looked impressive. Matching uniforms, even. Two of them stood guard over the guy who had climbed out of the van.
“They’re taking him?”
“Looks like it,” Jake said.
“What are we going to do about it?”
“I’m still working on that,” Jake said. His cell phone rang. He fumbled with it, frowning at the caller ID.
“Who is it?” Kelly asked.
“Work.”
“What, now?”
He shrugged. “Must be important. They’re not supposed to bother me unless something directly related to the case comes in.”
Jake stepped away to answer it. While he was speaking, Syd joined her. They watched as the survivor’s hands were zip tied behind his back. “How’d Tyr get the jump on you two?” she asked without looking at Kelly.
“They came up from behind while we were waiting for you.”
“Huh,” Syd said. “I gotta have a chat with Maltz about that.”
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” Kelly said defensively. “There were too many of them. Anyway, we were handling it before you
“Sure you were,” Syd said. “You had everything under control.”
Kelly was about to retort but Syd had already turned away, eyes narrowed.
The Tyr team was melting back into the spaces between buildings. Two of them cradled the injured team member in their arms. Two others escorted the new captive away. The rest were gathered around Brown. Syd marched over to him. Warily, Kelly followed.
“Going somewhere?” Syd asked, arms crossed.
“Even in this neighborhood, the federales will show up at some point,” Brown said without bothering to look at her. “Time to move out.”
“Bullshit,” Syd said. “You’re sharing him.”
“Or what, your team will take us out?” He smirked. “I think that ship sailed, Clement.”
“This is ridiculous,” Kelly said. “If we pool resources, we all get what we want.”
“Who’s your friend?” Brown asked, finally making eye contact.
“FBI,” Syd said dismissively.
“That explains it,” Brown said. “Didn’t realize they were making them cuter.”
“She’s engaged.” Syd jerked her head toward Jake. “To him.”
“Yeah?” Brown eyed Kelly. “I don’t see it.”
“I know, right?”
“Excuse me?” Kelly interrupted. “Can we finish discussing what we’re going to do here?”
