Chapter 3
CHAPTER THREE
The drive took Austin past the Port Gamble S’Klallam casino, through Poulsbo—a city known for its Viking-themed parade, stunning views of the Olympics, and legendary donut shop—and along a pretty stretch of highway into Silverdale. He’d lived in the area for a little over a year and still couldn’t get used to all the green. It was a few days until Christmas and the trees were a deep shade of green and stretched as far as he could see on both sides of the highway. In the distance, snow-capped mountains peered out from behind thin clouds.
When he’d left the NYPD, he’d moved west for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was to get away from cases like the one that led to the arrest of Lorraine D’Antonia. Every detective who’d been on the job for a decade or two had The One. A case that made their career, defined their career, or, in some cases, destroyed their career. Austin’s One was the serial murder case of Lorraine D’Antonia or, as the New York City tabloids had branded her, “The Holiday Baby Butcher.”
The case hadn’t made his career—he was already one of the top detectives in the NYPD when it landed on his desk. It hadn’t destroyed his career, either. His career hadn’t been destroyed until a Tuesday in September, when two gunmen opened fire on Austin and his wife as they strolled out of an Upper East Side steakhouse on their tenth wedding anniversary. He’d caught four bullets and lived. Fiona, an assistant DA for Manhattan County, had been struck once in the head and died at the scene. He still wasn’t sure—no one was because the case remained unsolved—but Austin assumed all the bullets had been meant for her.
No, the Lorraine D’Antonia case hadn’t been the one to make or break his career, but it was the one that haunted him more than any other. D’Antonia had grown up in Seattle in the seventies and eighties and worked as a travel nurse for twenty years before returning home. Her first victim was Johnathan Gruber, a three-week old whom she’d stolen in the dead of night three days before the Fourth of July, 2014. On July 5th, his bones were found in a decorative bag—red, white, and blue, complete with stars and stripes—next to Green Lake in Seattle. She’d committed four more murders over the next two years: Thanksgiving of 2014, Christmas of 2014, Easter of 2015, and Thanksgiving of 2015. After that she’d gone dark.
She’d popped up again three years later in New York, Austin’s territory. Her victim was tiny Sonya Lopez, a premature baby who’d only been home from the hospital for six days when D’Antonia stole her. The little girl’s bones were found the day after Christmas, stuffed into a felt Christmas gift bag decorated with a jolly Santa Claus. That was her first murder in New York.
It was also her last.
Coordinating with the Seattle Police and the FBI, Austin had led the team that eventually apprehended D’Antonia. A negotiation above Austin’s pay grade had led to D’Antonia being sent back to Seattle to stand trial and, for the last twenty-six months, she’d been exactly where she belonged: rotting behind bars in the maximum-security wing of the Washington Corrections Center for Women.
Austin parked his truck in front of the Kitsap Sheriff’s Office, a two-story building that looked a lot like a regular house, complete with a Christmas tree sparkling with silver tinsel and lights visible through the glass door. The only evidence it was a law enforcement office was the huge Sheriff’s star stenciled on a wide window facing the parking lot.
As he approached the door, a car pulled in behind him. A man hopped out and strode toward him wearing black jeans, a blue blazer, and a smile that showed absolutely zero warmth.
“You Thomas Austin?” He called, hurrying up to him and extending a hand. He was tall, around Austin’s height, but stouter, with a round face with red, fleshy cheeks that made Austin think he was a heavy drinker.
Austin held out a hand to shake. “That’s me.”
“Sheriff Grayson Daniels. Detective Calvin told me you might be dropping by.”
“Ahh. Good to meet you. I told him I’d talk through the old case. Tell him what I know.”
The Sheriff’s smile had faded, his lips forming a tight line. “You’re the one who bought the Hansville Café, right?”
“And general store and bait shop, yeah.”
“Right out from under me. Flew in from New York and just grabbed it right up, didn’t you, Mr. Moneybags?”
Austin cocked his head to the side. Was this guy serious? He’d driven half an hour in the middle of the day to talk about a case he’d never wanted to think about again. And now this? “I’m sorry, were you trying to buy it, too?”
“Damn right I was.”
Austin stepped back. This guy’s breath smelled both of whiskey and the mint mouthwash he’d used to try to cover up the whiskey. “My real estate lady never said anything about… I mean, I just put in an offer, they accepted, and I moved.”
“Well, no hard feelings. My wife and I had saved a long time, hoping to buy that café for her and, well, I guess we couldn’t all compete with New York money.”
As a Navy brat, Austin had grown up all over, but his twenty years in New York had taught him how valuable a frosty glare could be. He offered one of his coldest to Sheriff Daniels. “Can I help you?” He’d purchased the building with money from Fiona’s death benefit and the pension he got for early retirement after taking four bullets. Not that he was going to tell this bastard any of that.
Sheriff Daniels cleared his throat. “Well, water under the bridge now.” He pushed open the door and led Austin into the building. They stopped in the foyer. “Now listen, Austin, I told Detective Calvin we don’t need any outside help on this, especially since this looks like a copycat.”
“It is a copycat. Unless Lorraine D’Antonia escaped and it didn’t make the news.”
Sheriff Daniels offered a polite chuckle. “She’s very much behind bars. In fact, Ridley interviewed her last week.” He waved a hand at nothing. “I’m sure he’ll tell you about it.”
“I imagine so.”
Sheriff Daniels pointed down a hallway. “Second door on the right.” He turned to go, then stopped himself. “One more thing, former Detective Austin. I’ve heard you used to play it fast and loose from time to time. We do things a little slower out here. By the book. You sure you got the right woman?”
Was this guy for real? Austin spoke through gritted teeth. “Lorraine D’Antonia was convicted of four murders. In your courts. Yeah, I’m pretty sure we got her.”
“Well, like I told Ridley, fine by me if you want to help out—”
“I don’t want to help out.”
“Alright, alright. Well, thanks for coming out to chat with Ridley. He’s the best detective we have, so if he’s stumped…” He leveled the most serious look he could muster on Austin. “Just make sure you don’t go breaking any eggs that belong in the crate.”
It wasn’t an expression Austin had heard before, but he got the point. Sheriff Daniels was only five or six months out from the beginning of his next election campaign. He didn’t want any bad press, especially in a high-profile case. Of course, in Austin’s mind, it was worth cracking eggs—and skulls—to get people like Lorraine D’Antonia off the street.
As he knocked on the door to Ridley’s office, all he could think about was how he’d left his job, traveled three thousand miles across the country, and he was still eating shit from a commanding officer.
