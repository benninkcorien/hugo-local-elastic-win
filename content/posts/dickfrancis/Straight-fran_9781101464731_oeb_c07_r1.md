Brad came early on Wednesday and drove me to Lambourn. The ankle was sore in spite of Distalgesic but less of a constant drag that morning and I could have driven the car myself if I’d put my mind to it. Having Brad around, I reflected on the way, was a luxury I was all too easily getting used to.
Clarissa Williams’s attentions had worn off completely except for a little stiffness and a blackening bruise like a bar midway between shoulder and elbow. That didn’t matter. For much of the year I had bruises somewhere or other, result of the law of averages operating in steeplechasing. Falls occurred about once every fourteen races, sometimes oftener, and while a few of the jockeys had bodies that hardly seemed to bruise at all, mine always did. On the other hand I healed everywhere fast, bones, skin and optimism.
Milo Shandy, striding about in his stable yard as if incapable of standing still, came over to my car as it rolled to a stop and yanked open the driver’s door. The words he was about to say didn’t come out as he stared first at Brad, then at me on the back seat, and what he eventually said was, “A chauffeur, by God. Coddling yourself, aren’t you?”
Brad got out of the car, gave Milo a Neanderthal look and handed me the crutches as usual.
Milo, dark, short and squarely built, watched the proceedings with disgust.
“I want you to ride Datepalm,” he said.
“Well, I can’t.”
“The Ostermeyers will want it. I told them you’d be here.”
“Gerry rides Datepalm perfectly well,” I said, Gerry being the lad who rode the horse at exercise as a matter of course most days of the week.
“Gerry isn’t you.”
“He’s better than me with a groggy ankle.”
Milo glared. “Do you want to keep the horse here or don’t you?”
I did.
Milo and I spent a fair amount of time arguing at the best of times. He was pugnacious by nature, mercurial by temperament, full of instant opinions that could be reversed the next day, didactic, dynamic and outspoken. He believed absolutely in his own judgment and was sure that everything would turn out all right in the end. He was moderately tactful to the owners, hard on his work force and full of swearwords for his horses, which he produced as winners by the dozen.
I’d been outraged by the way he’d often spoken to me when I first started to ride for him three years earlier, but one day I lost my temper and yelled back at him and he burst out laughing and told me we would get along just fine, which in fact we did, though seldom on the surface.
I knew people thought ours an unlikely alliance, I neat and quiet, he restless and flamboyant, but in fact I liked the way he trained horses and they seemed to run well for him, and we had both prospered.
The Ostermeyers arrived at that point and they too had a chauffeur, which Milo took for granted. The bullishness at once disappeared from his manner to be replaced by the jocular charm that had owners regularly mesmerized, that morning being no exception. The Ostermeyers responded  immediately, she with a roguish wiggle of the hips, he with a big handshake and a wide smile.
They were not so delighted about my crutches.
“Oh dear,” Martha Ostermeyer exclaimed in dismay. “What have you done? Don’t say you can’t ride Datepalm. We only came, you know, because dear Milo said you’d be here to ride it.”
“He’ll ride it,” Milo said before I had a chance of answering, and Martha Ostermeyer clapped her small gloved hands with relief.
“If we’re going to buy him,” she said, smiling, “we want to see him with his real jockey up, not some exercise rider.”
Harley Ostermeyer nodded in agreement, benignly.
Not really my week, I thought.
The Ostermeyers were all sweetness and light while people were pleasing them, and I’d never had any trouble liking them, but I’d also seen Harley Ostermeyer’s underlying streak of ruthless viciousness once in a racecourse car-park where he’d verbally reduced to rubble an attendant who had allowed someone to park behind him, closing him in. He had had to wait half an hour. The attendant had looked genuinely scared. “Goodnight, Derek,” he’d croaked as I went past, and Ostermeyer had whirled round and cooled his temper fifty percent, inviting my sympathy in his trouble. Harley Ostermeyer liked to be thought a good guy, most of the time. He was the boss, as I understood it, of a giant supermarket chain. Martha Ostermeyer was also rich, a fourth-generation multimillionaire in banking. I’d ridden for them often in the past years and been well rewarded, because generosity was one of their pleasures.
Milo drove them and me up to the Downs where Datepalm and the other horses were already circling, having walked up earlier. The day was bright and chilly, the Downs rolling away to the horizon, the sky clear, the horses’ coats glossy in the sun. A perfect day for buying a champion ‘chaser.
Milo sent three other horses down to the bottom of the  gallop to work fast so that the Ostermeyers would know where to look and what to expect when Datepalm came up and passed them. They stood out on the grass, looking where Milo pointed, intent and happy.
Milo had brought a spare helmet with us in the big-wheeled vehicle that rolled over the mud and ruts on the Downs, and with an inward sigh I put it on. The enterprise was stupid really, as my leg wasn’t strong enough and if anything wild happened to upset Datepalm, he might get loose and injure himself and we’d lose him surely one way or another.
On the other hand, I’d ridden races now and then with cracked bones, not just exercise gallops, and I knew one jockey who in the past had broken three bones in his foot and won races with it, sitting with it in an ice bucket in the changing room between times and literally hopping out to the parade ring, supported by friends. The authorities had later brought in strict medical rules to stop that sort of thing as being unfair to the betting public, but one could still get away with it sometimes.
Milo saw me slide out of the vehicle with the helmet on and came over happily and said, “I knew you would.”
“Mm,” I said. “When you give me a leg up, put both hands round my knee and be careful, because if you twist my foot there’ll be no sale.”
“You’re such a wimp,” he said.
Nevertheless he was circumspect and I landed in the saddle with little trouble. I was wearing jeans, and that morning for the first time I’d managed to get a shoe on, or rather one of the wide soft black leather moccasins I used as bedroom slippers. Milo threaded the stirrup over the moccasin with unexpected gentleness and I wondered if he were having last-minute doubts about the wisdom of all this.
One look at the Ostermeyers’ faces dispelled both his doubts and mine. They were beaming at Datepalm already with proprietary pride.
Certainly he looked good. He filled the eye, as they say. A bay with black points, excellent head, short sturdy  legs with plenty of bone. The Ostermeyers always preferred handsome animals, perhaps because they were handsome themselves, and Datepalm was well-mannered besides, which made him a peach of a ride.
He and I and two others from the rest of the string set off at a walk toward the far end of the gallop but were presently trotting, which I achieved by standing in the stirrups with all my weight on my right foot while cursing Milo imaginatively for the sensations in my left. Datepalm, who knew how horses should be ridden, which was not lopsided like this, did a good deal of head and tail shaking but otherwise seemed willing to trust me. He and I knew each other well as I’d ridden him in all his races for the past three years. Horses had no direct way of expressing recognition, but occasionally he would turn his head to look at me when he heard my voice, and I also thought he might know me by scent as he would put his muzzle against my neck sometimes and make small whiffling movements of his nostrils. In any case we did have a definite rapport and that morning it stood us in good stead.
At the far end the two lads and I sorted out our three horses ready to set off at a working gallop back toward Milo and the Ostermeyers, a pace fast enough to be interesting but not flat out like racing.
There wasn’t much finesse in riding a gallop to please customers, one simply saw to it that one was on their side of the accompanying horses, to give them a clear view of the merchandise, and that one finished in front to persuade them that that’s what would happen in the future.
Walking him around to get in position, I chatted quietly as I often did to Datepalm, because in common with many racehorses he was always reassured by a calm human voice, sensing from one’s tone that all was well. Maybe horses heard the lower resonances: one never knew.
“Just go up there like a pro,” I told him, “because I don’t want to lose you, you old bugger. I want us to win the National one day, so shine, boy. Dazzle. Do your bloody best.”
I shook up the reins as we got the horses going, and in fact Datepalm put up one of his smoothest performances, staying with his companions for most of the journey, lengthening his stride when I gave him the signal, coming away alone and then sweeping collectedly past the Ostermeyers with fluid power; and if the jockey found it an acutely stabbing discomfort all the way, it was a fair price for the result. Even before I’d pulled up, the Ostermeyers had bought the horse and shaken hands on the deal.
“Subject to a veterinarian’s report, of course,” Harley was saying as I walked Datepalm back to join them. “Otherwise, he’s superb.”
Milo’s smile looked as if it would split his face. He held the reins while Martha excitedly patted the new acquisition, and went on holding them while I took my feet out of the stirrups and lowered myself very carefully to the ground, hopping a couple of steps to where the crutches lay on the grass.
“What did you do to your foot?” Martha asked unworriedly.
“Wrenched it,” I said, slipping the arm cuffs on with relief. “Very boring.”
She smiled, nodded and patted my arm. “Milo said it was nothing much.”
Milo gave me a gruesome look, handed Datepalm back to his lad, Gerry, and helped the Ostermeyers into the big-wheeled vehicle for the drive home. We bumped down the tracks and I took off the helmet and ran my fingers through my hair, reflecting that although I wouldn’t care to ride gallops like that every day of the week, I would do it again for as good an outcome.
We all went into Milo’s house for breakfast, a ritual there as in many other racing stables, and over coffee, toast and scrambled eggs Milo and the Ostermeyers planned Datepalm’s future program, including all the top races with of course another crack at the Gold Cup.
“What about the Grand National?” Martha said, her eyes like stars.
“Well, now, we’ll have to see,” Milo said, but his dreams too were as visible as searchlights. First thing on our return, he’d telephoned to Datepalm’s former owner and got confirmation that she agreed to the sale and was pleased by it, and since then one had almost needed to pull him down from the ceiling with a string, like a helium-filled balloon. My own feelings weren’t actually much lower. Datepalm really was a horse to build dreams on.
After the food and a dozen repetitions of the horse’s virtues Milo told the Ostermeyers about my inheriting Dozen Roses and about the probate saga, which seemed to fascinate them. Martha sat up straighter and exclaimed, “Did you say York?”
Milo nodded.
“Do you mean this Saturday? Why, Harley and I are going to York races on Saturday, aren’t we, Harley?”
Harley agreed that they were. “Our dear friends Lord and Lady Knightwood have asked us to lunch.”
Martha said, “Why don’t we give Derek a ride up there to see his horse run? What do you say, Harley?”
“Be glad to have you along,” Harley said to me genuinely. “Don’t give us no for an answer.”
I looked at their kind, insistent faces and said lamely, “I thought of going by train, if I went at all.”
“No, no,” Martha said. “Come to London by train and we’ll go up together. Do say you will.”
Milo was looking at me anxiously: pleasing the Ostermeyers was still an absolute priority. I said I’d be glad to accept their kindness and Martha, mixing gratification with sudden alarm, said she hoped the inheritance wouldn’t persuade me to stop riding races.
“No,” I said.
“That’s positive enough.” Harley was pleased. “You’re part of the package, fella. You and Datepalm together.”
 Brad and I went on to London, and I was very glad to have him drive.
“Office?” he asked, and I said, “Yes,” and we traveled there in silent harmony.
He’d told me the evening before that Greville’s car wasn’t parked anywhere near Greville’s house: or rather he’d handed me back the piece of paper with the car’s number on it and said, “Couldn’t find it.” I thought I’d better get on to the police and other towers-away in Ipswich, and I’d better start learning the company’s finances and Greville’s as well, and I had two-thirds of the vault still to check and I could feel the suction of the quicksand inexorably.
I took the two baffling little gadgets from Greville’s sitting room upstairs to Greville’s office and showed them to June.
“That one,” she said immediately, pointing to the thumb-sized tube with the whine, “is a device to discourage mosquitoes. Mr. Franklin said it’s the noise of a male mosquito, and it frightens the blood-sucking females away.” She laughed. “He said every man should have one.”
She picked up the other gadget and frowned at it, pressing the red button with no results.
“It has an aerial,” I said.
“Oh yes.” She pulled it out to its full extent. “I think ...” She paused. “He used to have a transmitter which started his car from a distance, so he could warm the engine up in cold weather before he left his house, but the receiver bit got stolen with his Porsche. Then he bought the old Rover, and he said a car-starter wouldn’t work on it because it only worked with direct transmission or fuel injection, or something, which the Rover doesn’t have.”
“So this is the car-starter?”
“Well ... no. This one doesn’t do so much. The car-starter had buttons that would also switch on the headlights so that you could see where your car was, if you’d left it in a dark car-park.” She pushed the aerial down again. “I think this one only switches the lights on, or makes the car whistle, if I remember right. He was  awfully pleased with it when he got it, but I haven’t seen it for ages. He had so many gadgets, he couldn’t take them all in his pockets and I think he’d got a bit tired of carrying them about. He used to leave them in this desk, mostly.”
“You just earned your twenty percent all over again,” I said.
“What?”
“Let’s just check that the batteries work,” I said.
She opened the battery compartment and discovered it was empty. As if it were routine, she then pulled open a drawer in one of the other tiers of the desk and revealed a large open box containing packet after packet of new batteries in every possible size. She pulled out a packet, opened it and fed the necessary power packs into the slots, and although pressing the red button still provided no visible results, I was pretty confident we were in business.
June said suddenly, “You’re going to take this to Ipswich, aren’t you? To find his car? Isn’t that what you mean?”
I nodded. “Let’s hope it works.”
“Oh, it must.”
“It’s quite a big town, and the car could be anywhere.”
“Yes,” she said, “but it must be somewhere. I’m sure you’ll find it.”
“Mm.” I looked at her bright, intelligent face. “June,” I said slowly, “don’t tell anyone else about this gadget.”
“Whyever not?”
“Because,” I said, “someone broke into this office looking for something and we don’t know if they found it. If they didn’t, and it is by any chance in the car, I don’t want anyone to realize that the car is still lost.” I paused. “I’d much rather you said nothing.”
“Not even to Annette?”
“Not to anyone.”
“But that means you think ... you think ...”
“I don’t really think anything. It’s just for security.”
Security was all right with her. She looked less troubled and agreed to keep quiet about the car-finder; and I  hadn’t needed to tell her about the mugger who had knocked me down to steal Greville’s bag of clothes, which to me, in hindsight, was looking less and less a random hit and more and more a shot at a target.
Someone must have known Greville was dying, I thought. Someone who had organized or executed a mugging. I hadn’t the faintest idea who could have done either, but it did seem to me possible that one of Greville’s staff might have unwittingly chattered within earshot of receptive ears. Yet what could they have said? Greville hadn’t told any of them he was buying diamonds. And why hadn’t he? Secretive as he was, gems were his business.
The useless thoughts squirreled around and got me nowhere. The gloomiest of them was that someone could have gone looking for Greville’s car at any time since the scaffolding fell, and although I might find the engine and the wheels, the essential cupboard would be bare.
Annette came into the office carrying a fistful of papers which she said had come in the morning mail and needed to be dealt with—by me, her manner inferred.
“Sit down, then,” I said, “and tell me what they all mean.”
There were letters from insurance people, fund-raisers, dissatisfied customers, gemology forecasters, and a cable from a supplier in Hong Kong saying he didn’t have enough African 12mm amethyst AA quality round beads to fill our order and would we take Brazilian amethyst to make it up.
“What’s the difference?” I asked. “Does it matter?”
Annette developed worry lines over my ignorance. “The best amethyst is found in Africa,” she said. “Then it goes to Hong Kong or Taiwan for cutting and polishing into beads, then comes here. The amethyst from Brazil isn’t such a good deep color. Do you want me to order the Brazilian amethyst or wait until he has more of the African?”
“What do you think?” I said.
“Mr. Franklin always decided.”
She looked at me anxiously. It’s hopeless, I thought. The simplest decision was impossible without knowledge.
“Would the customers take the Brazilian instead?” I asked.
“Some would, some wouldn’t. It’s much cheaper. We sell a lot of the Brazilian anyway, in all sizes.”
“Well,” I said, “if we run out of the African beads, offer the customers Brazilian. Or offer a different size of African. Cable the Chinese supplier to send just the Af rican AA 12mm he’s got now and the rest as soon as he can.”
She looked relieved. “That’s what I’d have said.”
Then why didn’t you, I thought, but it was no use being angry. If she gave me bad advice I’d probably blame her for it: it was safer from her viewpoint, I supposed, not to stick her neck out.
“Incidentally,” she said, “I did reach Prospero Jenks. He said he’d be in his Knightsbridge shop at two-thirty today, if you wanted to see him.”
“Great.”
She smiled. “I didn’t mention horses.”
I smiled back. “Fine.”
She took the letters off to her own office to answer them, and I went from department to department on a round trip to the vault, watching everyone at work, all of them capable, willing and beginning to settle obligingly into the change of regime, keeping their inner reservations to themselves. I asked if one of them would go down and tell Brad I’d need him at two, not before. June went and returned like a boomerang.
I unlocked the vault and started on topaz: thousands of brilliant translucent slippery stones in a rainbow of colors, some bigger than acorns, some like peas.
No diamonds.
After that, every imaginable shape and size of garnet, which could be yellow and green, I found, as well as red, and boxes of citrine.
Two and a half hours of unfolding and folding glossy white packets, and no diamonds.
June swirled in and out at one point with a long order for faceted stones which she handed to me without comment, and I remembered that only Greville and Annette packed orders from the vault. I went in search of Annette and asked if I might watch while she worked down the list, found what was needed from twenty or more boxes and assembled the total on the shelf. She was quick and sure, knowing exactly where to find everything. It was quite easy, she said, reassuring me. I would soon get the hang of it. God help me, I thought.
At two, after another of June’s sandwich lunches, I went down to the car and gave Prospero Jenks’s address to Brad. “It’s a shop somewhere near Harrods,” I said, climbing in.
He nodded, drove through traffic, found the shop.
“Great,” I said. “Now this time you’ll have to answer the car phone whether you like it or not, because there’s nowhere here to park.”
He shook his head. He’d resisted the suggestion several times before.
“Yes,” I said. “It’s very easy. I’ll switch it on for you now. When it rings pick it up and press this button, SND, and you’ll be able to hear me. OK? I’ll ring when I’m ready to leave, then you just come back here and pick me up.”
He looked at the telephone as if it were contaminated.
It was a totally portable phone, not a fixture in the car, and it didn’t receive calls unless one switched it on, which I quite often forgot to do and sometimes didn’t do on purpose. I put the phone ready on the passenger seat beside him, to make it easy, and hoped for the best.
Prospero Jenks’s shopwindow glittered with the sort of intense lighting that makes jewelry sparkle, but the lettering of his name over the window was neat and plain, as if ostentation there would have been superfluous.
I looked at the window with a curiosity I would never have felt a week earlier and found it filled not with conventional displays of rings and wristwatches but with joyous toys: model cars, airplanes, skiing figures, racing  yachts, pheasants and horses, all gold and enamel and shining with gems. Almost every passerby, I noticed, paused to look.
Pushing awkwardly through the heavy glass front door, I stepped into a deep carpeted area with chairs at the ready before every counter. Apart from the plushness, it was basically an ordinary shop, not very big, quiet in decor, all the excitement in the baubles.
There was no one but me in there and I swung over to one of the counters to see what was on display. Rings, I found, but not simple little circles. There were huge, often asymmetric, all colorful eye-catchers supreme.
“Can I help you?” a voice said.
A neutral man, middle-aged, in a black suit, coming from a doorway at the rear.
“My name’s Franklin,” I said. “Came to see Prospero Jenks.”
“A minute.”
He retreated, returned with a half smile and invited me through the doorway to the privacies beyond. Shielded from customers’ view by a screening partition lay a much longer space which doubled as office and workroom and contained a fearsome-looking safe and several tiers of little drawers like the ones in Saxony Franklin. On one wall a large framed sign read NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO CUSTOMERS. ALWAYS WATCH THEIR HANDS. A fine statement of no trust, I thought in amusement.
Sitting on a stool by a workbench, a jeweler’s lens screwed into one eye, was a hunched man in pale pink and white striped shirtsleeves fiddling intently with a small gold object fixed into a vise. Patience and expert workmanship were much on view, all of it calm and painstaking.
He removed the lens with a sigh and rose to his feet, turning to inspect me from crown to crutches to toecaps with growing surprise. Whatever he’d been expecting, I was not it.
The feeling, I supposed, was mutual. He was maybe fifty but looked younger in a Peter Pan sort of way; a  boyish face with intense bright blue eyes and a lot of lines developing across the forehead. Fairish hair, no beard, no mustache, no personal display. I had expected someone fancier, more extravagant, temperamental.
“Grev’s brother?” he said. “What a turn-up. There I was, thinking you’d be his age, his height.” He narrowed his eyes. “He never said he had a brother. How do I know you’re legit?”
“His assistant, Annette Adams, made the appointment.”
“Yes, so she did. Fair enough. Told me Grev was dead, long live the King. Said his brother was running the shop, life would go on. But I’ll tell you, unless you know as much as Grev, I’m in trouble.”
“I came to talk to you about that.”
“It don’t look like tidings of great joy,” he said, watching me judiciously. “Want a seat?” He pointed at an office chair for me and took his place on the stool. His voice was a long way from cut-glass. More like East-end London tidied up for West; the sort that came from nowhere with no privileges and made it to the top from sheer undeniable talent. He had the confident manner of long success, a creative spirit who was also a tradesman, an original artist without airs.
“I’m just learning the business,” I said cautiously. “I’ll do what I can.”
“Grev was a genius,” he said explosively. “No one like him with stones. He’d bring me oddities, one-of-a-kinds from all over the world, and I’ve made pieces ...” He stopped and spread his arms out. “They’re in palaces,” he said, “and museums and mansions in Palm Beach. Well, I’m in business. I sell them to wherever the money’s coming from. I’ve got my pride, but it’s in the pieces. They’re good, I’m expensive, it works a treat.”
“Do you make everything you sell?” I asked.
He laughed. “No, not myself personally, I couldn’t. I design everything, don’t get me wrong, but. I have a workshop making them. I just make the special pieces myself, the unique ones. In between, I invent for the general market.  Grev said he had some decent spinel, have you still got it?”
“Er,” I said, “red?”
“Red,” he affirmed. “Three, four or five carats. I’ll take all you’ve got.”
“We’ll send it tomorrow.”
“By messenger,” he said. “Not post.”
“All right.”
“And a slab of rock crystal like the Eiger. Grev showed me a photo. I’ve got a commission for a fantasy. Send the crystal too.”
“All right,” I said again, and hid my doubts. I hadn’t seen any slab of rock crystal. Annette would know, I thought.
He said casually, “What about the diamonds?”
I let the breath out and into my lungs with conscious control.
“What about them?” I said.
“Grev was getting me some. He’d got them, in fact. He told me. He’d sent a batch off to be cut. Are they back yet?”
“Not yet,” I said, hoping I wasn’t croaking. “Are those the diamonds he bought a couple of months ago from the Central Selling Organisation that you’re talking about?”
“Sure. He bought a share in a sight from a sightholder. I asked him to. I’m still running the big chunky rings and necklaces I made my name in, but I’m setting some of them now with bigger diamonds, making more profit per item since the market will stand it, and I wanted Grev to get them because I trust him. Trust is like gold dust in this business, even though diamonds weren’t his thing, really. You wouldn’t want to buy two-to-three-carat stones from just anyone, even if they’re not D or E flawless, right?”
“Er, right.”
“So he bought the share of the sight and he’s having them cut in Antwerp as I need them, as I expect you know.”
I nodded. I did know, but only since he’d just told me. 
“I’m going to make stars of some of them to shine from the rock crystal ...” He broke off, gave a self deprecating shrug of the shoulders, and said, “And I’m making a mobile, with diamonds on gold trembler wires that move in the lightest air. It’s to hang by a window and flash fire in the sunlight.” Again the self-deprecation, this time in a smile. “Diamonds are ravishing in sunlight, they’re at their best in it, and all the social snobs in this city scream that it’s so frightfully vulgar, darling, to wear diamond earrings or bracelets in the daytime. It makes me sick, to be honest. Such a waste.”
I had never thought about diamonds in sunlight before, though I supposed I would in future. Vistas opened could never be closed, as maybe Greville would have said.
“I haven’t caught up with everything yet,” I said, which was the understatement of the century. “Have any of the diamonds been delivered to you so far?”
He shook his head. “I haven’t been in a hurry for them before.”
“And ... er ... how many are involved?”
“About a hundred. Like I said, not the very best color in the accepted way of things but they can look warmer with gold sometimes if they’re not ultra blue-white. I work with gold mostly. I like the feel.”
“How much,” I said slowly, doing sums, “will your rock crystal fantasy sell for?”
“Trade secret. But then, I guess you’re trade. It’s commissioned, I’ve got a contract for a quarter of a million if they like it. If they don’t like it, I get it back, sell it somewhere else, dismantle it, whatever. In the worst event I’d lose nothing but my time in making it, but don’t you worry, they’ll like it.”
His certainty was absolute, built in experience.
I said, “Do you happen to know the name of the Antwerp cutter Grev sent the diamonds to? I mean, it’s bound to be on file in the office, but if I know who to look for ...” I paused. “I could try to hurry him up for you, if you like.”
“I’d like you to, but I don’t know who Grev knew there, exactly.”
I shrugged. “I’ll look it up, then.”
Exactly where was I going to look it up? I wondered. Not in the missing address book, for sure.
“Do you know the name of the sightholder?” I asked.
“Nope.”
“There’s a ton of paper in the office,” I said in explanation. “I’m going through it as fast as I can.”
“Grev never said a word he didn’t have to,” Jenks said unexpectedly. “I’d talk, he listened. We got on fine. He understood what I do better than anybody.”
The sadness of his voice was my brother’s universal accolade, I thought. He’d been liked. He’d been trusted. He would be missed.
I stood up and said, “Thank you, Mr. Jenks.”
“Call me Pross,” he said easily. “Everyone does.”
“My name’s Derek.”
“Right,” he said, smiling. “Now I’ll keep on dealing with you, I won’t say I won’t, but I’m going to have to find me another traveler like Grev, with an eye like his. He’s been supplying me ever since I started on my own, he gave me credit when the banks wouldn’t, he had faith in what I could do. Near the beginning he brought me two rare sticks of watermelon tourmaline that were each over two inches long and were half pink, half green mixed all the way up and transparent with the light shining through them and changing while you watched. It would have been a sin to cut them for jewelry. I mounted them in gold and platinum to hang and twist in sunlight.” He smiled his deprecating smile. “I like gemstones to have life. I didn’t have to pay Grev for that tourmaline ever. It made my name for me, the piece was reviewed in the papers and won prizes, and he said the trade we’d do together would be his reward.” He clicked his mouth. “I do go on a bit.”
“I like to hear it,” I said. I looked down the room to his workbench and said, “Where did you learn all this? How does one start?”
“I started in metalwork classes at the local high school,” he said frankly. “Then I stuck bits of glass in gold-plated wire to give to my mum. Then her friends wanted some. So when I left school I took some of those things to show to a jewelry manufacturer and asked for a job. Costume jewelry, they made. I was soon designing for them, and I never looked back.”
