Chapter 42
CHAPTER FORTY-TWO
Bonner turned fast, almost as though she’d been expecting him. In the same motion, she stretched out her arms to hold Joshua over the pot of boiling water. “If you shoot me, he will drop.” Her voice was sharp, yet also somehow a whisper, like the scrape of a tree branch against a window in the dead of night.
Bonner angled her body so she was partially blocked by Joshua’s torso as his feet dangled just above the top of the pot, a six-inch drop into the water. He wore a little Santa onesie, complete with red and white booties. He kicked his legs and let out a terrifying shriek.
“You do not have to do this,” Austin said. “There are ways out of this, I promise you. How about you put Joshua in the other room, I put down the gun, and we talk this out?”
“You took my sister.”
“I did my job.” Austin had a shot. From this distance, he’d kill Bonner a hundred times out of a hundred. But there was no way he could take it. Joshua would either fall in the boiling water or onto the floor, which could break his neck. “Please, Mary. Set Joshua on the floor. I promise I will not shoot.” The baby's cries were growing louder, more panicked, bouncing around the small kitchen, off the windows and the linoleum floor. He didn’t think the steam was enough to burn him given the booties he wore, but the cries sounded like he was experiencing great pain nonetheless.
Her look was one of puzzlement, as though she was weighing her options. “Put down your gun first.”
When he didn’t move, she began to sing, her words strange and ominous against Joshua’s shrieks.
Christmas is
A time for joy
Let’s gather together
Every girl and boy
On the word “boy” she gave Joshua a little jiggle. “Stop being so fussy.”
“Okay,” Austin said. He crouched slowly, extending the gun in front of him. “I will put it down. Please do not hurt the boy. He has parents. They love him like you love your sister.”
“Love of parents is nothing compared to what Lorraine and I had. She would do anything for me. Anything.”
The way she said the last word unnerved him, as though it carried layers and layers of meaning he couldn’t grasp. What else had they done? How many more had they killed, he wondered?
He set down the gun.
“Kick it over here,” she hissed.
He gave it a gentle tap with his foot and it slid across the kitchen. “Now put Joshua down and we can talk about this.”
Slowly, she moved the baby away from the pot. His cries had reached a hysterical pitch. His breaths fast and ragged like he was hyperventilating.
“What did you do to him?” Austin demanded.
“You’ve never had children. Sometimes they are fussy no matter how much you love them.”
Bonner leaned over slowly, not taking her eyes off Austin, and placed Joshua next to the gun, holding him up by his shoulders. Austin recoiled. Joshua wasn’t strong enough to pick up a gun, let alone to pull a trigger, but still, the sight of a baby next to a loaded gun made him sick.
She’d set him down on his butt, but he was too top-heavy, too young to sit up on his own. When she stood, he began to slump to the left. Austin lunged forward instinctively, trying to protect his head from the fall. He made it, grabbing Joshua’s shoulder just before his head hit the floor.
He saw her move out of the corner of his eye. She let out a horrific shriek as she brought the knife down into his arm.
Austin rocked back, letting go of the baby and falling backwards, striking his head on the kitchen table.
Then everything went black for a few seconds and all he heard were the hinges of his screen door screaming into the night.
