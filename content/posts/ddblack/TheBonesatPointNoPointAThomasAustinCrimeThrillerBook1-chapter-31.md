Chapter 30
CHAPTER THIRTY
Jimmy was on his sixth house when he saw something strange. The rain was coming down in buckets now, filtering through the heavy tree cover and pounding the roof of his car with irregular splashes. A white SUV was parked halfway up a long driveway, maybe thirty yards from the house he was there to check out, the second to last on his list.
He pulled up beside it and rolled down the window. Empty. Why would someone park halfway up a driveway in this kind of weather? He checked the tires; they didn’t appear to be stuck in the mud.
Continuing up the driveway, he parked beside a small raised-bed garden that looked like it hadn’t been tended in a decade. The place was somewhere between a small house and a large cabin—a single-story of maybe eight-hundred square feet. It faced east and was only about twenty yards from a bank that dropped down to the beach fifty feet below. There was no other car at the house, though the attached one-car garage probably explained that.
When he stepped out of the car, his boots dropped into an inch of mud. “Damnit.” He dragged them across a little patch of grass as he made his way to the porch, which was covered by a sagging vinyl awning. The place looked deserted. The curtains were drawn and no light shone through the little window at the top of the front door.
He knocked loudly.
Many of the houses back in these woods were only seasonally occupied, either by Seattle families looking for a summer getaway, or older snowbirds who lived in Arizona or California for the winter and came back for the gorgeous Pacific Northwest summers. In fact, half of the houses he’d checked already had been left vacant for the winter. The others had provided little help. One woman thought she might have seen Trisha’s truck on the morning she left the bones on the beach, but not a single person knew Mary Bonner or recognized her photo.
Jimmy stood on his tiptoes and peered through the frosted window. No movement.
He listened carefully. Not a peep from inside the house. Just the whooshing of the trees above him.
He knocked again. Still nothing.
According to the records, the cabin was owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Houghton. Sounded old, Jimmy thought. No doubt they were golfing in Phoenix right now, or sipping Mai Tai’s in Kona. He and Lucy had talked once about getting a little condo in Kona. Later—the third or fourth time she’d broken up with him—she’d dismissed that as pillow talk. But after last night… He let his mind wander to the warm beach, sitting with Lucy in the sand, matching flip flops and margaritas. She’d have her curly red hair tied up into a bun. He’d swim every day. Hell, maybe they'd even learn to surf.
He shook his head. She’d probably break up with him again tomorrow. And he needed to keep his mind on the job.
He stepped away from the door, planning to head around back. He noticed something on the ground. It was just under the old vinyl awning that extended a few feet from the house. Mostly dry, its cover splattered with a little muddy rain, it was a notebook.
He crouched, opened it.
He read the words written in neat cursive on the inside flap of the cover:
Anna Downey, reporter. Reward if found and returned.
