Chapter 18
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Austin clapped his hands together to get everyone’s attention. “Rule of thirds!” He’d taken the position at the front of the room, standing before the big whiteboard and passing a marker from hand to hand.
Lucy, Jimmy, Ridley, and Samantha sat around the conference table, all consuming their preferred varieties of caffeinated beverage.
“Basic stats in stranger abductions,” Austin continued. “A third of the kids are never found, a third are found dead, a third are found alive. Of the ones who are found alive, the vast majority are found in the first seventy-two hours.” He glanced at his watch. “It’s six o’clock, December 22nd. Joshua Green was abducted roughly fourteen hours ago. If his abductor follows the same timeline as he or she did with Allie Shreever, we have roughly forty-eight hours. If the abductor follows the pattern of most stranger abductions, we have forty-eight hours. And, judging by what the Sheriff of Nottingham just spewed at us, we have forty-eight hours—possibly less—before he allows the FBI to take the lead on this thing. No shame in getting help from the Feds, but Daniels said one thing I agreed with. This is the one. It could be the biggest case you ever work. Do not take that for granted.” He looked from Lucy to Jimmy, from Ridley to Samantha. “I firmly believe that the five of us have the best shot at bringing Joshua home. If the FBI comes in two days from now, chances are…” he lowered his voice… “chances are Joshua Green is already dead.”
“Agreed,” Ridley said.
“Then let’s go get it,” Jimmy added. “Where are we on the phone warrant?”
“Judge has been in court all day,” Ridley said. “Should have it by late tonight. I don’t know about you four, but I’m not going home.”
Jimmy held up a plastic grocery bag, which rattled when he shook it. “Red Bull. Cold Brew. Monster Energy. Even the gum is caffeinated. Enough for everyone.”
“I’ll stick with coffee,” Austin said. “The important thing is that we locate Trisha. I’m convinced she’ll take us to Joshua, or to the person who has him.”
Ridley stood and wrote two names on the whiteboard. Myrian Brightstone and Mary Bonner. “These are the two nurses who didn’t show up for their shifts. I’m on a Board of Directors with the administrator of the hospital. Spoke with him personally. Neither of these nurses has a single mark on their records. He said that Brightstone is a known partier, but she doesn’t let it affect her work. Both called in sick. They are not ‘disappearances’ as some reporters would like the public to believe.”
Jimmy cracked a Red Bull. “Still. It’s interesting, no?” He took a long swig, smacking his lips in Lucy’s direction.
“How can you drink that stuff?” Lucy asked.
He held up the can. “Sugar free.”
Ignoring them, Ridley said, “I’ve got officers heading over to their apartments now to question them.”
Samantha had been typing on her laptop as though she wasn’t listening, but stopped suddenly. “What do you want to know about them?”
“Whatcha got?” Austin asked.
“Myrian Brightstone is all over Facebook and Instagram. She’s thirty-five, pretty, and flaunts it. Yoga poses, beach selfies, tequila shots with friends. She has a thing about taking pictures of her and her friends doing shots. No kids, is dating a woman named Diane.” She glanced down at her laptop. “And possibly a guy named Samuel as well. Went to Mexico for a friend’s wedding last year. Big partier, it looks like. No red flags when it comes to abductions. I’ll have to get the metadata and geotags, but she was posting stuff late into the night when Joshua was taken.”
“Can’t you set up posts in advance?” Austin asked. “To create an alibi?”
Samantha nodded. “But it’s a lot harder to fake location tags. She was in Tacoma, ninety minutes from Bainbridge, at midnight the night Joshua disappeared. Closed down a bar there with her friends. Still had time to make it to the island, but she also has a location-tagged post the next morning. Doesn’t rule her out, but it’s a stretch.”
“Good work,” Ridley said. “We’ll verify with the bar. And Mary Bonner?”
“Rents an apartment in Bremerton. Been a nurse for a long time. She’s got a 2014 Kia Soul registered in her name. No record. She’s not on social media at all, at least not that I’ve found yet. Very little online imprint.”
“Keep digging,” Ridley said.
Itsy was chasing a fly around in the corner of the room, standing on her hind legs, snapping her jaw, swiping at it with her one good front paw, and missing by a mile.
“Excuse me for a sec,” Austin said, heading out to the hallway and dialing the shop.
The phone rang for a long time before Andy answered. “Tell me it took you so long to pick up because the place is packed tonight.”
Andy chuckled. “Does four customers count as packed?”
Austin smiled. “Not bad for three days before Christmas. Thanks for holding down the fort.”
“Your new burger is literally flying off the menu. Made two already. One guy said you should bottle that tomato jam.”
Austin paced the hallway. “Glad to hear it. Did you let Run out into the yard?”
“Yup,” Andy said. “Fed her, too.”
“Appreciate it. I didn’t figure I’d be gone all day, but I may be gone all night.”
“Anything on the missing kid?” His voice had turned somber. “Everyone who’s been in has been talking about him.”
“We’re doing our best.”
“Were you really a badass NYPD detective before?”
Austin smiled. He’d told Andy he used to work for the NYPD, but shared as little about himself as he could get away with. “I don’t know about the ‘badass’ part, but yeah. Twenty years in the NYPD, ten as a detective.”
“People are talking about it. An old lady came in and said she looked you up. Said you looked like Bobby Simone. She was thirsting big time.”
“I understood only fifty percent of the words you just said.”
“Bobby Simone, from NYPD Blue. Played by Jimmy Smits. Went off the air when I was seven, don’t tell me I know more about it than you.”
He’d heard of it, but TV had never been his thing. “Okay, and what does ‘thirsting’ mean?”
“You don’t want to know, boss. One more thing, though, a lady came in, looking for you, kinda pushy.”
Austin leaned on the wall. “Lemme guess. Above average height, blonde ponytail, holding a notebook?”
“That’s her. Anna something. Don’t worry, I didn’t tell her anything. She ordered the French Dip sliders, extra horseradish. Left a thirty percent tip, so I can’t complain. Not gonna lie, she seemed kinda thirsty, too.”
Austin got it now.
He thanked Andy, promised to check in tomorrow, and headed for the lobby. The coffee was lukewarm, so he gulped it down like water and refilled it. As he opened the door to the conference room, he saw everyone hunched around Samantha, all staring at Trisha’s phone.
“New message,” Ridley said. “Could be big.”
Austin leaned over and read: Juanita’s Mexican Restaurant has confirmed your DoorDash order. We’ll let you know when your Dasher has picked up your food for delivery!
Lucy leapt up. “Juanita’s is in Bremerton. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes from here.”
“No way she’d be stupid enough to order food,” Jimmy said.
Lucy punched his arm. “Twenty bucks says she is exactly that stupid.”
Ridley said, “I’ve got twenty with Lucy. Cop shows make criminals out to be a helluva lot smarter than they usually are.”
Austin was still stuck on the text. “How did she order food when we have her phone?”
“You can have the app on multiple phones,” Samantha said. “And you can order from a computer, assuming you have your login info.”
“How long ’til the food’s delivered?” Ridley asked. “How does it work?”
Samantha shut her laptop and placed the phone on top of it. “Most places, it’s twenty to forty minutes. But it depends on where you get the food delivered.”
“Even if she’s dumb enough to order food,” Austin said, “she’s not getting it delivered to the apartment she’d just fled.
Samantha nodded. “And it’s unlikely DoorDash delivers from Bremerton to Kingston. Too far. You can put in any address you want. A hotel, for example.”
“There’s no way for us to tell where the food is headed?” Austin asked.
Samantha picked up Trisha’s phone. “Not without unlocking this. Three ways to find out. One: ask Trisha. Two: get DoorDash to tell you, and good luck with that. Three: trail the delivery person.”
“What about the restaurant?” Ridley asked.
“They don’t see the address on the ticket. Just the order and a name. Only the Dasher sees the actual address.”
Ridley was already throwing on his jacket. “Samantha, ride with me. I need to understand everything I can about how this works. Lucy and Austin, follow me in Lucy’s car.”
“Jimmy, you stay here. Get DoorDash on the phone and get that address, no matter what it takes.”
