Chapter 20
CHAPTER TWENTY
Lucy screeched to a stop in the parking lot of Juanita’s, a hole-in-the-wall joint with a tiny sign that couldn’t be seen from the road. In Austin’s experience, this was the type of place most likely to serve authentic food. As he got out of the car, the savory aromas hit him right away and reminded him that he’d been surviving on black coffee all day.
Samantha and Ridley had yet to arrive, but Lucy charged through the parking lot, Austin right on her heels as she burst through the door of the packed restaurant. It smelled of cumin and grilled meat, of corn tamales and rich mole sauces.
Lucy yanked out her badge and held it in front of the hostess’s face. “Detective Lucy O’Rourke, Kitsap County Sheriff’s Department. I need to speak with a manager.”
The young lady took a step back, thought for a moment, then hurried into the kitchen without saying a word. Lucy was generally mild-mannered, but could be pretty damn commanding when she wanted to be.
A moment later, a short, squat woman emerged, wearing a white apron, her hair tied into a messy bun. She wiped her hands on a rag, then hung it over her shoulder with an efficient flick of the wrist. “I am Juanita.” She looked to be in her late fifties and had a thick accent, her words a little forced and searching, as though English was her second language.
Lucy said, “You received an order from DoorDash about thirty minutes ago. We need to know where it went.”
The woman blinked, confused. “Ten or twenty orders we received tonight already.”
“Can you show me?”
The woman eyed her skeptically. “Orders no have addresses. Only delivery person sees.”
Austin cursed under his breath. He’d hoped Samantha was wrong about that, but he wasn’t surprised to learn that she was right. Like most people under thirty, she seemed to live in a different world, one with rules and systems he didn’t understand.
“Show us, please,” Lucy said. “This is a critical police matter involving a missing baby.”
Juanita squinted at Lucy. “El bebé de la isla Bainbridge?” In Spanish, her words came lightning fast. Her look shifted to genuine concern, as though the idea that her restaurant could have anything to do with the kidnapping horrified her.
“Sí,” Austin said. “The baby from Bainbridge Island.” He’d picked up a little Spanish on the job in New York. “We know you have nothing to do with it. It is a customer we are looking for.” He gestured at a tablet terminal next to a cash register, where he assumed orders came in. “Por favor.”
She hurried over to the counter, studying the screen for an aggravatingly long time between single-fingered taps. Austin had worked in restaurants to put himself through college. In that business, there were front-of-the-house people and back-of-the-house people. Like Austin himself, Juanita was definitely more comfortable in the back of the house. Finally, she gave up and waved over the hostess, spoke rapid Spanish—incomprehensible to Austin—and moved aside.
Seconds later, the young woman said, “Okay,” and returned to the dining room.
The screen displayed a list of orders from the last hour. Sure enough, right in the middle, was an order from “Trisha S.,” placed at 6:05 PM. A chicken burrito, rice and beans, and a Mexican soda called Jarritos, mandarin orange flavored. There was no address listed and only half a phone number, the second half blacked out.
Austin pointed at the order. “Can you click it to get more information or something?”
Lucy shook her head.
Juanita said, “No.”
Austin pointed at the screen. “It says that Dasher’s name is Mark. Who is Mark?”
“Delivery man.”
It said the order had been picked up at 6:31. It was now 6:38. Austin cursed under his breath. Seven minutes. They’d missed him by seven minutes.
“Can you call?” He tapped on the phone number listed for Trisha S., the second half of which was blacked out.
Lucy said, “They make it so you can call without seeing the whole number. Privacy.”
“Sí,” Juanita said. “Only through the tablet.” She tapped twice, picked up the tablet and handed it to Austin. He felt ridiculous holding the thing up to his head like a phone, but after three rings, a woman’s voice said, “Hello?”
It was a voice he recognized. “Samantha?”
“Austin? Why are you calling me on Trisha’s phone?”
“Damn.” He’d hoped Trisha had added a different number to the account.
“We’re only a few minutes out,” Samantha said. “And Trisha got another text—‘Dasher is on the way’—something to that effect. And Ridley got the call. Search warrants have been approved for the laptop we found in Trisha’s apartment.”
“Good,” Austin said. He ended the call and scanned the tablet again, scrolling down in hopes of finding anything else that might help them.
Lucy pointed to the “Notes” section and read it aloud. “Knock twice. Leave bag outside. Any problems, have dasher text 360-555-1290.”
Jackpot. Austin grabbed the land line and dialed. A man’s voice came on the line. “Hello?”
The voice was loud, somehow the thing was on speaker phone, and Austin stepped back into a supply closet off the lobby, carrying the phone and tablet with him. Lucy and Juanita followed him.
Thinking fast, he said, “This is Brian from Juanita’s. May I speak to Trisha? It’s regarding her order.”
“She’s not in.”
He glanced at Lucy, who shrugged. “Um, have you received an order yet?”
“No. App says it’s three minutes away.”
“We’re concerned the dasher may have picked up the wrong order, can you confirm the name and address on the order so we can check it against our order history?”
The man didn’t reply.
Austin held his breath. All he heard was breathing, and possibly a cat’s faint meow in the background.
Finally, the man said, “I’m sorry, who is this again?”
“Brian. From Juanita’s.”
“No suenas como un Mexicano.”
Austin wasn’t certain, but he thought that meant something like, “You don’t sound Mexican.”
“I’m new,” he said.
“I eat there three times a week, bro, every single person there is Mexican, Juanita’s sisters and cousins and nieces. Who is this?”
Austin thought fast. He considered telling him the truth and demanding the return of Joshua, but that would likely cause the man to flee if in fact he had anything to do with the kidnapping. “I’ll get the manager.” He handed the phone to Juanita, who looked like she had little idea what was going on. Austin whispered, “Tell him there’s a problem with the order.”
“This is Juanita,” she said. “You ordered chicken burrito, soda?”
“Yes.”
“We were out of shredded chicken. Substitute grilled.”
She was a better liar than he expected.
“That’s fine,” the man said.
“If it’s a problem I will send you five dollar coupon. Cinco dólares. Just tell me home address and I send.”
She was a much better liar than he expected.
The man said, “Really, it’s fine. You guys are the bomb, and the order is here now anyway. Bye.”
The line went dead.
Ridley and Samantha burst through the door. Ridley looked pissed.
“Wrong turn,” Samantha said, apologetically and to no one in particular.
“We got this,” Lucy said. Then, turning back to Juanita, “Mark, the dasher guy, do you have a number for him?”
Juanita smiled proudly, hands on her hips. “He’s my grandson.”
Austin let out an exasperated sigh, his eyes nearly bulging out of his head. She couldn’t have mentioned that earlier? “Cell phone number. Quickly. Please.”
“He can’t tell you the address. Against the rules. Get our account canceled with DoorDash.”
Lucy put her hands on her hips, about to go at her. Austin pulled out his phone, found the photo of the bag of bones Ridley had sent him, and held it up to her. “In this bag are the bones of a tiny baby. Another baby is missing. El bebé de la isla Bainbridge. Call your grandson. Get the address where the burrito was delivered. You can help us save a child.”
Juanita looked at the photo, pulled the rag off of her shoulder, and wiped her hands again, even though they still seemed perfectly clean.
She picked up the landline and dialed.
