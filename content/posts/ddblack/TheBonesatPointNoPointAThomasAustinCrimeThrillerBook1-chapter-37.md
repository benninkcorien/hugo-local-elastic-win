Chapter 36
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
They’d been searching in vain for six hours when Austin returned to the café for a break. “Andy, coffee please.”
Andy handed him a tall paper cup of black coffee. “You look like hell, boss.”
Run bolted out from behind the counter, where Austin had set up her doggie bed that morning. It seemed like days ago.
Austin swigged the coffee, then sat on the floor, exhausted. “Calm down, Run. It’s okay.”
Run leapt into his lap, whined, then barked in his face. She jumped up and ran across the room and pushed the side of her body against the space where the floor met the wall, rubbing her nose and twisting her head as though she were trying to dry herself off. She hopped back from the wall, held still for a moment, then barked loudly before diving into Austin’s lap, where she began whining softly and licking under his chin.
“What has gotten into, you silly pup? I’ve not been around much the past few days, have I? Settle, settle.”
He pet behind Run’s ears and she finally calmed down, curled into a ball and let out a deep sigh, then yawned. It was an odd thing to think about, but Austin realized that the last few days were the most time they’d spent apart since he’d found her at the rescue shelter the week he’d moved to Hansville. It seemed like the day had been as stressful for her as it had been for him.
“Been going door to door,” Austin said, “checking abandoned cabins and beach shacks. Safe to say I’m tired.”
All he wanted to do was head back into his apartment, flop onto the couch with Run, have a beer, and turn on a game. There was no football today, but he didn’t care. He’d take bowling or competitive darts at this point. But there was no time for breaks.
Andy had set up their commercial coffee maker near the entryway, along with hundreds of paper cups. He’d also set out a few dozen pre-made sandwiches, along with muffins and Christmas donuts they’d special ordered to last them through the holidays. The café was being used as a launching point for the search teams, which Andy had helped organize along with local residents who ran the town’s Facebook group.
Jimmy filled the reservoir of the coffee maker from a large pitcher of water. “Anything yet?”
Austin shook his head. “They’ve talked to maybe a quarter of the houses in town. A couple joggers thought they saw a white SUV around the right time, but that’s it. Say it was heading this way from 360th, but that ain’t much. Lead detective wants me to go to the hospital, talk to Jimmy. Leave the hunt to them. With the volunteers, they’ve got a hundred people on it.”
Andy walked around the counter, carrying another tray of sandwiches. “It’s a small town. She’s gotta be somewhere.”
As Andy stacked the sandwiches, Austin grabbed one off the top. “Only way out is by boat or on the one road, which they had blocked within two minutes of Jimmy’s radio call. Assuming Jimmy made that call the moment she left, there’s no way she made it past the blockade. It’s impossible. She’s either in Hansville or she’s on a boat. She’s sixty, having to manipulate a younger, stronger captive, and a baby. I doubt she’s in a boat.” He shook his head. “I think she’s close by. It’s only a matter of time.” He was trying to stay positive, but the fact that she was cornered was not necessarily a plus. Trapping a killer was usually a good thing, but when the killer held two hostages, it got more complicated. A lot could go wrong.
He gave Run one last pet, then shooed her away and headed for his car.

Austin hated hospitals. He’d spent three weeks in one after the shooting that killed Fiona. He received two different surgeries for his wounds and took enough pain meds to leave him numb. More than once, he thought the only way he’d leave the hospital was in a box. Once or twice, he’d wished it had been him who’d taken the fatal bullet instead of Fiona.
When he’d finally been rolled out into a cold fall day, he’d been awed by the simple beauty of New York City in the fall and he’d vowed not to enter another hospital until he was at death’s door. And maybe not even then.
The smell was what got to him. Antiseptic, and somehow smelling of disease and death at the same time.
The presence of Sheriff Daniels standing outside Jimmy’s door didn’t make it any better. “Well,” he said, arms crossed, blocking the door to Jimmy’s room, “if it isn’t our New York cowboy.”
“How’s Jimmy?”
“Alive. Barely.” He let out a long breath. “He’s going to live.”
“Can I see him?”
Daniels scoffed. His cheeks were pale, not their usual red. It seemed even he laid off the bottle when one of his officers was wounded.
“You may not like me,” Austin said. “But… look… Ridley sent me. He mentioned some evidence that may have been at the scene. And we couldn’t find it. It could be important to locating Mary Bonner. I really need to talk to him.”
“He can’t talk. He was in surgery for five hours as they tried to put his intestines back together with duct tape, you arrogant asshole.”
“I’m sorry.”
“You should be. Whole time you’ve been telling us ‘copycat, copycat.’ Turns out Mary Bonner is directly connected to your Holiday Baby Butcher, and has been the whole damn time.” The words were accompanied by spittle flying in Austin’s general direction.
As much as Austin wanted to slap the guy, he was more confused than anything. “What do you mean?”
“Our tech intern—what’s her name? Suzanne or something?”
“Samantha.”
“She handed this to me on the way out the door.” Daniels pulled a folded piece of paper from his back pocket and slapped it into Austin’s chest. “You screwed up. This case, the original Lorraine D’Antonia case. Maybe both. And it almost cost Jimmy his life. Best case scenario, he’ll be eating through a straw and shitting into a bag for months.”
Austin took the paper.
Daniels gave him one last look of disdain, then sauntered down the hall. Austin watched him go, then slumped into an uncomfortable chair in the hallway and unfolded the paper. It was an article from the Seattle Times, printed off the internet.
The headline read:
Johnson Hill Orphanage Settles Case of Illegal Placements from 1970s
He scanned the opening paragraph once, then again.
Oh, No.
He’d considered what it meant for Mary Bonner to have had papers from the same orphanage as Lorraine D’Antonia, but figured it was another piece of her obsession.
As he read the article, it turned out it was something else entirely.
Something far, far worse.
