Chapter 5
CHAPTER FIVE
Ridley wheeled in a TV and dimmed the lights in his office. He couldn’t get the interview to stream from his phone onto the TV, so he grabbed a young deputy named Jimmy from the other room. Jimmy was just as muscular as Ridley, though half a head shorter, and he quickly got the TV working.
The video began with a quick zoom from a wide shot of the room to a tighter shot that started at Lorraine D’Antonia’s shackled feet and ended at the top of her head of thin, wispy hair. Her face was sallow, approaching the color of the white prison garb she wore, and she’d aged more than Austin had expected. Her hair had been thick and voluminous when he’d arrested her. Maybe she’d lost it from stress, or maybe it had just fallen into its natural state when deprived of the hair products she was known to love. Her nails were no longer the thick, well-manicured artificial ones she’d worn on the outside. They were neatly manicured to rounded points and painted a light gray, the same color as the prison walls. Nail polish wasn’t allowed in prison, but D’Antonia had found a way. Paint and floor sealer, Austin thought.
In any case, she looked like she’d aged ten years in the three she’d been locked up. He’d hoped never to see her face again. Never to hear her low, monotonous voice, and the strange way she spoke—not like some caricature of evil—though she was as evil as they came—but also not like a regular person. Hers was a pathology he had never experienced before or since.
Austin heard Ridley’s voice off camera. “Please state your name.”
“Lorraine D’Antonia.” Though she’d been adopted by an Italian-American family, she’d lived all over the country—like Austin himself—leaving her with no discernible accent.
“Thank you, Ms. D’Antonia. I am Detective Ridley Calvin of the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Department. I appreciate you meeting with me today. I am here because a kidnapping and murder occurred recently, and I’d like to ask you a few questions.”
“You are so tall!”
Ridley said, “I am.”
“I am only five foot two,” D’Antonia said. Her voice still had a deeply disturbing timbre. Low and steady, like a loud whisper. “I’ve been reading a lot lately. Harry Potter. You are as big as Hagrid.”
From off camera, Ridley said, “I took my kids to the Harry Potter exhibit in Seattle once and they had Hagrid’s chair from the movie set for people to sit in. So, I took pictures of my kids in it and they looked tiny. Then I sat in it and my kids laughed because it looked just the right size.”
D’Antonia’s laugh was even more disturbing than her voice. Dry and forced, like she had a can of laughter stuck in her throat and released bursts from it one by one.
Ridley’s approach to the interview confirmed Austin’s hunch that he was damn good at his job. Austin knew how revolting it was to make small talk with the world’s most vicious killers. He also knew that it was part of the job, a part that could solve crimes and save lives when one was good at it. And Ridley was. He’d read D’Antonia right from the moment he walked in the room. Sometimes it was a good idea to go into an interview with guns blazing, aggressive and confrontational. But not with someone like D’Antonia. She genuinely believed she’d done nothing wrong. She wanted to be heard, needed to be appreciated. In short, she definitely required a “catch more flies with honey” kind of interview.
When her laughter faded, D’Antonia said, “What would you like to ask me, Mr. Calvin?”
“Please, Mr. Calvin is my father. Call me Rid.” He cleared his throat. “Now, I want to say, we know you had nothing to do with what I’m here to talk about, and I’m not here to relitigate the past, what happened in Seattle or New York.”
“I loved those children. And they loved me.”
Austin tensed. He tasted moldy bread again. She’d overdosed those babies with strychnine, then boiled them in massive canning pots. Even Ridley playing the good cop couldn’t muster a conversational response to this.
Ignoring her statement, he asked, “Do you know anyone who might have admired you, might have wanted to celebrate holidays with babies the way you did?”
Austin’s stomach turned and he glanced at Ridley, whose feet were up on his desk. “You’re a more patient man than I,” Austin said.
“Took everything I had to stay level-headed,” Ridley replied.
On the screen, D’Antonia said, “Celebrate, yes. You get it. Those babies loved the holidays just like I do.” She was silent for a long time, staring straight ahead, motionless. Finally, she shifted in her chair slowly. It creaked beneath her. “No. I can’t think of anyone.”
“Did you ever have any help when you took the children? A boyfriend maybe, a girlfriend?”
She shook her head slowly. “I like boys.”
“And what about after you were arrested? Did anyone contact you to find out about the case, anyone who seemed especially interested?”
“My lawyers.”
“Other than them.”
She shook her head again. Then, a flash in her eyes, some sort of recognition. “Is someone out in the world celebrating with new babies the way I did?”
“Yes, that’s what I’m here about.”
“But who?”
“Well…” he cleared his throat, and Austin could hear the frustration in his tone. “Like I said, that’s why I’m here, Ms. D’Antonia. I’ll ask you directly. Can you think of anyone you might have talked to about the specific nature of what you did, the details, someone who might know the things you did, who would want to do them similarly?”
Looking down at her nails, she folded and refolded her hands in her lap, the handcuffs clanging dully. “What was the name of the handsome one?”
“I’m sorry?”
“The one who arrested me in New York?”
Austin heard papers shuffling in the video. Ridley said, “Arresting officer was Thomas Austin.”
“Mmm, yes, Austin. He asked a lot of questions.”
“That was his job, Ms. D’Antonia.”
She shrugged. “He was not as big as you.”
“Few are.”
“You are bigger than most.”
“I am.”
“He was not. But he is more handsome.”
D’Antonia had an odd conversational style. Sometimes she could carry on a seemingly normal conversation, other times she dropped into a strange, literal directness. And at other times she could describe her own acts, the most heinous crimes he’d ever seen, as though reading the assembly instructions for a piece of furniture. It was almost as though she was heavily drugged. Downers, maybe. But they’d found no evidence of drug use anywhere in her past.
D’Antonia said, “My lawyer told me that I will not be able to have a new trial. That the judge was unwilling to throw out my confession. Is that something you can help me with? I do not belong here.”
“I’m not going to lie, I don’t know if I can help you. But I will tell you this: if you can give me information that helps me figure out who is taking children like you used to, I will put in a good word with the judge.”
She considered this. “I don’t know if it can help anymore. My appeal was denied.”
Ridley paused the playback and turned to Austin. “Couple months back, her bastard lawyer was trying for a new trial based on some bullshit. False confession. Judge threw it out, reconfirmed her sentence. She will never see the light of day.”
Austin had been in the room when she confessed to the kidnapping and murder of Sonya Lopez. There was nothing false about it and he was glad a judge had agreed.
When Ridley started the video again, he summarized the meeting while fast-forwarding through a long section. “She talked around stuff for a while, asked me about other books—she loves fantasy, mostly for younger audiences. Kinda sickened me, a lot of the same stuff my kids read. Sometimes she comes off as an adult, sometimes she feels like a little girl still. Sometimes it seems she’s on the spectrum, other times not at all. There’s a part at the end I want to show you.”
When he re-started the video, he was halfway through a question. “…else can you tell me about that?”
“I never told anyone else about the poems. Except for Detective Austin. He told me he didn’t like my poems, but I didn’t believe him. After all, the handsome detective moved across the country, just like me. New York to Washington State, though I think his new home is likely nicer than mine.” She giggled at her joke, a sickening, girlish giggle that clashed with her pale face and wisps of gray hair.
Ridley turned off the video and flicked on the lights. “I spent a lot of time asking her about the poems. She gave me nothing.”
“Why spend so much time on that?”
Ridley slid his phone across the desk. “There’s something I didn’t tell you yet.” The screen showed a photograph, the same one Ridley had sent him earlier in the day, looking into the bag of bones from above. “Swipe right.”
Austin did. In the next photo, a couple dozen bones were spread out on a shiny metal table. The next showed a closeup of a single bone.
Austin tried to swallow the taste of dread, a dry burnt-toast bitterness. He zoomed in on the bone. In tiny scratches, but clear enough to read, he saw two words: “Thanksgiving is.”
A month or so before Fiona had been killed, she and Austin had spent an evening—and a couple bottles of good Burgundy—debating whether truly evil criminals like D’Antonia were born that way, or created by circumstance. The classic nature vs. nurture argument. Austin tended to fall on the side of nurture: upbringing, trauma, abuse, and desperation leading to most crimes. But Fiona had used his own case against him, specifically D’Antonia’s decent upbringing and the poems she’d carved into the tiny bones of her victims. What could happen to a person that would make them do something like this?
He swiped left again, zoomed in on another bone: “A time to praise.”
Swiping and zooming as fast as he could, he read the entire poem, etched into a dozen tiny rib bones. Just as Lorraine D’Antonia had done, the killer had written twelve lines using the baby’s twelve rib bones, the first line written on the top rib and the rest descending from there.
Thanksgiving is
A time to praise
To love each other
And cherish each day
To gather around
A feast fit for a king
To laugh and toast
To love and sing
So come ye all
To our table this fall
And savor each moment
And love one and all
He handed Ridley the phone. Assuming Austin hadn’t missed something, the poems had never hit the press and had been left out of the trial.
Ridley could tell what he was thinking. “Like I said, NYPD Austin, it’s gotta be a copycat, but it may be the best we’ve ever seen.”
