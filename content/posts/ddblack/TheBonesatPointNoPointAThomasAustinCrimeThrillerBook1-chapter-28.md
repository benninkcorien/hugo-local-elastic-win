Chapter 27
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
Austin flicked off his headlights and watched the tiny waves break on the rocky beach, foam gliding up the shore in the moonlight. He’d never been so happy to be home. The final mile of his drive into Hansville made him feel as though he was leaving the world behind and entering an alternate reality where things were smaller, simpler, and better.
Even after the longest day he’d had since moving here, his body relaxed as he came down the long hill into town, where the trees opened onto water, islands, mountains, and sky. Not that Silverdale, Bremerton, and Kingston were big cities—the closest big city was Seattle, a forty-minute ferry ride across the Sound—but compared to Hansville, any city was bustling.
His hand was on the door handle when a light glinted off his rearview mirror. He turned quickly, but could no longer see it. Studying the darkness, he watched for movement. The light flicked on again. A low glow in the shadows of his building, like a dim flashlight or, more likely, a phone screen. He watched closely, allowing his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Then he saw the figure.
He couldn’t make out a face, not even a torso, but the person’s white shoes caught just enough moonlight to be visible. He’d gotten his concealed carry permit when he moved to Washington State, but hadn’t once carried a gun. After living in New York City, Hansville felt like the safest place on earth. But staring into the shadows, he wished his MR1911 was in the car, not locked in a safe at home.
But then again, whoever was standing there had seen him pull in. He was sure of that. So they wouldn’t be looking at their phone if they’d come to do him harm. Not to mention, even if Mary Bonner knew he was working the case, she’d have no reason to come after him.
He was being paranoid. The last couple days had put him back into the mindset of a detective, a mindset in which killers and rapists were his daily companions, and danger lurked in every shadow.
He swung open the door and took three long strides toward the shadowed figure. The last of his fears disappeared as Anna Downey stepped out from the shadows. “Ridley said you were on the way home, and you weren’t answering your cell.”
Austin stopped halfway across the parking lot. “So you thought waiting in the shadows outside my place at one in the morning was a good idea? You’re starting to make the hounds at the Post and the Daily News look like model citizens.”
“I know cops have to hate reporters—it kinda comes with the badge—but you have no trouble using us when it suits your needs.”
Austin couldn’t deny this. He’d leaked stories to reporters often enough, but always with a strategic aim. “I’m not a cop. But when I was, if it would help get a case moving, freak out a suspect, or marshal the public to find a suspect, count me in. Difference is, I do it in service of solving crimes, you do it to sell papers.”
“I’m personally offended!” Anna protested, a little too loudly. “We’re online only. I do it for the clicks.”
Austin said nothing.
“Oh, c’mon. I’m the one who has to rely on clicks to pay my kid’s college tuition.” She stepped toward him. “I can’t even get a pity laugh?”
“I’m too tired to laugh.” He walked past her, heading around the side of the building. “And I know you didn’t come here to tell jokes.”
She followed him. “I have a scoop. It’s big, and you won't like it.”
He stopped and leaned on the gate, which led into a little fenced-in yard. “And I’m guessing Ridley wouldn’t give you a comment?”
“Sure he did.” She looked down at her notebook dramatically, though it was too dark to read. “He said, and I quote, ‘No bleeping comment. And if you print that, you’re blacklisted from my department.’ End quote. And, as you can imagine, he didn’t use the word ‘bleeping.’”
“Sounds serious. Whatever it is, I wouldn’t print it. And you already know I won’t say anything, so why are you here?”
“Because it’s my job.” She stepped closer, a little too close, and he could smell her perfume. The scent was very northwest, like cedar and sea foam. “I’m here because, as much as you might not like it, as much as it might make your job harder, I have every right to do mine. And not only that, I’m damn good at it. Despite what my paychecks would indicate.” Her tone wasn’t angry, but it also told him she’d had this conversation with enough people to hold her own.
Austin was curious about any scoop big enough to have Ridley threaten to blacklist her. He didn’t walk away, but he also didn’t reply.
She took this as an opening. “I’ve noticed something about guys who work in law enforcement.” She stepped back and put her hands on her hips.
“What’s that?”
“You always assume that keeping every scintilla of information to yourselves is the best way to solve crimes.”
Austin shrugged. “I’m really tired. I need to let my dog out. What’s your point?”
She pulled her phone out of the back pocket of her jeans, tapped, and swiped. “It means that the Kitsap Sheriff department has been sitting on this photo for twenty-two days.” A ball of iron lodged in his belly—dread—and the taste of burnt toast coated his tongue.
She held up her phone. The photo was the Thanksgiving bag holding the bones of Allie Shreever, sitting on a driftwood log on the beach.
His mind raced. Who could have leaked it. Lucy? Jimmy? Samantha?
No. There was no way.
Then it hit him. Teenagers take photos of everything. “Was it Sarah or Benny?”
“I’m not at liberty to reveal my sources, but it was Benny.”
“That little shit. How much?”
She scoffed. “I don’t pay for stories. I get them through working my ass off. If you had kids, you’d understand.”
Austin bristled. The mention of kids brought back Fiona and he was way too tired for this.
She must have noticed his irritation. “I’m sorry. That was out of line.” She walked in a little circle, the only sound was the shuffling of her feet over the gravel driveway and the faint crashing of small waves. “Look, the Sheriff’s department hid from the public for three weeks that the murder of Allie Shreever—the way her body was discovered—was damn near identical to the murders of a half dozen other babies. Hid the fact her killer has the exact same MO as one of the most notorious serial killers in American history. I know you’ve only been on this for two days. It wasn’t your call. Personally, I believe that decision made Kitsap County less safe.”
“How so?”
“Maybe if the Green family knew that The Holiday Baby Butcher had a clone out there, they would have put the crib in their room that night. Maybe if…” she trailed off, kicked some gravel toward the beach, then turned back to Austin. “Look, there are a million woulda-coulda-shouldas here.”
Austin’s mind was racing. What would happen if the photo came out? The case of Lorraine D’Antonia had been one of the most talked-about of the last decade. Female serial killers were rare, ones who committed their atrocities in major media markets like Seattle and New York, even rarer. The fact that she’d targeted newborns—the most innocent among us—made the case even more disturbing, if that was possible. The last thing Austin had ever wanted was celebrity, but when he’d helped catch D’Antonia, he’d been drawn into a media circus that had taken months to die down, and only then because he’d done everything he could to kill it.
He’d been profiled against his will in a few magazines, and, at Fiona’s urging, agreed to a couple segments on CNN, which had followed the story for months. In Fiona’s view, he was a young, handsome detective, someone who made people feel good about law enforcement when most of the press they received was negative. She’d said, “It makes people feel safer to know guys like you are out there.” He wasn’t sure about that, but he’d figured out pretty quickly that TV was not his thing. He didn’t like how little nuance the format allowed for, and he really didn’t like putting on makeup.
If Anna’s photo came out, the circus around the Holiday Baby Butcher would come back to town. The FBI would lead the charge into Kitsap County. They’d have no choice but to take on a larger role, and Sheriff Daniels would probably welcome them with open arms. It would get Daniels on TV and put his detectives in their place.
Next, the entire national media would descend. True crime experts, authors, amateur web sleuths. Every TV crime show would run a variation on the headline: The Ultimate Copycat? Holiday Baby Butcher Back on the Scene, Despite Being Behind Bars. Or, even worse: Holiday Baby Butcher Returns! Was Lorraine D’Antonia Falsely Convicted?
Speculation would be all over the place. Had Austin blown the original case? Had D’Antonia falsely confessed? Had the real killer been free all this time? Hell, with the way nonsense spread on the internet, Austin might wake up to a blog post accusing him of the murders. After all, he’d recently moved to Hansville, where the bones were found. The internet had no limits when it came to stupidity.
He ran a hand through his hair. “We made a breakthrough today. We’re close. Is there anything I can do to convince you not to run that photo?”
“I’m sorry. My editor already has the piece. The photo. Look at it from our point of view. It would be malpractice not to run it.”
“Then I don’t think we have anything more to say to one another.” When he opened the gate, he heard Run’s eager paws scrambling across the kitchen. She knew the sound of that gate and responded to it as though a juicy ribeye steak was making its way into the yard. She burst through the dog door and sprinted for him, rubbing her head and neck against his shins as he squatted. The motion-sensor light kicked on, bathing them in a soft glow.
“She’s adorable,” Anna said.
“Do you have a question for me, Ms. Downey?”
“C’mon, call me Anna.”
He said nothing. She thought for a long time, Austin staring up at her as he pet Run’s soft fur. He resented the fact that she’d ruined what would have been the best moment of his day. But what she’d said had him wondering: what if she was right? One thing he knew was that the behavior of killers was a lot less predictable than it looked on TV crime dramas. Even cold, calculating serial killers made mistakes, acted out of resentment, desperation, and sheer stupidity. And Anna was right that, on occasion, it was good for the public to know the details of a case in progress. Sometimes it led to tips that broke cases. So it was certainly possible that the photo would bring another break in the case. More often, stories like the one she was about to publish led killers to dispose of their victims and flee the state.
Anna leaned over the fence, her face half in the light, half in shadow. “You arrested Lorraine D’Antonia for the murder of Sonya Lopez in New York. She confessed to all the known murders committed by the so called Holiday Baby Butcher in Seattle. Johnathan Gruber, and three others, right?”
“Right.”
“I guess my question is this: Is there any chance she was lying? Any chance you were wrong? Any chance the real killer has been on the loose this whole time?”
He stood and walked to the door. Run followed. In the doorway he paused just long enough to say, “No. There is no chance of that.”
* * *
Austin tossed and turned for an hour before falling into a restless, haunted sleep.
In his dreams, he saw bones.
First, the bones of Jonathan Gruber sitting in a bag next to Green Lake in Seattle. July Fourth weekend. Red, white, and blue, covered in stars and stripes, the bag floated through his mind like a ghost.
Next he saw the bones of Shaneequa Jackson. It was early April of 2015 and her bones had been found in an Easter Basket just south of Seattle’s famous Pike Place market. He hadn’t seen these bones in person, hadn’t worked these cases. He only knew them from the photographs he’d seen when Lorraine D’Antonia emerged in New York a few years after going dark in Seattle.
Her victim was tiny Sonya Lopez, a premature baby who’d only been home from the hospital for six days when she went missing. The day after Christmas, a homeless man had found the bones outside a bodega in the Bronx, stuffed into a decorative holiday gift bag.
It was still dark out when Austin rolled out of bed and staggered to the kitchen. It was 5:30 AM, which meant he’d gotten maybe three hours of sleep. It would have to do. He put on a pot of coffee, watching jets of steam stream out from cracks in the plastic casing, and listening to the hisses and gurgles in the otherwise silent house. He needed a new coffee pot.
Run looked up at him expectantly. Her big eyes communicated an intelligence he’d never seen in a dog. He wasn’t sure if it was because he’d grown more appreciative of animal intelligence, or if she was just a remarkable dog. Maybe both.
He knelt and gave her a treat, then nodded to the dog bed in the corner. “Bed.”
She eyed the bag of treats, then reluctantly retreated to the bed and lay down.
He felt like he’d been gone for days, maybe weeks. He felt different, and yet Fiona’s old plaque hung exactly where he’d left it on the wall.
Every single second,
Of every single day,
Every victim deserves my best.
He thought about her, about what she’d say if she knew he was chasing a clone of the Holiday Baby Butcher. Most likely, she’d tell him not to overthink it, to keep going to work, and to look up at the plaque whenever he got discouraged.
He wouldn’t read the article, but by now Anna’s story would have ‘gone viral,’ as Andy liked to say. The FBI would be on the line with Sheriff Daniels. National press would be on their way to Kitsap County. And, more importantly, if Joshua Green was still alive, his captor had a reason to become more unpredictable.
He poured himself a cup of coffee, watered it down with some cool water from the tap, and chugged it like a bottle of Gatorade after a long walk in the desert.
This was going to be a helluva day.
