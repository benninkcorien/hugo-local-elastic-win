Chapter 28
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Austin thought he’d be the first to arrive, but Ridley was already refilling his coffee cup when Austin walked in. Then he remembered that Ridley had slept in the office.
The first light of dawn had cut through the clouds, casting a dull gray light through the window and into the dingy conference room.
Ridley had texted Austin, Lucy, and Jimmy at six in the morning, telling them to get into the office as soon as possible. His plan was to get them all out in the field before Sheriff Daniels arrived and had the chance to slow them down or, worse, tell them to pass all their information to the FBI.
Austin had stopped into the café for five minutes before coming in, just long enough to chat with Andy—who was happy to be getting all the overtime hours, especially at such a slow time of year—and to set up Run’s doggie bed behind the counter. He figured it was going to be another long one, and Run was well-behaved enough to hang out in the café while Andy worked. Most of the regulars knew her, and loved her as much as he did. Plus, she’d be the recipient of any special scraps he produced—a half slice of bacon here, a nibble of cheese there.
Without as much as a hello, Ridley began talking through every lead, every angle, and dividing up the tasks for the day. He started with the address Trisha had been given in Seattle. As she’d said, it was a grocery store. Still, he’d asked a colleague in the SPD to head over there to ask some questions when they opened, in case there was some connection to the case.
A minor breakthrough had come from an early-morning call with Joshua Green’s parents. When asked specifically about any nurses who might have struck them as odd, they remembered an older woman, late fifties or early sixties. Their description matched Trisha’s, but came with a little more detail. The nurse they remembered was thin, with dark brown hair that looked dyed, and a sharp nose. They didn’t remember the name Mary Bonner, but there was no doubt. They said she’d hovered a little too close, cared a little too much, asked a few too many questions. It had been the happiest day of their life, so it hadn’t struck them as odd at the time. But in retrospect, she’d seemed much more interested in them and their child than the other nurses.
From the hospital, Ridley had received a photo of Mary Bonner, but it hadn’t been a great help. They didn’t store the ones taken for name badges permanently, so all they had was one their security team had pulled from hospital surveillance cameras. It was at a weird angle and, because she was wearing a face mask, not a lot of help. Still, it confirmed the description given by both Trisha and the Greens.
Lucy entered, carrying a massive Starbucks cup and whistling a tune.
“Lucy O’Latte,” Austin offered, weakly.
Lucy offered a tired smile. “It’s a mocha, but not a bad effort, New York.”
Ridley’s phone rang and Austin watched his face as he listened. Hopeful, then even more hopeful, then blank. Then a disappointed scowl.
Ridley ended the call. “TaskRabbit app finally came through. Once we gave them the name and address of Mary Bonner, their lawyers told them they could confirm that the account Trish was interacting with belonged to her.” He paused, then suddenly struck the table with a single open palm, the sound echoing through the little room. “Bastards! If they’d told us that two days ago… just her name alone and we…” He squeezed his bald head together with both hands like he was trying to pop a watermelon in a strongman contest. “If Joshua Green dies…”
“He won’t,” Austin said. “We’re close. Let’s get back to it.”
Ridley took a few deep breaths, then nodded in Austin’s direction.
“Everything comes down to one thing,” Austin said. “Location. We need to find Mary Bonner.”
“I have something,” Lucy said.
She paused when Jimmy came through the door carrying a Starbucks cup and one of those shaker bottles people bring to the gym. It was filled with some disgusting-looking liquid, greenish brown and slimy. “Sorry I’m late.”
“It’s 6:30 in the morning,” Ridley said. “No one’s late.”
Austin noticed that Jimmy was wearing the same clothes as yesterday, khaki slacks and a blue jacket over a wrinkled white shirt. He also noticed that Jimmy didn’t say anything to Lucy, didn’t make eye contact.
Ridley waved in Lucy’s general direction. “What do you have?”
“Five minutes ago,” Lucy said. “Call from patrol outside Myrian Brightstone’s house. She just got dropped off by an Uber.”
“That’s big,” Austin said.
“I told them not to approach her, but not to let her leave. They said she was staggering like she was drunk—getting back from a bender—so she’s probably passed out. I figure Austin and I head over there?”
Ridley nodded. “Jimmy, you’re gonna head up the Hansville search. Every single house on or off NE 360th, then start spreading out from there. If we’re lucky, we knock on a door and find Mary Bonner. Even if we’re not, maybe someone saw her drop the bag of bones there for Trisha.”
Jimmy nodded. “Speaking of Hansville. I wasn’t going to bring this up, but Samantha emailed me this morning. It’s a stretch, to be sure, but, well—”
“Spit it out,” Ridley said.
“In the four hours since Anna Downey’s article dropped, online discussion of the Lorraine D’Antonia case has exploded. Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, message boards, true crime sites, and so on.”
Ridley waved him along like a man directing traffic. “As expected. So?”
“Right,” Jimmy agreed. “But she ran a word usage AI, with an interesting result.”
Austin stared at him. “What’s that?” He couldn’t help but notice what appeared to be the edge of a hickey barely visible when Jimmy turned and his shirt collar dipped slightly. Combined with the fact that Lucy, too, had a Starbucks cup, and that they’d arrived at almost the same time—spacing their entrances to appear as though they hadn’t come together… Maybe their relationship wasn’t as over as Lucy had made it sound.
“Ever seen those word cloud things?” Jimmy asked.
“No,” Austin and Ridley said at once.
“Think of it like this: Samantha is able to use an AI to track common phrases and words in online discussions of the case, then compare it to word usages in known facts via the case files. Filtering out common words and phrases, like ‘it’ or the name of victims, for example.”
“What’s she looking for?” Austin asked.
“Anomalies. Words and phrases that don’t belong. Essentially, it’s using the wisdom of crowds to figure out if we’re overlooking something.”
Lucy took a loud sip of coffee. “‘Anomalies’ is a pretty big word for a meathead.”
Jimmy ignored her comment, but gave her a raised-eyebrow look that confirmed Austin’s suspicions. They were one of those on-and-off couples that were half passion, half derision.
“So,” Jimmy continued, “no one outside this room, Trisha, and her lawyer know about the 360th street thing yet. Everyone is talking about Hansville because Anna’s story mentioned the location where the bones were found. But even when she excluded discussions posted after Anna’s article came out, she found that Hansville came up way more than it should have, statistically speaking.”
“What the hell does that mean?” Ridley asked, his annoyance matching Austin’s. He knew the case as well as anyone, and Hansville had never come up. Before moving to New York, D’Antonia had kidnapped her victims in Seattle, killed them in Seattle, and left the bones in Seattle. As far as he knew, there was no connection between Lorraine D’Antonia and the sleepy little beach town he called home.
Jimmy stood up and pulled out his phone. “By itself, nothing. But when she started reviewing individual mentions… Here. Two years ago, a comment on a true crime message board: ‘I went to high school with the Holiday Baby Butcher in Seattle and even spent a weekend at her parents’ cabin in Hansville. Creepy AF.’”
“You’re citing a random internet comment?” Austin asked, trying to keep the bite out of his tone. “There are no records of her parents having a cabin in Hansville. If there were, I would have found them.”
Not to mention, he never would have moved there.
Jimmy took a big swig of coffee. “What about this, from September of this year: ‘I met her parents, Maria and Mark D’Antonia, on a fishing trip in Hansville. Can’t remember when, but they couldn’t stop talking about their lovely adopted baby girl so it must’ve been right around the time they got her. I was fishing next to the parents of evil.” He held up a hand before Austin could object. “On its own, it’s not much.”
“Not much?” Austin objected. “Maybe D’Antonia’s parents went fishing in Hansville once. Maybe they even had a little cabin there under a different name, or maybe it was a friend’s cabin they used every now and then. How does that help us catch Mary Bonner?”
Ridley said, “It doesn’t, but it’s also not irrelevant, since the bones were both picked up and found in Hansville.” He cocked his head to the side. “Hate to say it, but Jimmy’s right.” He stood and walked a slow lap around the conference table. “We need to find Mary Bonner. Today. Lucy and Austin, head out to see Myrian Brightstone.” He waved in the direction of the bad photo of Bonner, which he’d taped to the wall. “Don’t leave until you have either a good photo of her, or a sketch.”
“Already have a sketch guy from the college on standby,” Lucy said. “He said it’s his kid’s birthday, but he’s ready.”
“Jimmy, you and I will head out to Hansville. If Mary Bonner is there, we will find her. If she was there, we’ll get her car, or something.”
He looked at each of them, one by one. “We good?”
Austin tapped the table. “Let’s do this.”
