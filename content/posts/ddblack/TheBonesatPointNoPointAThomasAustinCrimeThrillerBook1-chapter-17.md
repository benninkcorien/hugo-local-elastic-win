Chapter 16
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Back in the office, Austin sat alone in the conference room, staring at the picture of Joshua Green taped to the wall. The missing boy had a chubby face, pink-beige skin, and a few straggles of brown hair. He was adorable in the way most babies were—cute and innocent without a lot of striking features yet, a generic cuteness that reminded him of the Gerber baby.
The week before she died, Fiona had told him she was ready to have children. He’d wanted to be a dad for years and they’d waited a long time, choosing to focus on their careers. Fiona was thirty-nine when she died, on track to be the DA of Manhattan. From there, the sky was the limit. Austin wouldn’t have been surprised if she’d ended up as the governor of New York, or the Attorney General for the United States. She was that smart, that savvy, and that good at her job. But she’d decided to take a year off, maybe two, to have a child. She wanted to be as good at that as she was at everything else. Plus, she’d always talked about writing crime novels, and had gone deep into a fantasy about a new life. “You can keep fighting crime,” she’d said. “I’ll be a mom and write about crime. If that doesn’t work out, the district attorney’s office will always be there for me.” In a moment of retro nostalgia, she’d even picked up a yellow Olivetti Lettera typewriter from the 1970s. Austin had teased her that he was supposed to be the luddite in the family, but she’d insisted she was going to write an entire novel on the thing. It now sat on a small rolltop desk in the corner of his living room, holding a single sheet of paper and the opening paragraphs of what was going to be her novel.
A lot of people talked about having it all—the job, the creative outlet, the family life. She was one of the ones who could have pulled it off. They’d had some rocky patches in the early years of their marriage, but the five years before she died had been better than he thought possible. Austin had been in awe of her, and happy to be along for the ride. It had been a year and he still couldn't believe that all he had of her now was a plaque, a typewriter, and his memories.
The door swung open and Detective Calvin strode in, followed by Lucy and finally Jimmy, who left the door open behind him.
“Nice work on that phone,” Ridley said. “Sheriff is pissed at both of us, but damn, that’s a helluva get.” He made his voice higher and a little slurred, waving his arms randomly. “Detective Calvin, DO NOT let that New York cowboy loose on Kingston again.”
“I don’t even have a gun,” Austin said, cutting through the laughter. “Anyway, I’m just pissed I didn’t catch up with her.”
The tiny chihuahua burst through the door like a rat sprung from its cage, sprinting despite heavily favoring her broken leg. She looked around nervously, then bolted over to Jimmy, who reached down and cupped her in his hands as she tried to spring onto his lap. “Aww, Itsy-Bitsy, who’s a good dog?”
Next to Jimmy’s meaty hands and bulging biceps, Itsy looked even tinier. She curled herself into a ball and tucked away on his lap.
Ridley said, “We’re waiting on Animal Control. They’ll hold her until we track down Trisha.”
“If she ends up in jail,” Lucy said to Jimmy, “you should take her.”
“You like a man with a puppy?”
“She’s three years old. Not a puppy.”
“She’s as little as a puppy.”
Lucy sighed. “And you’re as smart as one.”
Jimmy frowned.
“Actually, I take it back.” Lucy cocked her head. “I wouldn’t want to insult puppies that way.”
Jimmy pet Itsy gently and she rolled onto her back, eyes closed. Austin missed Run.
Ridley rapped on the whiteboard with his knuckles. “Can we get back to it?” Before waiting for a reply, he continued. “Here’s the deal: every available car in the county is looking for Trisha. We’re watching her cellphone, hoping for some sort of notification that clues us into something. We’re looking into TaskRabbit—apparently they’re a… Well, Jimmy, you explain it.”
Jimmy handed Itsy to Lucy and tapped at his phone. A moment later, the screen on the TV popped on and a website appeared. TaskRabbit was written in big silver and red letters, below which were photos of happy-looking people staring at their phones.
“This is their homepage,” Jimmy said. “Basically, it’s an app where you sign up for random odd jobs, sort of like Uber, but for tasks. Sign up, get verified, then you’re notified of tasks that need completing in your area. Like $40 to courier an envelope across town. Or $80 to wait for the cable guy from noon to four. Or $15 to take a dog on a half-hour walk. Everyone who uses it has to show a driver’s license, and people get reviewed, so the users know who to trust.” He tapped through to a different page. “This is her profile. Trisha Simone.”
Austin saw a picture of the woman he’d chased through Kingston. In the photo, her hair was tied back in a ponytail and she had on a good amount of makeup. Her smile revealed crooked and yellowing teeth, but she looked friendly and professional enough. Her location was listed as “Kitsap and King counties.”
Jimmy said, “We don’t have any addresses for her in King County. My guess, she just ferried over there to do tasks sometimes.”
Austin asked, “And we’re in touch with the app?”
“Yeah,” Ridley said. “They confirmed that she has an account and does tasks for them. Confirmed her name and whatnot. When it came to giving us a list of work she’d done, her clients, they stonewalled, said they’d have to check with their lawyers. ‘Protecting the privacy of their valued customers.’”
Austin sighed. “This might be a place to get the FBI involved. Back in New York, when we had kidnapping cases, we sometimes coordinated with the FBI to get things moving. Three dudes in dark suits is more intimidating than a bunch of locals.”
“Hey,” Lucy said, petting the dog, “I can be intimidating. Yes, yes, yes… can’t we Itsy-bitsy, can’t we? We’re very intimidating.”
“No offense,” Austin said.
Ridley tapped a marker on the whiteboard. “I’ll talk to Sheriff Daniels about that. There’s more on Trisha. She’s got a record. Marijuana possession, back when it was illegal. Stole a car in the nineties.” He set down the marker and tossed a file folder on the table between them.
Austin began rummaging through the file, which contained her police record. “Long way from stealing babies.”
Ridley nodded in agreement. “We need to keep an open mind here. The fact that she dropped the bones at the beach and looks a little like Lorraine D’Antonia is too much to be a coincidence, but we still don’t know what this is.”
A young woman poked her head in the door. “New message on the phone. Thought you’d want to see it.” She had a friendly round face, straight black hair, and a tattoo of Chinese calligraphy climbing up her forearm. From the look of her, she might have been only twenty. Like Lucy, her skin was fairly pale, like she didn’t even go out in the small amount of sun the area offered.
Ridley waved in her general direction. “Austin, this is Samantha. Tech intern. She runs our social media and helps out with stuff even Jimmy is too old to understand. Samantha, Austin is—”
“I know.” She smiled sadly. “Sorry about your wife.”
“How did you—” He stopped mid-sentence. “Google?”
She nodded. “I do a cursory search on anyone before meeting them. Started doing it with dates, now, well, I like to be prepared.”
Jimmy said, “She’s an honors student in criminal justice at Olympic College. Taught me half of what I know about tech.”
Samantha smiled. “Three quarters. And actually I’m doing forensic science with a self-designed minor in digital forensics.” She noticed Austin’s blank stare. “Digital forensics? Everyone knows that people leave clues based on their online activity, right? Facebook posts, location tags if they’re stupid enough to leave those on while committing a crime. But the really good stuff you need access to their phone or computer to get. Emails, Google searches, and so on. I specialize in getting the good stuff before we get warrants for their phones and computers.”
“Hacking?” Austin asked.
She shook her head. “That’s illegal. Everything I do is one hundred percent legal. Using AI to comb through files and internet databases. Trends in public blockchain transactions, facial recognition and license plate recognition software on public photographs. You’d be shocked at how much evidence people give up in the background of their Instagram selfies. And, of course, when we do get into a phone, then it’s on like Donkey Kong.”
Austin could feel himself aging in real time. As much as he wanted to believe that his old-school ways were superior, it was hard to deny that people like Samantha were crucial to the future of investigations. “Good to meet you.”
“So what have you got?” Ridley asked.
Samantha held up Trisha’s phone. “New notification.”
“Tell me something good,” Austin said.
“Nothing major, but interesting. Text from someone named David: How’s Itsy? Can’t wait to see her. Tomorrow at 5 PM. Kingston Waterfront. Sounded kinda coded. I looked up every codeword for marijuana and no one has ever called it Itsy, not that I could find anyway. Figured maybe Itsy was Trisha’s codename?”
Jimmy cupped his face in his hands.
Lucy laughed loudly. “Guess we should have told you.” She held up the dog. “Meet Itsy.”
Samantha stared at the phone. “That makes a lot more sense. Okay, back to the dungeon for me.”
“Kingston waterfront at five tomorrow,” Ridley said when Samantha had left. “We’ll have someone there, though I doubt she’ll show. Maybe this guy David will.”
Jimmy said, “I’ve got something else.” The TV screen changed to a news article from the Seattle Times dated three months earlier. “I’ve been running a series of searches, combing the internet for anything new on The Baby Butcher. In the last year, there were multiple mentions of her in articles about the agency that set up her adoption when she was a baby.
The headline on the screen read “Johnson Hill Adoption Agency Sued for Inappropriate Placements, Fraud.”
Ridley said, “What’s the point, Jimmy? Lorraine D’Antonia is behind bars. I appreciate the thoroughness, but what does it matter if her adoption agency is getting sued for some shady shit sixty years ago?”
“Well, the article says that two families are suing them for promising to put children with well-off families but leaving them in poverty. Something about collecting state money.“
Austin tapped his foot impatiently. “Any connection to Lorraine or her birth or adoptive parents?”
“No,” Jimmy admitted. “But I’m telling you, sometimes algorithms know more about what’s going on than we do.”
“Stay on it,” Ridley said. “But our priority is getting into that phone.”
Itsy sat up suddenly and yelped, as though waking from a bad dream.
“Looks like she doesn’t want us getting into that phone,” Lucy said.
“Luckily for us,” Ridley said, “it’s up to a judge and not a dog. I’ll hear back by tomorrow. Cell phone warrants are tough, but I’ll get it.”
The woman who worked at the front desk came in. “Sheriff Daniels would like to see you,” she said to Ridley. She turned to Austin. “And you.”
“How does he seem?” Ridley asked.
She smiled. “I’d never say anything bad behind my employer’s back, but if you’ve got Kevlar vests, I’d wear them to the meeting.”
