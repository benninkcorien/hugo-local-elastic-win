Chapter 24
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
Everyone hunched around the small screen to read. For half a second, Austin wondered when reading year-old Facebook comments had become so relevant to detective work, but denying it would be like pursuing a fleeing suspect in a horse-drawn carriage.
The exchange under the photograph started out fine before descending into what read like high school gossip and bullying. Austin had a pretty good understanding of the dark side of human nature. It had been his job for two decades. But he’d never be able to understand a world where otherwise normal people treated others like this, in writing, in public.
Jessie Johnson: Ooh, I love this photo. Fun night!
Myrian Brightstone: Samesies! We gotta get the girls together more often.
Keeran Smith: Girls? What about me?
Myrian Brightstone: Sorry, Keeran, you’re one of the girls now. You can take Mary’s place.
Keeran Smith: Where’d she go, anyway?
Jessie Johnson: Left early. Doesn’t drink.
Myrian Brightstone: Left early ‘cause she’s a weirdo is more like it.
Keeran Smith: Myrian, don’t.
Myrian Brightstone: No, I’m sorry. Someone has to say it.
Keeran Smith: It doesn’t have to be here, tho.
Jessie Johnson: Keeran, she’s not wrong. That whole conversation was weird AF.
Myrian Brightstone: Weird? It was disturbing, and I honestly don’t care WHO sees this. I was trying to have fun at a party and get my drank on. Talk about a buzzkill.
Keeran Smith: Not saying you’re wrong, but she’s literally tagged in this photo.
Myrian Brightstone: Wouldn’t even be IN the photo, you think she’s gonna look at Facebook? I’m sorry, but I’m so DONE with her. Creepy. Old. And WTF was that shit at the end? How do you spend five minutes of a Christmas party talking about a serial killer?
Jessie Johnson: I know, right? She was talking about it like of course we should all know already. I never even heard about it.
Myrian Brightstone: How dare you, Jessie!?! LOL. How dare you not want to discuss The Holiday Baby Butcher at your company Christmas party. LOLOL. And that schmaltzy poetry she posts in the breakroom before every holiday? GOD AWFUL!
For a long moment, everyone sat in silence. Stunned silence. It was Ridley who eventually spoke. “Samantha, excellent work. You may have just broken this case. But we don’t have time for a victory lap. Who’s this Keeran Smith?”
Samantha closed her laptop. “Another nurse who works there.”
Ridley turned to Jimmy. “Get addresses for him and Jessie Johnson. Send patrol over there to question them about Mary Bonner.” Jimmy nodded and raced out of the room.
Austin stood, shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans, and paced. “Tell me if you’re with me. So Mary Bonner is working at the hospital. Judging by this exchange, she’s obsessed with the case, like most copycats. She meets the parents of Allie Shreever, maybe she’s working the night she’s born. Likely, she gathers information at the hospital. Home address, and so on. Maybe she even scopes out the house while the parents are still in the hospital. Maybe she learns they’re gonna have their child in a crib in a separate room. She’d confirm this before deciding on a child. She’d want to know for certain that this kid won’t be co-sleeping with the parents. She kidnaps Allie—and we don’t yet know what happened for the three days she had her—then kills her, does the poem on the bones, and then—”
“Then hires Trisha through TaskRabbit to drop the bones.” Ridley was right there with him.
“Somehow,” Austin continued, “she does all this without missing work or calling attention to herself.”
“Or,” Lucy said, “the entire ordeal—the three days—were days Bonner was scheduled to be off anyway. I’ll have Samantha check her work records against the dates of Allie’s disappearance.”
“Good thinking,” Ridley said.
“Right,” Austin agreed. “A few weeks later, she figures she’s gotten away with it, she repeats the exact same process with Joshua Green. But this time, something changes. Instead of continuing at her job, she disappears.”
Lucy stood. “What changed was Anna’s story about the possible connections between the cases. Once she saw that, she knew it was a matter of time before we knocked on her door.”
Ridley moved to the door. “You two wait here, I’m gonna get us a warrant for Mary Bonner’s place. This, plus what we already have, will be more than enough.” He stopped in the doorway. “One more thing: you two think it’s a coincidence that Trisha slightly resembles D’Antonia, or is that part of it?”
“Good question,” Austin said.
Ridley shrugged and left.
Austin’s head spun. He looked at Lucy, then at Itsy, who was sleeping in the corner.
Before he could convince himself not to, he leapt up, grabbed Itsy, and raced down the hall to the interview room. Busting through the door, he saw Trisha talking to the public defender who’d just arrived to counsel her.
The lawyer stood immediately. “I’m in a meeting with my client.” He was a young guy with a cheap suit and a buzzcut, no more than two years out of law school.
Austin waved a hand at him dismissively. “This’ll just take a sec. Trisha, look at me.”
She reached out pathetically and burst into tears when she saw her dog. Seeing Trisha, Itsy let out a series of high-pitched yelps and turned its head nearly backwards attempting to bite Austin.
“We know you didn’t take any kids,” Austin said. “I don’t think you even knew what was in that bag. You’re just a down-on-her-luck weed dealer who did odd jobs to pay for her dog’s surgery.”
“Don’t say anything,” the lawyer commanded her. Then, turning to Austin. “You’re completely out of line. Detective, get this guy out of here.”
Ridley had appeared behind him and Austin felt his large hands on his shoulders.
“Someone paid you to drop off that bag. We know who. Maybe she approached you first through the TaskRabbit app? I’m guessing you did a job for her, then later she reached out with a special job, extra pay?”
The lawyer now slid to the side, physically blocking his client from Austin. “Don’t answer that!”
Austin crouched and let Itsy down. Immediately, the tiny dog sprinted across the room, through the lawyer’s legs, and leapt into Trisha’s arms.
“Trisha!” Austin blurted. “Answer me!”
She was in tears now, relief and pain all over her face.
“I’m betting she reached out to you outside the app, doubling, even tripling your pay. Probably by phone, nothing in writing. Tell us who paid you to drop off that bag and we can work with you.” He scowled at the lawyer. “Get her to talk or that baby’s blood will be on your hands, too.”
He pushed Ridley out the door and slammed it behind them with a force that shook the walls.
