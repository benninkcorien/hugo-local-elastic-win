Chapter 6
CHAPTER SIX
Austin took a slow sip, sucking air into his mouth to cool the scalding hot coffee. Something was wrong with the temperature control on the pot. It kept the coffee just below boiling and gave it a bitter, burnt taste. He considered going to the store to grab an iced coffee from the cold case, but he’d slept badly and needed the caffeine immediately. He added a spritz of cold water from the faucet.
Run scrambled in through the dog door and nudged her nose against his shin repeatedly to get his attention. He crouched down to pet her, but she quickly leapt back and grabbed a ball from the floor, then dropped it dramatically at his feet. She was the smartest, most active dog he’d ever met, and she wasn’t much for cuddling. But in the year he’d had her, she’d never once gotten tired of chasing anything he threw. He opened the sliding glass door and tossed the ball into the small, fenced-in yard.
When she raced out to find it, he looked up to the plaque hanging above the coffeemaker. It looked like the kind of thing you’d get from your boss to commemorate five years on the job. It was faux-wood, the lacquer faded, and stamped with a metal plate where three lines of words had been etched:
Every single second,
Of every single day,
Every victim deserves my best.
On her first day in the DA’s office, Fiona had ordered it from an online store that did custom trophies and plaques. She’d placed it on her desk next to a single plant and a picture from their wedding. For six years, she’d lived that motto. And for longer than that, it had been what they both believed.
Now it was just a plaque, a memory. Austin had never stopped believing it. But when he went back to his job after getting out of the hospital, he’d no longer been able to live it. Whatever it was that had allowed him to care enough to do his job well had died along with Fiona.
After reading the poems on the bones of little Allie Shreever, Austin had told Detective Calvin that he’d be willing to answer any questions they had by phone, but he was not interested in anything official. He’d had enough of police work and had moved three thousand miles to get away from it. He was content selling bait, beer, and burgers to locals in the winter and the swarms of visitors and returning snowbirds in the summer.
Run busted through the dog door and dropped the ball with a flourish before doing a full 360 spin in excitement. Austin added a little more tap water to his coffee, swigged it, and put the cup in the sink. He held up his empty hands and turned them back and forth like a magician proving the object had disappeared. “Sorry, Run, all done.”
Run gave him her best wide-eyed-cuteness stare, then retreated to the living room to gnaw on a bone.
Austin tossed on a jacket and eased out the back door, crossing the one road through town and slipping in through the unlocked back door of the West Sound Community Church. The door led into a small storage room, which opened into a kitchenette. Austin walked through the darkness, holding his breath, and made his way into the nave, an area about six-hundred square feet, with ten rows of seating. He sat on a wooden pew in the back row and closed his eyes, though all the lights in the place were off. Finally releasing his breath, he inhaled deeply.
And, just like that, Fiona was back.
His parents had brought him to church every now and then as a kid, but he’d lost touch with it in college and had never gone as an adult. He’d told Fiona once that after seeing the kinds of things he saw on the job, going to church just didn’t make sense any more. She’d replied that after seeing the kind of things she’d seen on the job, going to church was one of the only things that made sense. They’d agreed to disagree, but he’d come with her on Christmas Eve every year. He didn’t come now because she’d want him to. He came because of the smell.
He opened his eyes when he heard the gentle swoosh of a broom on a wooden floor. Looking up, he saw Pastor Johnson coming toward him, sweeping as he inched up the aisle. “Thought I heard you come in,” the Pastor said. “What is this, three days in a row now?” He was an older man, likely seventies from the wrinkles on his face, but as spry and active as Austin himself. In addition to running a food bank and countless community meetings, he was an amateur photographer, known in the community for his stunning pictures of sunrises over the Cascades and sunsets over the Olympics.
“Four,” Austin said. “I hope it’s no bother.”
“Not at all. We’d love to see you at regular service, but, well, I understand.”
“Thank you.”
“You stay as long as you need.”
“Thank you.”
The Pastor began sweeping again, but stopped, leaning on the broom. “How does it work, with your wife?”
Austin said, “You know how you can smell something, like your grandma’s old sweater, and be transported back to a memory? Sitting on her lap as a child, or standing next to her on the porch. Smells carry memories. Most people experience that.”
“For me it’s instant coffee. We drink the fancy stuff now, but I was raised by my grandpa and he drank Folger’s all day every day. Maybe ten cups. One whiff and I’m back in his kitchen.”
“Right, most people have something like that.”
“But for you it’s different?”
“First time I walked in here, my wife was back with me. My senses kind of cross over each other. Usually with tastes and words and feelings. When I’m here, something in the air—maybe the age of the wood mixed with the paint, mixed with… I don’t know. Usually I can pinpoint it. Here I can’t.”
“What do you feel?”
“What do I feel?” Austin wasn’t one to talk much about his feelings. Anyone else who’d asked, he would have given a look, that New Yorker look that implied, this conversation is over. But Pastor Johnson left the place unlocked for him, let him sneak in and sit as long as he wanted, and had never been anything but kind. “You do photography, right?”
Pastor Johnson nodded.
“Imagine you’re out at dawn, all by yourself, just you and the camera. Maybe it rained the day before, but now it’s clear so everything is fresh and clean. You stroll along the beach, a few birds chirping, a bright white sailboat gliding by. Then the first glow of sunrise creeps over the mountains to the east, bathing you in golden light. How do you feel?”
Pastor Johnson smiled sadly, but said nothing.
“That’s how I feel when I’m here. That’s how it used to feel with Fiona.”
The pastor held his eye for a moment, then nodded and went back to sweeping.

Andy handled the café’s breakfast crowd—if it could be called ‘a crowd’—on his own. Today, Mr. and Mrs. McGuilicutty were the only two patrons, both hunched over the exact same breakfast they ordered every day: two scrambled eggs, two pieces of toast burned black, a single strip of bacon each, and coffee so sweet Andy had to refill the sugar dispenser at their regular table twice as often as the others.
“Morning, New York.” That’s what Mr. McGuilicutty always called him, despite the fact that he’d lived in San Diego, Virginia, Connecticut, and pretty much every other state with a Navy base.
“Morning,” Austin replied, slapping him on the back. “Andy taking good care of you?”
Mrs. McGuilicutty crunched her blackened toast. “They say burnt toast’ll give you cancer. Look at me. I’m ninety-one!”
“She is,” Mr. McGuilicutty said. “Ain’t that right. And I’m ninety-four.” He waved a piece of burnt toast in the air. “I could beat you in a footrace right now, I could!”
“Oh, no!” Mrs. McGuilicutty’s eyes were on the TV above the bar.
“Oh yes, I could beat him,” Mr. McGuilicutty insisted. “My legs are strong as—”
“No, look at the TV.” Mrs. McGuilicutty waved her toast toward the screen.
Austin let his gaze drift up. The TV was usually tuned to sports—Mariners, Seahawks, UW, and Mystics games. Today it was the local news, which Austin tried to avoid the way he tried to avoid everything that wasn’t his dog or his business.
The knot in his stomach returned in a flash as he read the scroll along the bottom of the screen: Newborn kidnapped from home in upscale Bainbridge Island neighborhood.
