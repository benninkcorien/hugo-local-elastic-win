Chapter 13
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Ten minutes later, they pulled up in front of an apartment building a few blocks from the ferry in Kingston. It was a newer construction, five stories, holding twenty or thirty units, some of which looked out at the town’s marina.
Austin threw open the door, ready to go.
Lucy put a hand on his shoulder. “Wait here. Ridley’s orders.”
Austin wanted to object, but he’d agreed to stay out of any situation beyond research, meetings, and interviews. He wasn’t a detective, wasn’t licensed as a private investigator, and Sheriff Daniels had insisted he sign a half dozen waivers just to act as a consultant. “If she’s there—”
“You’ll be in on the interview. I promise.”
Detective Calvin had been at the hospital when Lucy called him. They’d agreed that she should head over to the apartment while he stopped to get a warrant for Trisha Simone’s apartment and truck. A patrol car in the area had met them at the apartment building.
Austin watched from the car as Lucy hopped out and positioned one officer at the front door, waving another around the side of the building, presumably to stake out the back. Then she disappeared into the lobby of the apartment building.
Austin scrolled through the photos of cars Jimmy had sent earlier. They were low quality, but good enough for him to feel more certain than ever that Trisha Simone’s old truck had backfired on the morning Benny and Sarah found the bones on the beach. All the other cars were much newer, and none had the look of a car that had been customized to backfire. He thought about trying to find the suspect on Facebook as Lucy had, but he didn't have the app on his phone and wasn’t entirely sure how it worked. It wasn’t that he didn’t see the investigative value of combing through people’s social media, but in the NYPD, he’d worked with a partner who’d handled that side of investigations.
He scanned the parking lot idly, then glanced up at the windows of the apartment building, then watched the officer out front, who paced in front of the door.
Letting his gaze fall again to the parking lot, his eyes stopped on a truck. He looked again at the document, then back at the truck. That wasn’t a truck. It was the truck. 1980 Chevy, brown and yellow.
He really ought to let Lucy know, but Austin had learned in the NYPD that he could get a lot more done by asking for forgiveness, rather than permission.
He got out of the car and crossed the lot, glancing back at the apartment building every few paces. As he approached, he saw that the truck was empty. But even so, his pulse quickened, his breaths came a little louder, the hairs on his neck prickled, and he tasted the unmistakable tang of tart cherries. As much as he’d wanted out of this line of work, he couldn’t deny that he loved the chase.
* * *
Lucy had decided to take the stairs. Trisha Simone’s truck was registered to apartment 4A, and Lucy figured that if she and Austin were spotted from the window, she might try to escape via the stairs. Plus, Lucy tried to always take the stairs—anything she could do to hit her 10,000 steps per day.
Two flights up, she wondered whether she was making a mistake. She could have left the officer off the back door and had him accompany her up. That might have been safer. After all, if Joshua Green was inside this apartment, Trisha would do anything to escape, including killing her. She should have waited for backup, but it was too late now.
After all, the chances were slim that she’d come out, guns blazing. Even if she was home, which she might not be.
She let out a long breath as she passed the landing on the third floor.
She was doing this.
* * *
Pure excitement. The feeling that something big was happening. A piece of a puzzle falling into place.
Austin checked the truck bed—empty except for a few dead leaves, a little gravel, and an empty Starbucks cup.
He peered through dirty glass into the cab. More empty coffee cups, loose rolling papers, a couple ancient French fries wedged between the seats and center console. A sun-bleached ferry ticket from a few days ago sat on the dusty dashboard. If this was their copycat, she certainly hadn’t copied everything about Lorraine D’Antonia. When Austin and his team had arrested her, they’d marveled at the spotless perfection of her apartment, the way her hair and nails were perfect even though they’d pulled her out of bed to make the arrest. Trisha Simone was a slob. The cabin looked like it would smell of wet diapers, moldy ketchup, and cigarettes. But there were no diapers in sight. Also no baby clothes, no baby blanket, no bottles. In fact, there was no evidence whatsoever that a child had recently been in the car.
* * *
Lucy started with a firm knock-knock-knock. She waited, ear close to the door, listening.
Silence.
She knocked again, louder this time, holding her breath, hand close to her gun. Thud-thud-thud. She’d closed a few big cases, but never anything like this. And she’d never felt like she was in true danger. She’d never once fired her gun in the line of duty.
From behind the door, she heard scratching, like nails on a hardwood floor. She tensed.
Then she heard the high-pitched yelping of what sounded like a tiny dog.
A door opened behind her and she swiveled fast, stepping to the side so she wouldn’t have her back to Trisha’s door.
An old man stood in his doorway, bathrobe half open revealing boxer shorts and a white tank top. “She ain’t home.”
Lucy took a deep breath. “Who?”
“The pothead. Her dog only barks when she’s gone. When she’s here, best-behaved dog you ever saw. When she’s gone, that chihuahua’s a terrorist.”
She held up her badge. “Detective Lucy O’Rourke. Do you know the last time she was here?”
“Yesterday sometime.”
Lucy sidestepped to have a better view of Trisha’s door, just in case. “What can you tell me about her?”
The chihuahua was close to the door now, barking incessantly.
“Not much, she keeps to herself. Not real friendly. I assume you’re here about the weed? I know the hippies in this state made it legal, but she’s not allowed to smoke inside. Building rules.” He shook his head. “Told the owner about it. He don’t care.”
“When you last saw her, did she have a child with her?”
He scratched at a wispy beard. “Child? Her? No. Can’t imagine no one would want to have a kid with her.”
“Have you ever heard a baby crying in the apartment?”
He pointed at the door, where the chihuahua was now clawing and yelping. “Not unless you count that little hellraiser.”
* * *
Austin cast a furtive glance around the parking lot, then tried the driver’s side door. Locked. He could easily jimmy it with a tool from Lucy’s car, but, well, not only would anything he found be inadmissible in any future trial, but given that he was a regular citizen now, it would also be a crime. He shoved his hands in his pockets and scanned the area. The officer still paced by the front door. No signs of life from inside the building.
Turning back toward downtown, he noticed a line of people coming down the sidewalk. Looked like the ferry had docked and folks were making their way into town.
A woman caught his eye. She was about five foot five, with a skinny face and dirty blonde hair. He crouched next to the truck, watching as she sipped coffee from a white cup. A cold breeze tickled his ear and he tasted spice, cayenne pepper. Adrenaline.
It was Trisha.
She stopped across the street from the parking lot, raised a hand to her forehead as though blocking out the sun, then turned suddenly. She’d seen the officer out front.
Her eyes darted to the truck.
Austin stood.
Seeing him, she dropped the coffee, turned, and ran.
