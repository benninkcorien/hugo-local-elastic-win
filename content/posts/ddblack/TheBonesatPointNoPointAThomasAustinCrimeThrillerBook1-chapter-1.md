Epigraph
A Note on Setting
Hansville is a real town, Point No Point a real beach with a famous lighthouse. And while many locations in this book are true to life, some details of the setting have been changed.
Only one character in these pages exists in the real world: Thomas Austinâ€™s corgi, Run. Her personality mirrors that of my own corgi, Pearl. Any other resemblances between characters in this book and actual people is purely coincidental. In other words, I made them all up.
Thanks for reading,
D.D. Black
