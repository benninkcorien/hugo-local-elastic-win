Chapter 8
CHAPTER EIGHT
After a quick stop to feed Run, throw her the ball once or twice, and apologize for not taking her to the beach yet, Austin drove out to the Sheriff’s office.
As he got out of his truck, he spotted a woman on the other end of the parking lot, sitting on the hood of a beat-up old station wagon. She looked as though she’d been lurking, waiting for someone to arrive, because the second he shut the car door she began walking toward him purposefully, eyes locked on his face.
She was around his age, with dirty blond hair and a vaguely Northern European look that was common around here. Fiona had grown up in the area and had a similar look. Like many of the county’s residents, Fiona’s family had come from Europe in the early 1900s—her mom’s side from Ireland, her dad’s side from Sweden. On a trip to visit her parents just after they were married, Fiona had joked that half the women in Kitsap—including herself—looked like nineteenth-century Norwegian farmworkers wearing Nirvana t-shirts. The woman approaching wasn’t wearing a t-shirt—blue jeans and the black puffer jacket that seemed to be the uniform of both women and men in the area—but she had the Norwegian farmworker thing down.
Austin stopped on the curb in front of the door. “Can I help you?”
The woman pulled a pair of sunglasses out of her purse and put them on, blocking out the glare as the sun cut through the clouds for the first time all day. She held a cellphone between them the way reporters used to hold recorders. He knew where this was going.
“I’m Anna Downey, reporter. Any chance I could speak with you about the kidnapping that occurred last night?”
When he was a detective, reporters had generally made Austin’s job harder, though he’d been happy to use them, or let them use him, when it suited his purpose. But after his wife was killed, a special kind of animosity toward reporters had hardened within him. He offered the most polite smile he could manage. “I don’t work here. You’ll want to speak with someone else.”
She pulled off her sunglasses, studying his face, then put them back on. “Are you Thomas Austin, by any chance?”
He stepped back. “How’d you know that?”
“Google.”
He stared at her. “I’m sorry, what paper are you with?”
“I’m not with a paper.”
“You said you were a reporter.”
“Ever heard of the internet?”
He scowled, looking her up and down. She’d unzipped her puffer jacket, revealing a red button-down shirt that would have looked professional in some settings, but looked incongruous with her jeans and tennis shoes. “Yeah, I’ve heard of the internet, but usually reporters identify not only their job, but where they work.”
“I do a weekly column for the Kitsap Union. Online only. It’s a roundup of all the crimes from the week, reports on ongoing investigations, trials, that sort of thing. Basically, I’m the Carrie Bradshaw of Kitsap County crime reporters.”
Austin stared at her blankly, the way he always did when people made references he knew he should get, but didn’t.
She stared back. “She’s, uh, from a show. Sex and the City? You don’t get out much, huh?”
“No.”
“I also do a blog, a podcast, and some freelance stuff. A girl’s gotta eat, right?”
Austin turned to leave, then remembered something. “Wait, how did you know my name?”
She moved into the shadow of the building and took off her sunglasses, presumably for the last time as she stashed them in the pocket of her button down. “I know about the bones in the bag, the ones found on the beach.” She said it casually, as though it was no big deal. “Don’t worry, I’m not gonna write it. Yet. But I know about them, and of course that got me looking into the Baby Butcher, which led me to you, which made me realize you live here now. You bought the Hansville Café, right? Quick call to one of my sources and I learned you might be a consultant on this case.”
“I’m not.”
“Then why are you here?”
“Who’s your source?”
She laughed. “Twenty years in the NYPD and you still don’t know how the press works?”
He stepped closer, his eyes hard. “You said you looked into me, right?”
She nodded.
“Did you read what the tabloids wrote after I was shot, after my wife was killed?”
She nodded. “I was sorry to read about it. Really. Sounds like you went through hell. But please don’t tell me you’re one of those cops who blames the reporters.”
“I’m not a cop.” Austin took a deep breath, trying to cool himself down. “And I don’t blame reporters for unloading a nine-millimeter into my shoulder, my ribs, my forearm and my thigh.” He swallowed hard. “And I don’t blame reporters for the bullet that killed my wife. You know what I blame them for? For headline after headline that questioned why I took four bullets and lived while she took one and died. For headline after headline that questioned whether she was killed because of a case I was working on. I blame them for the story that wondered in print whether I’d had her killed because she was having an affair, which she wasn’t—taking four bullets strategically placed to leave me alive—as cover up. I blame them for…” He trailed off, letting out a long, slow breath. “I blame the bastards who fired the guns. You folks in the press made it a little worse. A sprinkling of bitterness on an unending nightmare.”
Anna Downey looked at the ground. “I’m sorry. And that’s poetic, but I still have to do my job. I don’t work for the New York tabloids and I don’t write BS.” She looked up. “Assuming you’re here to help on this case…” she slid a business card into the pocket of his jeans… “don’t hesitate to call. Day or night. I grew up here. Know the area, know everyone here.” She chuckled. “Half the cops in the county are my uncle.”
“Thanks, but you won’t be hearing from me. Trust me on that.”
He turned and pushed open the door.
“Austin,” she called after him. “I’m sorry about what went down with your wife. I really am. And I think I understand why you do what you do, or why you did what you did before you quit. I live here. I care about this place. My reporting has tipped detectives inside that building onto two murder suspects and brought home a kid who’d been kidnapped by his biological father. I give a shit. And I don’t do things the way the New York tabloids do. But I have to ask you: was a little bad press enough to get you to quit, to walk away from a job that, by all accounts, you were damn good at?”
He thought for a moment, considered shutting the door in her face and walking away. But something made him want to answer. She had an earnestness about her that he’d never seen from a reporter in New York, most of whom were from someplace else, or working like hell to get someplace else. “For a long time my wife and I thought we could save the world. Or at least, save a city. Or at least save enough people in a city that it would feel like we’d done something. I quit because I decided the world can’t be saved. Or maybe it’s not worth saving.”
Her look was neutral, her bright blue eyes scanning his face like she was searching for the truth in what he said. “And yet,” she said, shoving her cellphone in the back pocket of her jeans, “here you are.”
She walked back to her car as he eased through the door.
