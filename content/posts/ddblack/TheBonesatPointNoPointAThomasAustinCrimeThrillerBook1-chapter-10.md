Chapter 9
CHAPTER NINE
The conference room at the end of the hall looked like a crummy breakout room at a 2-star conference center. A folding table and six chairs atop a thinning, patternless carpet. A coffee maker perched on a black mini-fridge next to a sink in the corner. A whiteboard clinging crookedly to a wall that had more pin pricks than a voodoo doll. That was it. Austin didn’t know if the room smelled like stale instant ramen, or if the taste in his mouth made him think so.
Detective Ridley Calvin stood in front of the whiteboard, already covered with notes about the case. Next to him, Lucy O’Rourke was taping a Kitsap County map to a wall as Jimmy sat on a plastic chair, staring at his phone.
On the wall to his left, there was a large sketch of a generic-looking woman in her fifties or sixties with dirty blonde hair. Austin assumed that was the woman who’d been spotted leaving the bones on the beach. It was one of the worst sketches he’d ever seen, likely a combination of a bad artist and unreliable witnesses. Next to the sketch were two photos of tiny babies, one labeled “Joshua Green” and the other “Allie Shreever, deceased.”
On the top left of the whiteboard, Ridley had written “Allie Shreever—Bremerton.” On the right side, he was adding a new name: “Joshua Green—Bainbridge Island.” Below the name of the first victim were a couple dates—likely the abduction date, the suspected date of death, and the date the bones had been found, along with a half dozen names he didn’t recognize. Family members, witnesses, and suspects, most likely. Under the second name was a big white space.
He knew that blank space well. It meant that they had nothing.
Austin cleared his throat. Jimmy looked up briefly, then back down at his phone. Ridley and Lucy turned.
“Take a seat,” Ridley said. “And thanks for coming.”
Ridley added the names of the parents of the latest victim to the white board—Deidre Gailhammer and Damian Green—then leaned against the wall. “Jimmy, off the phone, let’s go, what do you have?”
Lucy sat next to Jimmy, kicking his boot as she sat. “Off the phone, dumbass.”
He set the phone on his lap. “You should talk, Lucy O’Please-Like-My-Instagram-Post. You’re on your phone way more than me. And anyway, I wasn’t scrolling. We got the first surveillance footage from Hansville.”
“That’s good news,” Ridley said, “but hold on. Let me say first, to make it official: this is Thomas Austin, retired NYPD detective. He’s gonna help us out on this. Lucy, he’ll be accompanying you. Knows the D’Antonia case inside and out. His insight will no doubt be valuable. Copycats are often obsessed with the original, try to mimic every detail. Thomas, you’ll have to sign some stuff on the way out the door. I don’t know what, just, well, sign it. Something about liability and not putting yourself in harm’s way.”
Austin nodded. “Got it. And please, call me Austin.”
“Right. Will do.” He waved a hand toward Jimmy. “This is Jimmy Jule, aka ‘Not-JJ.’ Only man I know who can bench press four times his IQ.”
Austin laughed. “That supposed to be a compliment?”
Jimmy said, “I take it as one. And yeah, don’t call me JJ.” He looked to be in his late-twenties, with skin tanned so evenly it had to be artificial, especially in December. His short brown hair had been gelled into place and he had a tattoo of an eagle on his muscular forearm.
“Why not?” Austin asked.
“He doesn’t like to talk about it,” Lucy said. “Under all those muscles he’s a sensitive flower of a man.”
Jimmy’s face reddened. “Look, I had a cat named JJ. It didn’t end well.”
Lucy tossed a crumpled piece of paper at his head. “Tell him what the ‘JJ’ stood for.”
“Justice Jellybean.” He tossed the paper back at her, but she dodged, allowing it to sail past her head. “What do you want? I was five and those were the two things I loved. Anyway, thanks for pitching in, Austin. Why do you go by your last name?”
“As a kid I was really into reruns of The Six Million Dollar Man. Told my parents I wanted to go by ‘Austin.’ They kept calling me ‘Tommy,’ but in college my roommate was into wrestling and thought Stone Cold Steve Austin was the coolest dude ever. So he started calling me Austin, and from there we just ran with it.”
“You do look kind of like Lee Majors,” Ridley said.
Lucy and Jimmy were staring blankly. Austin said, “You have no idea who we’re talking about, do you?”
Jimmy shook his head. “Friend of yours?”
Lucy threw another ball of paper at his head.
Ridley began pacing. “I just got back from the home of the victims on Bainbridge. The mom, Deirdre, was frantic. Could barely get anything out of her. Her mother arrived from the other side of the island and is trying to calm her down. The husband was out of town and will be back soon.”
“Out of town?” Lucy asked. “We sure about that?”
“I’ll be interviewing him myself,” Ridley said. “Already looking into his alibi.”
Ridley knew as well as Austin that most kidnappings were committed by someone who knew the victim. Fathers taking kids in the midst of a custody battle, that sort of thing. This didn’t appear to be one of those times, but they had to look into everything.
“As of this moment,” Ridley said, “we are treating the Green kidnapping as directly connected to the kidnapping and murder of Allie Shreever. Other than the similarity in the abductions, we don’t have any direct evidence they are connected, but my gut says they are.”
“Mine, too,” Jimmy added.
“Your gut probably just wants another protein shake,” Lucy said.
Jimmy flexed a perfectly-tanned bicep. “Gotta feed the guns, Lucy O’Lemon Drop Shots.”
“So,” Austin said, “I assume we work both avenues: the fresh case, Joshua Green, and the older one, Allie Shreever.”
Ridley nodded. “Directly following this meeting, the three of us will head out to Bainbridge to interview the Greens.” He pointed at Jimmy. “You stay here and go through that surveillance footage like you’re getting paid a million bucks per lead.”
“Am I getting a million bucks per lead?” Jimmy asked.
Ridley ignored him.
Austin flashed back to the news report. “The Green house looked fancy, modern. Security cameras?”
“Nope,” Jimmy said. “They’re, I don’t know how to say it, kinda hippy-ish was the vibe I got. Dad runs some big organic juice thing in Seattle. I asked the mom about it and she said something about ‘the surveillance state.’ House smelled funny—incense and kombucha.”
“We’ll double check on surveillance footage,” Ridley added, “but Jimmy is right, as far as we know. I’m sure we’ll get footage from another house on the block, or from a traffic light nearby, but that could take a few days, and we may not have that long.” He paced for a moment, then continued. “Lucy, take Austin back to the beginning of the Shreever case. Fill him in on what we have.” He glanced at Austin, apologetically. “It isn’t much. Parents, suspects we’ve looked at. And the witnesses. Go talk to Benny and Sarah again. Maybe Austin can get something new out of them.”
Lucy nodded. “Already called them. After we talk to the Green and Gailhammer family, Benny and Sarah are our first stop.”
Ridley turned to Jimmy, who was back on his phone. “Bicep man, what do you have on surveillance?”
Jimmy walked over to the whiteboard. “I’ll get to that, but first, I’ve got every digital file that’s available on the D’Antonia case. I’ll be going over them later, but in the meantime I have an AI running through them looking for anomalies.”
“Wait,” Austin said, “What?” Yesterday, Ridley had introduced Jimmy as a deputy and also their resident “tech guy.” Austin assumed that meant he could restart the Wi-Fi or get the TV to work. Looks could be deceiving, but Austin thought he looked like a bit of a meathead. Austin’s mentor had told him once that there were two kinds of cops, thinkers and door-bashers. That was, of course, an oversimplification, but Jimmy looked like a door-basher if anyone did.
Jimmy said, “It rarely gets us anything, but it’s low-hanging fruit. Any files that are readable digitally, I run a series of algorithms on them to look for patterns. Words mentioned again and again, names mentioned once and never followed up on.” Apparently he could see the skepticism on Austin’s face. “I know, I know. This isn’t Minority Report. We’re not actually basing anything on this. It’s one more arrow in our quiver. Occasionally it spits out something we missed. It’s really Samantha’s thing. Intern. You’ll meet her later, I’m sure.”
Austin nodded. “What were you saying about the surveillance videos? That’s more my thing.”
“The bones of Allie Shreever were found three weeks ago now. There’s no footage from the beach, of course, but we’ve knocked on every door, watched hours of useless footage from people’s home security cameras, hoping to get a suspect, an unusual car passing, something.”
Austin’s door had been one of the ones knocked on. When the bones had been found, an officer had come into his café and questioned him, Andy, and a few patrons, who were happy to share details about everything they’d ever seen, though none of it had seemed useful. The officers had, of course, not mentioned that the bones were found in a holiday gift bag.
“Finally got a hit,” Jimmy said. “Driveway cam pointing toward a mailbox on Hansville Highway. Owners were out of town the last couple weeks, but they have some footage from that morning. It’s not great, but it has cars coming and going toward that beach on the morning in question.”
“Hot damn!” Lucy said. “Lucy O’Likes-That.”
Jimmy stood and performed a gesture halfway between a bow and sneezing into the crook of his elbow.
Austin was pretty sure the kids called it ‘dabbing.’ He glanced at Ridley and waved a hand toward Lucy and Jimmy. “This normal?”
Ridley shook his head. “Sadly, yes.” Then, to Jimmy, he asked, “How soon can you have more?”
“I’ll watch the footage as soon as we’re done.”
Ridley nodded and took a long swig out of a giant silver coffee cup. “One more thing. I’m fighting to keep Sheriff Daniels off our ass, but we have to deliver, and fast. We’re treating this case as though we have three days—two and a half now—before Joshua Green shows up in a bag. We cannot allow that to happen. Sheriff already got a call from the FBI. He told me that, for now, they are kindly offering assistance. Profiling. More advanced forensics than we can manage. He stressed the for now part of that. He told them about the bones, the similarities to the D’Antonia case. They’re not taking over yet, but they can and will if the mood hits them. And if it leaks in the press that Allie Shreever’s bones were found in the bag…” he grimaced, as though the thought alone pained him… “if that leaks, national media will descend and the FBI will have no choice but to follow. That happens and I’ll be grabbing lattes for buzzcut FBI assholes half my age. Lucy and Jimmy, you don’t even want to think about where that will leave you in the pecking order. It may involve shining wingtips.”
Austin raised a finger. “Might have a problem there. Ran into a reporter, or blogger, or, well, I don’t know what she was but—”
Ridley smiled. “Anna?”
“Yeah, that’s her.”
“Pain in the ass, but she’s a friend. Not a friend, but, well, I hate her a lot less than I hate most reporters.”
“Fine,” Austin said, “but she has the bones. The Thanksgiving bag. Said she wasn’t gonna run it yet.”
Austin could make out the lines on Ridley’s temples as they flared. “She what?” He looked from Jimmy to Lucy. He could go from relaxed to enraged in a heartbeat, and he just had.
Jimmy stood up. “That’s probably on me. I’m sorry. I was on my cellphone and she heard me mention the witnesses—Benny and Sarah. She knows everyone. Likely tracked them down and got it from them.”
“Jimmy O’Jackass,” Lucy said, swinging a fist at his shoulder but missing as he leapt back. “Stay the hell off your phone.”
“I know.” He looked at the floor. “She was lurking in the parking lot.”
Ridley walked a slow lap around the folding table. “Why wouldn’t she have run it yet?”
“Called me for comment,” Jimmy said. “I convinced her to hold it for a day or two in exchange for an exclusive interview with whoever catches the bastard behind this.”
Ridley frowned. “We solve crimes as a team, Jimmy. And we do not take victory laps in the press.”
He looked at the floor, shamefaced. “I screwed up.”
Ridley let out a puff of air like a kettle releasing steam. “I’ll call her and try to convince her to do the right thing.” He turned to Lucy. “You and Austin get going. I’ll be right behind you. We talk to the recent victims, then you two head out to see Benny and Sarah. I’m hoping his fresh eyes will bring something new to this thing.”
