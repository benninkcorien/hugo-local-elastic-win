Chapter 41
CHAPTER FORTY-ONE
The volunteer search parties had gone home for the evening and the parking lot around his building was strangely empty. Run was sleeping in her doggie bed in the corner and Andy was just closing up the store when Austin arrived, slowing from his sprint and panting. “Landline… Call… Detective Calvin… Lucy. Anyone. I think… Bonner is here.” He pointed at the wall next to the supply room, on the other side of which was his apartment. “In my house. I’m… gonna go check it out.”
“Shouldn’t you wait for—”
He was already out the door.
He crept around the side of the building, eyes on the living room windows. No lights were on. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary except for the sinking feeling in his gut. The wind had gone still, giving the evening a motionless, eerie quality. He smelled saltwater and heard the faint crashes of waves on the beach.
He stopped at the fence. He couldn’t hear anything inside. He wouldn’t open it. Not yet.
Instead, he crept around the building, moving slowly. Above the sink in the kitchen was a small window, visible from the west side of the building. Not a window, actually, but a section of old, metalized glass blocks, the kind that were designed to let in light while retaining some privacy from the outside world. No light through the glass blocks.
Maybe he’d been wrong. Paranoid. The only room that didn’t have a window was the bedroom, so unless she was operating in darkness or had stashed everyone in the bedroom, Mary Bonner wasn’t there.
Then he saw something. The glass blocks looked different. In addition to being wavy and opaque, they were damp, steamy from the inside. He’d seen that once before. When he’d boiled water for ravioli.
His first thought was to race through the front door. But that would take him right into the kitchen. Joshua Green weighed no more than ten pounds. If she still had the knife she’d used on Jimmy, a simple flick of the wrist could end him.
He hurried back to the store, shushed Andy as he walked through, and quietly entered the café’s storage room, where the crawl space led into the apartment, into his bedroom.
Holding his breath, he crawled on his hands and knees, careful not to bump the sides in the narrow space. His eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness.
He reached the hatch, a piece of plywood that had been stuck up unceremoniously when the apartment had been added to the building in the nineties. He could easily push it in, but he needed to stay quiet.
Prying the wood with his fingers, he carefully lifted the hatch and peered into his bedroom. The lights were off. He saw nothing.
Then he heard something. A muffled groan.
He let out a quiet breath as he placed the hatch cover on the carpet.
He looked to his left, where Anna Downey was tied up in the corner.
Still crouched, he duck-walked next to her, eyes on the door that led to the living room and kitchen. “Is she still here?” he whispered.
She pointed toward the kitchen.
Then suddenly he heard the gentle singing voice of Mary Bonner. He could not make out the words.
He took off the gag, a red bandana tied around her head and covering her mouth. He untied her feet. “Crawl through that space. It leads to the restaurant. Do not look back or try to help. Detectives will be here soon.” He finished untying her hands, and met her look of defiance with one of his own. She wanted to stay, wanted to help, but she understood.
He waited until she was gone before inching toward the gun safe under his bed. Eyes still on the door, he tapped in the code and pulled out his MR1911. He’d hoped to never again use it outside a range, but he kept it loaded.
Quietly, he walked to the door and stepped into the dark living room. The only light came from the two burners that blazed on high in the kitchen. On top of them, his pasta pot steamed away.
Oh, God. He was too late.
Mary Bonner began singing again, and this time he could make out the words.
Christmas is
A time for joy
Let’s gather together
Every girl and boy
Stockings and cookies
And presents for all
Bring good cheer and wonder
As winter does call
Her voice was a deep, throaty whisper, full of pain.
Then he heard the best sound he’d ever heard in his life. The gentle coo of a tiny baby. He peered around the doorway into the darkened kitchen. Mary Bonner stood next to the stove, cradling little Joshua Green in her arms, singing to him.
Christmas is
A time for joy
He raised his .45 and stepped into the doorway.
Let’s gather together
Every girl and boy
“Mary Bonner.” He aimed at her head. “Do. Not. Move.”
