Chapter 15
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
An hour later, Austin sat on the curb outside the apartment building as a paramedic bandaged up a gash just above his right hip. “Gonna be a helluva bruise,” she said. “But you’ll be fine.”
He flinched as she secured the bandage with adhesive tape.
When she’d finished, she patted him on the back. “The cut isn't too deep. You were lucky it was a scooter and not a car.”
Austin nodded. “Thanks. I make sure to dodge vehicles over a quarter ton.”
The paramedic frowned. Apparently she didn’t approve of joking about getting hit by cars, but humor was the best way to distract himself from the rhythmic pulses of pain shooting from his hip down his leg.
“Sorry,” he said. “Bad joke. Thanks.”
She frowned again and returned to the ambulance.
He pulled out Trisha Simone’s cellphone and the screen lit up with notifications she’d received. The first was a text from a woman named Mary:
How’s Itsy doing? Give her kisses for me.
A notification from a local bank:
Low balance alert, account 111450892: $36.55 remaining.
As he held it, it vibrated in his hand:
TaskRabbit Notification: New Task Available in Seattle. $60.
He’d never heard of TaskRabbit, but it was something to look into when they returned to the office.
Lucy pulled into the lot. Austin looked up expectantly as she parked and got out, but she was already shaking her head. “She’s in the wind.”
“Damn.” Just after he’d found the cellphone, she and the two officers who’d been on the doors had arrived. They’d fanned out around the park, but it was huge, eight-hundred acres of trails, logging roads, and dense forest. Austin had thought they’d find her. He was glad he’d gotten her phone, but embarrassed he’d been outrun. He told himself he needed to start jogging again the minute he was through with this case.
Lucy stood over him. “We’ve got three officers looking for her, but Sherlock is back with the warrant. We’re gonna toss the place.”
“How long will it take to get into this?” He held up the cellphone.
“Holy shit! Is that?” She nabbed the phone. “It’ll take longer to get a warrant for this. And Apple is, well, their cooperation is hit or miss. Samantha can get us in, but it’ll take a minute.”
“A minute? I thought it would take a few days.”
“It’s an expression. You really don’t get out much, do you?”
He ignored this. “Can I come up to—”
“No.”
“You’ll fill me in?” He held up his shirt, revealing the bandage. “I’ve got blood in the game now.”
She smiled. “Every detail. And good work on this. You hadn’t been there, she’d have taken her truck and disappeared.”
* * *
Lucy was first into the apartment. The door opened into a small kitchen, which led to a living room that held a couch, a small table, and a treadmill too big for the space. Through the living room were a grimy bathroom and bedroom. The place was a mess, cluttered with too much stuff for the six-hundred square foot space and in need of a deep cleaning.
The dog was one of the tiniest—and cutest, and loudest—Lucy had ever seen. She had a cast on her left front leg, which was about the size of the leg of a Barbie Doll. She was a shivering little mound backed into the corner of the kitchen and her bark had gone from an “arf, arf, arf” sound to a more shrill, “oww, oww, oww” as though its leg were being broken all over again. Lucy picked up the dog and it stopped barking immediately and began licking any part of her it could reach. A loving but desperate gesture. Judging by the collar, her name was Itsy-Bitsy.
Photos of the tiny thing graced the fridge, the bathroom, and the bedroom. Framed, unframed, dressed up and natural, it seemed as though their suspect cared more for this dog than she did for anything else in the world. A pile of bills on the couch were marked in red with Final Notice warnings, and there was a half completed payment plan application for a veterinary bill on the couch indicating that she owed $6,000 for the surgery on Itsy-Bitsy’s leg.
Tucked under the blankets on the bed, Lucy found a silver laptop. Combined with the phone, they now had access to Trisha Simone’s entire digital life. Unless she was smart about digital forensics—which very few people of her age were—they’d be able to recreate much of her life. Lucy carefully packed it in an evidence bag and asked Ridley to start on the warrants.
They found multiple pairs of size-eight shoes and, after five minutes, Ridley came back from the bedroom holding up a single running shoe in his gloved hand. “Adidas, size 8.”
“Boom!” It was the same size and brand found imprinted on the carpet in Joshua Green’s nursery. A hell of a find, but Lucy couldn’t escape a nagging thought. “I wonder: can you see anyone who cares for their dog this much killing a tiny baby? Boiling it and writing a poem on its bones?”
Ridley placed the shoe in an evidence bag. “Some serial killers show early tendencies by harming animals. Others love animals. Their murders come from a different place entirely. Some of the worst killers are sickeningly sentimental about certain things.” He labeled the bag and added it to the crate of evidence they would take from the apartment. “Buddy of mine in eastern Washington arrested a serial rapist who ran one of the best petting zoos in the state. By all accounts, he treated animals like kings by day and treated women like his property by night. He’s doing life right now. Became a vegan in prison.” He shook his head. “There’s just no telling.”
Lucy considered this. “Maybe, but…”
“Lucy!” Officer Johnson, whom she’d stationed by the front door earlier, stood next to the couch. Lucy turned to see him holding up a gallon-sized bag packed full of marijuana. “Intent to distribute?”
“Bingo,” she said. “No evidence of any babies here, but this is enough to bring her in and hold her.” She turned to Ridley. “Boss, you think she keeps the kid somewhere else?”
“The dog’s water bowl is mostly full. So she’s been here in the last day or two.”
“Neighbor I spoke with across the hall said he thought she was here yesterday.”
“Hmm.” Ridley ran a hand over his bald head. “We’ve got enough to hold her, assuming we locate her. But…”
“What?” Lucy asked when he trailed off.
“I don’t know. She looks kinda like The Baby Butcher. We know she’s likely the one who left the bones on the beach. But why would you keep coming back to your apartment when you have a baby stashed somewhere else?”
Lucy pointed at a framed photo of Itsy-Bitsy, lapping at a Starbucks cup full of whipped cream. “They call it a puppachino. She loves this dog past the point of reason.”
Ridley frowned. “Okay, then why not bring the dog with her?”
Lucy shrugged. “Could be a lot of reasons, but boss, this is a good day. We have our woman. Truck, eyewitnesses, fleeing from cops, a bag of weed the size of a ferryboat. She’s our woman. And our guys are gonna find her out there. I’m just waiting for my phone to buzz with the good news.”
* * *
Austin was growing impatient. He was fully invested in this case, and he wanted to be inside, executing the warrant. Across the driveway, another team was inspecting the truck, dusting for prints, and itemizing the various pieces of trash found therein.
“Run Forest, Run.” He recognized the woman’s voice behind him. Turning, he saw Anna Downey.
“You stalking me?” he asked.
“Don’t tell me you don’t get that reference either?”
“Even I saw that movie,” Austin said. “Shouldn’t you be out snooping through people’s trash or brainstorming salacious headlines?”
She laughed.
“Wait,” Austin said. “How’d you know I was running? And who tipped you off to—”
“You literally ran past my house.” She pointed down the block. “Little white dump with a busted picket fence. Like Dorothy’s house after the tornado hit.”
Austin shrugged. That one he didn’t get.
Anna feigned a gasp, took off her sunglasses, and sat next to him. She put on an exaggerated reporter voice. “Mr. Austin, Anna Downey here, Kingston News at Five. The people need to know, did you have a childhood? Or did you come into the world as a jaded forty-something detective?”
He smiled. “The latter.”
In her normal voice, she added, “It’s from Wizard of Oz.”
He knew a good portion of his generation spoke in movie and TV references, but Anna was taking it to a new level. “Oh, yeah. I remember that witch terrified me when I was a kid. I must have blocked it out.”
“Thank goodness.” She swiped her hand across her forehead. “I was beginning to think you were born before television and books were invented.”
He chuckled. “Clever. And listen, before you ask, I can’t comment on what went down here.”
“No worries, I already got it from someone else.” She stretched her legs out in front of her.
Austin couldn’t help but notice she had Adidas running shoes on. “What size do you wear?”
“Nine and a half. Why?”
He leaned back. She was tall, and her feet were definitely on the larger side. “Old habits die hard. Can’t turn it off.”
She pulled a thin notebook out of her pocket. “Are you saying one of your suspects has this kind of shoe?”
His lips formed a tight line.
“Then lemme ask something else,” Anna said. “You were chasing that woman pretty damn fast for a guy who doesn’t think the world can be saved.”
Austin frowned. “That wasn’t a question.”
“More of an observation. Care to comment?” She tilted her head to the side, her look softening. “Not for a story. Just curious.”
“Like I said, old habits die hard.”
She considered this, then cocked her head to the other side as though flipping a switch. “I’m here to talk to Ridley, but I’ll ask you first. Any thoughts on the fact that Joshua Green and Allie Shreever were born at the same hospital? As far as I can tell, it’s the only connection between the two. And there’s something else. Two nurses in the birthing center there haven’t shown up for their regular shifts this week.”
Ridley hadn’t yet filled him in on what he’d learned at the hospital, but he had to assume that, if Anna knew this, so did he. “Could be a lot of reasons for that.”
“Sure, but it’s interesting.”
“I’m sure Detective Calvin will tell you everything he cares to tell you.”
She smirked. “Well, you’re no fun, are you?”
She stood and handed him a business card.
Austin stuffed it in his pocket. “You already gave me one of these.”
“I know. I assume you tossed it.”
“I didn’t.”
She headed toward the apartment building, turning just long enough to call, “Then there’s hope for us yet.”
