Chapter 37
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
As he read the article, Austin felt the walls of the hospital closing in around him.
Johnson Hill Orphanage Settles Case of Illegal Placements from 1970s
Only four days before the trial was set to begin, Johnson Hill Orphanage of Seattle settled a decades-old dispute with a group of plaintiffs who claimed the organization misled them in the 1970s. The case stemmed from three dozen placements of twins, and four placements of triplets, all occurring between 1971 and 1974.
According to court filings, the plaintiffs—who sought over $40 million in damages—alleged that the orphanage misled them when servicing their adoptions. Specifically, they were never told that the children they were adopting were parts of twin or triplet sets.
When revelations of separated twins and triplets began to emerge in the early-2000s, according to court filings, Johnson Hill claimed that it was difficult to place twins and triplets, which was the reason for the separation.
However, files discovered only recently show that, in fact, the twins and triplets had been intentionally separated in a controversial study conducted by psychiatrists Sandra D. Conrad and Mark Voohrees.
The study involved placing the separated twins and triplets with families having different parenting styles and levels of wealth and status. While one twin would be placed, for example, in an upper-class family, the other would be placed in a lower-class family. In one case, triplets were placed with three different families who had indicated wildly-varied parenting styles on their applications, ranging from “strict military disciplinarians” to “laissez-faire hippies,” according to the unpublished study. And while the adoptive parents agreed to have their children studied, the full extent of the experiment was never explained to them, according to the lawsuit.
Byron Moskovitz, a researcher in clinical psychology at the University of Washington, believes the experiment—while perhaps not illegal in the 1970s—was a wild departure from the norms, and an egregious breach of trust. “In essence,” Moskovitz said, “this was a nature versus nurture experiment on unwilling human subjects.”
The plaintiffs, who sued in civil court, claim that Johnson Hill destroyed and falsified records for years to cover up the shared parentage of the separated twins and triplets. The true intent of the study—which was never published—only came to light recently when children of psychiatrist Mark Voohrees donated his papers to his alma mater upon his death.
The amount of the settlement has not yet been disclosed.
Austin stared at the article for a long time, his eyes soft and unfocused, turning the paper into a black and white blur. His mouth had gone dry as he read the article. The room had closed in around him. He couldn’t believe it, and yet it explained so much.
Mary Bonner was Lorraine D’Antonia’s twin sister.
His phone vibrated in his pocket. In a daze, he pulled it out.
“How’s Jimmy?” Ridley’s voice brought him back to himself.
“Couldn’t see him.” His words sounded strange, like he was observing himself from outside his body. The implications of the article were too big to take in all at once. “Five hours of surgery. Daniels was here. Sounds like Jimmy will make it.”
“Good, that’s good. If he hadn’t made it…”
“I know. I… I screwed up.”
“I know you had a run-in with Daniels, but he’s just looking for someone to blame. This isn’t on you.”
“I appreciate that, but in some ways this is on me. Has anyone talked with the slip owners? Any boats missing? Or is it possible she had her own boat?”
“We checked the slip registrations,” Ridley said. “Nothing in Mary Bonner’s name, or in the Houghton name, the owners of the cabin. A boat is missing, though. We’ve got people looking for it.”
He was going to tell Ridley about the article when he heard a commotion in the background of the call. It sounded like people were shouting, but more in excitement than in anger.
Ridley’s voice came from faraway, like the phone had dropped from his face. “Right. Where? I’ll be right there. No one touches anything.” Then his normal voice was back. “Austin, we found the car.”
“You did?” Austin perked up immediately. It was the first good news of the day.
But Ridley did not sound pleased. “At the boat launch next to Point No Point.”
“So why do you sound like this is bad news?”
Ridley paused, and Austin could almost see him running a hand over his bald head. “Because it’s six feet underwater.”
