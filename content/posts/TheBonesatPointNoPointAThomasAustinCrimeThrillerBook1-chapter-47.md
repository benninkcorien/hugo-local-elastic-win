Chapter 46
CHAPTER FORTY-SIX
An hour later, Joshua Green’s parents leapt out of their car and ran across the parking lot. His mother Deidre took him in her arms and dropped to the ground, cradling him and inspecting him at the same time.
Paramedics had finished their initial examination of the baby and found him bruised in a few spots, clearly in some kind of shock, but nourished and hydrated. Miraculously, he seemed to have no permanent physical damage. From here, his parents would accompany him to the hospital, but it appeared as though he’d be okay. His cries had lost the hysterical pain, but there would be a lot of healing to do.
After crouching with Joshua and his wife for a few minutes, Damian Green, Joshua’s father, walked over to Austin. “She’s really dead?”
Austin nodded grimly. Mary Bonner had been found on the beach, head caved in by a large rock, a spear of driftwood through her chest. “I’m sorry. I tried to bring her in alive. People who haven’t been through it don’t know why it matters. I know.”
Austin had thought about it a hundred times. Of course there was part of him that wanted the men who’d killed Fiona to suffer the same fate. But not by their own hands. He’d rather see them face the humiliation of arrest, a public trial, and spend the rest of their miserable lives in prison.
Damian nodded. “I have to thank you.”
Austin held up both hands. “It’s alright. Go be with your family.”
“No, really. I looked you up. Your wife.” He grimaced and looked at the ground. “I felt so powerless the last few days. I just read everything I could about you, about the other detectives, about Lorraine D’Antonia. Just obsessed and obsessed. Couldn’t keep myself off the internet.” He shook his head. “You know what it’s like losing someone. I knew what it was like for three days. Now…” he gestured to his wife and to Joshua, who were getting into the back of the ambulance. “Now I don’t have to anymore.”
“You should be thanking her.” He pointed to Anna’s white SUV, which the tow truck hauled to the parking lot next to the lighthouse. He doubted the thing would run anymore, but Anna sat on the hood, typing up a story on her phone.
“I will,” he said. “And I’ll apologize to the other detectives. I was…”
“Out of your mind?”
Damian nodded. “I was pissed I’d been caught. I was stupid and angry.”
Austin shoved his hands in his pockets. “I’m no relationship expert. But I’m pretty decent at reading people. Just a skill I developed.” Austin paused.
“And?”
“Sometimes tragedies destroy relationships, sometimes they bring people back together.” He nodded toward Deirdre, who held Joshua tight in the flashing lights of the ambulance. “Maybe your wife gives you a second chance now. If she does, don’t blow it.”
“I won’t, I—”
“No, listen.” Austin waited until Damian Green looked into his eyes. “I used to have it as good as you have it right now. Not a child. We were going to try. But a wife. A wife who…” He dropped his eyes to the ground, tears forming in his eyes. “I thought I appreciated what I had, but I didn’t. Use this horror to take stock of your life. If she gives you another chance, do anything you can, move heaven and earth to make it work.”

It was past midnight by the time Austin sat down next to Detectives O’Rourke and Ridley on the beach, balancing three paper cups carefully. He handed each of them a coffee. “On the house,” he said. “Andy is making sandwiches and coffee for everyone who’s working.”
Joshua’s parents had left for the hospital, Anna had filed her story from her phone, completed the first round of statements about the case, and gotten a ride home. She’d deal with her car later.
Lucy toasted him. “Merry Christmas Eve.”
Ridley glanced at his watch. “Technically, it’s Christmas morning already.”
“When do you want my official statement?” Austin asked.
Ridley sighed. “It can wait until tomorrow.”
Austin was glad to hear that. He hadn’t felt this tired in years.
“How are you holding up?” Lucy asked, pointing at his shoulder. The paramedics had bandaged him up, but he’d refused to leave the scene until everything was settled.
“I’m heading to the hospital after this. Probably a few stitches, but it didn’t go too deep.” He took a long, slow sip of the coffee and stared at the blackness of the Puget Sound. “What’s this going to mean? Lorraine? Mary?”
Ridley let out a long, tired sigh. “It’s not good. D’Antonia’s lawyers will use what happened to try to get her out of prison, whether or not they hear about what Bonner told you. We’ve got forensics in your apartment, dusting for fingerprints and looking for other evidence. We’re in the cabin, in her apartment. My guess is we’re going to find evidence that what she told you is true. That she killed the babies in Seattle and let her sister take the rap.”
“But if D’Antonia did the New York murder?”
“It’s complicated. Maybe her confession gets thrown out and she’s released, but she’s still set to stand trial in New York, so—”
Austin considered this. “I know people in New York. Prosecutors. I can help smooth the path if she’s got to stand trial there.”
“That would be good,” Ridley said.
They all stared out at the water for a long time, then Austin said, “Fiona and I used to argue about nature versus nurture. You know, what made a criminal a criminal. Whether people were born evil and all that.”
Lucy turned toward him. “Must be messing with your brain that Mary Bonner committed most of the murders.”
Austin shook his head slowly and rubbed his hands together, trying to get warm. He’d thought that Lorraine D’Antonia was an example of nature being more important than nurture when he knew her as the child adopted into stability. But the fact that the vilest evil had been in Mary Bonner, who’d had one of the worst upbringings imaginable, had him rethinking everything. “I don’t know. Reminds me of something Fiona’s brother told me once. He was an alcoholic. Recovered now, but he was trying to explain why he drank. In his mind, it wasn’t exactly a disease he was born with, but it wasn’t not that, either. He shared a quote with me from this physician who studied addiction. The point was, in the real world, the nature versus nurture argument is nonsense. Our lives are complex in a hundred ways we can see and a thousand we can’t. Millions of moment-by-moment interactions between genetic and environmental factors. These interactions work together to create our minds, bodies, and our actions. To create the world. He was talking specifically about addiction, about whether people become alcoholics because of their genes or because of the circumstances of their lives. Maybe the same holds true for evil. Maybe we’re not born evil, and maybe we don’t become evil because of what happens to us. Maybe evil is something in between that we’ll never fully understand.”
“That sounds about right,” Ridley said quietly.
“We may never be able to fully understand it,” Lucy added. “But sometimes we can stop it.”
That sounded about right, too.
