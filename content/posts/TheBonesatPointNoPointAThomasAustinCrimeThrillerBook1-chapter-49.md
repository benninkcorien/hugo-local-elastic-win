Chapter 48
CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT
Two weeks later, Austin was in his yard with Run when Anna’s white SUV pulled up. It was a rare sunny day in January, the air cold and crisp. He’d spent the morning with Andy, training a new cook and testing out some pancake recipes on the regulars. Mr. and Mrs. McGuilicutty had agreed with everyone else: the bananas foster pancakes were the clear winner and should be added to the menu.
Anna made eye contact from across the parking lot, and she appeared to be holding a package.
He hadn’t seen her since the night everything came to a head with Mary Bonner. They’d texted a few times, but Anna had been busy. Her first-hand report on the night Joshua Green was saved had gone viral across the country. She’d been interviewed on morning shows, true crime shows, and a dozen different podcasts and blogs.
Austin was pleasantly surprised to see her and offered a warm smile as she approached. He couldn’t remember another time he’d been happy to see a reporter strolling toward him. “You got your car back.”
“Who knew you could sink a car in the Sound and it would be back up and running in two weeks?” She leaned on the railing. “Mechanic here in town is a miracle worker.” She handed him a small box wrapped in brown paper and tied with white ribbon. “I never had a chance to give you your Christmas present. Well, to be honest, I had it made last week. I didn’t actually plan to give you a Christmas present.”
“I hope it’s a coffee pot.”
“What?”
“Mine was broken but usable. Now it’s ruined.” He’d been drinking coffee from the café for the last two weeks because he hadn’t yet gotten around to buying a new one.
Run dropped the ball on Austin’s foot, gave a soft pleading growl, then picked it up and dropped it again. It was her way of getting his attention when he stopped playing for more than a few seconds.
“Do you want to walk?” Austin asked, picking up the ball. “She needs a bigger space to roam.”
Anna nodded and they walked down to the beach, where the water was still, the sun glittering off the calm water like a million sapphires.
He tossed the ball as far as he could, watching Run take off at a sprint.
“Are you gonna open it?” Anna asked.
Austin stopped and opened the box. Inside was a wooden plaque, the same shape as Fiona’s. The bright sun reflected off the silver plate stamped into it. Etched into the plate were five words.
The World is Worth Saving.
He read the inscription twice, then looked out to the water, across the Sound. In New York, even on the clearest days, the views were nothing like here. To the northeast, the snowy peaks of the north cascades glistened against a clear blue sky.
“Thank you,” he said quietly.
Anna said, “I thought you needed another one.”
“How’d you know I kept Fiona’s after she died?”
“A hunch. I read about her plaque in a profile about her.”
“A hunch? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with how much you know about me.” He paused. “I never got a chance to tell you, if you hadn’t texted me, Jimmy would have died. Doctors said he’d have survived maybe another half hour. He owes you his life.” He cracked a sarcastic smile. “Maybe the first good deed a reporter has ever done.”
She punched him in the arm playfully, then gestured up the beach, where Run had collapsed on the sand to gnaw on a piece of driftwood twice her size. “I did what anyone would have done.”
They walked in silence for a long time, Anna glancing over every now and then like she had something to say but couldn’t find the right words. They reached the park at Point No Point, Run following behind them but staying at least ten feet away at all times. Austin had learned that she feared getting too close because she didn’t want to be captured and leashed. Maybe he should have trained her better, but the treats in his pocket were the only way he could be sure she’d let him catch her when it was time to go home.
Anna sat cross-legged on the bench. “You’re not ready, are you?”
Austin stretched out his legs and laced his hands behind his head. “Ready for what? Did Ridley tell you about the consulting gig he offered?”
“He did tell me about that, but that’s not what I was asking.”
“Then what did you mean?”
“Ready to date.”
Austin looked at her. She wasn’t asking for a story. She was asking for herself. He smiled. “I’m flattered.”
“But you’re not ready?”
He shook his head. “Fiona and I had a running joke. I told her once that if anything ever happened to me, I’d want her to find someone new. I knew my job came with risk. I told her I’d want her to be happy, whatever that meant for her.”
Anna cocked her head. “So what was the joke?”
“She told me that if anything ever happened to her, she’d want me to live the rest of my life as a monk. Celibate and miserable.”
Anna laughed. “Like you said, it was a joke. You know she wouldn’t actually want that.”
“I told her I wouldn’t remain celibate and miserable for her. I’d do it because I wouldn’t want to subject any other woman to being married to me. That was part of the joke. She’d signed on early—had no way out—but I couldn’t with a clear conscience subject another woman I cared about to a life with me.”
“Why not?”
Austin took the ball from his feet and tossed it down the beach to the edge of the water. Run sprinted after it, spraying sand behind her.
Anna pointed at a large sailboat gliding by, far out on the water. “You ever see anyone standing on the bow of one of those boats, arms raised, shouting ‘I’m king of the world!’”
He shrugged. “I’m guessing that’s from a TV show I should have seen?”
She shook her head. “Did you spend the nineties under a rock? You can’t tell me you didn’t see Titanic. You just can’t. I mean, Celine Dion, ‘draw me like one of your French girls,’ could Jack have fit on the plank at the end?”
He stared at her, blank faced.
“I simply have to find out how you’ve spent your time. Like, what do you watch?”
“Interviews with suspects, mostly. Sometimes sports.”
She laughed. “Well, invite me over sometime, we’ll watch Titanic together.”
“Maybe. As friends.”
“So, why not? Why’d you tell Fiona you wouldn’t date again?”
“The danger. I have a way of doing things. Reckless.” He frowned at her. “And by the way, you’ve got the same damn problem.”
“I know.”
“The way you came at Mary Bonner like a Seahawks linebacker? Not exactly by-the-book.”
“I know. It’s how I do my reporting, too.”
“I told Fiona that if anything ever happened to her, I’d never subject anyone else to the stuff she had to worry about.”
“But you’re not an officer anymore. Ridley said he didn’t think you were going to accept his offer. Not much danger flipping burgers and selling bait, is there?”
Austin pulled a folded piece of paper out of the back pocket of his jeans and handed it to her. It was the business license that had come in the mail that morning.
She read it, then handed it back. “Thomas Austin, Private Investigator. I like the sound of it. So you took the job with Ridley?”
Austin gestured down the beach, where Run was battling a piece of kelp that had washed ashore. “No, I didn’t.”
“I don’t understand. I thought he said he needed you to get a PI license as a formality to make it all legal.”
“He did, and I’ll work with them. Maybe, from time to time. But not on contract. I’m going it alone.”
She considered this. “You’re going to be an actual PI? For hire?”
He tapped on the plaque she’d given him. “Comes down to it, I agree with the sentiment. The world is worth saving. And I agree with Fiona’s plaque, too. But I can’t sign on to another police force, even as a consultant. Not now and not ever again. Case by case, I’ll work for anyone who has a just cause. But that’s not limited to Ridley and his team.”
“Have you taken on your first case yet?” she asked.
“Haven’t even hung my shingle.”
“Then buy me a beer and a burger.” She pointed up the beach to his café. “I hear that joint has the best burgers in town.”
He laughed. “We’ve got the only burgers in town.”
“Good enough for me.”
