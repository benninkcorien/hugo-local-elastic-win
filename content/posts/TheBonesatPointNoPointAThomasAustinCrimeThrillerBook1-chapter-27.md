Chapter 26
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
It was nearly midnight at the Kitsap Sheriff’s Office, but no one was sleeping. After Austin’s outburst, Trisha Simone’s lawyer had huddled with his client for thirty minutes before appearing in the hallway and offering a single, weary sentence. “Against my legal advice, she’s ready to come clean.”
Now Austin, Ridley, Lucy, and a video camera watched Trisha’s every move and hung on her every word.
“It started the week before Thanksgiving.” Trisha stroked Itsy slowly as she spoke. The presence of the tiny dog had been a condition of telling the truth. “I got a message through the app. Hundred and twenty bucks to ferry some legal documents from Bremerton to Seattle.”
“Where was the pickup?” Ridley asked.
Trisha hung her head. “Saint Michaels. The hospital.”
Austin heard a thin stream of air whistling through Ridley’s teeth. He was pissed, likely because he was thinking exactly what Austin was thinking: if Trisha had put two and two together when she’d heard that Allie Shreever had been found dead in Hansville, she could have prevented Joshua’s kidnapping.
“Who gave you the documents?” Austin asked.
“Woman, white, maybe fifties or sixties.”
“What else?” Ridley demanded. “Every. Single. Detail.”
Trisha closed her eyes tight, trying to find the memories. “She was wearing sunglasses and scrubs. A nurse. Seemed nice and all. Documents were in a yellow envelope. I didn’t ask her anything about them, but she said they were the final paperwork for her divorce. Said they had to be delivered that day. Something about a settlement.”
“Name?” Ridley said.
“In the app it was Suzanne Brown.”
“Did she ever refer to herself by another name?” Austin asked.
Trisha thought for a moment, then shook her head.
They needed to get back to the physical description, but first Austin was hoping they’d get lucky with an address or some other key detail that would lead them to Joshua. “Where was the drop-off spot?” Austin asked.
“That was the weird thing. The woman had written the wrong address on the envelope. When I got there, there was no legal office at the address. It was a grocery store. I got in touch with her through the app and I didn’t hear from her until the next day. Brought the documents back with me. When she wrote she said it was her mistake—she’d written the wrong street name. But it was no big deal because she’d figured out how to file the paperwork online. I met her the next day, gave her back the paperwork, and she gave me a sixty-dollar tip through the app for my trouble.”
Austin considered this, then turned to Ridley. “She was testing her. Seeing if she could be trusted.”
Ridley nodded. “Please, continue. How’d you end up leaving that bag on the beach in Hansville?”
“About a week later, she contacted me again, saying she had a special job and could she contact me outside the app? Now, we’re not supposed to do that—the app wants their fifteen percent cut, after all—but she seemed like a decent woman, so I gave her my cell.”
“So you broke the operating agreement of the app?” Ridley asked.
Trisha’s eyes flashed at Ridley. “Everyone does it. You really want to give me shit about that of all things?”
The lawyer held up the phone. “Ms. Simone has agreed to show you the messages she received in exchange for two things. Mr. Austin, she’d like you to decline to press charges against Mr. Baxter. And Detective Calvin, she’d like your word that you’ll put in a good word should she face an intent-to-distribute without a license charge, or any charges related to the next phase of her interaction with the woman calling herself Suzanne Brown.”
Austin and Ridley both nodded. Trisha entered the password and the lawyer handed Ridley the phone.
Itsy had fallen asleep and Trisha rocked her like a baby as she spoke. “It was a pretty quick thing. She offered me five hundred bucks to pick up a sack from one location in Hansville and drop it in another.”
“Hansville?” Austin asked, surprised. “The pick up, too?”
She nodded.
“And that didn’t seem odd to you?” Ridley asked, a biting tone creeping into his voice.
“Sure it did.” Trisha laughed. “But it also sounded like rent money.” She looked from Ridley to Austin, from Austin to Lucy. “Weed business sucks since they made it legal, and I’m guessing none of you have ever been poor. Like, really poor. Like, will-I-be-sleeping-in-my-truck? poor.” She shook her head. “Anyway, that's what I did. Knew it might be sketchy, but honestly she seemed like a decent woman.”
Ridley’s eyes were on the phone. “And the pickup location was at the end of Northwest 360th?”
Trisha nodded.
Lucy’s eyes were skeptical. “She was paying you five hundred dollars to pick up a bag and take it a mile away? And you agreed to that?”
“Read the texts,” Trisha said, defensively. “Said it was one of those Instagram scavenger hunt things people do. She’d left the final prize in the wrong spot and had to pull a double at the hospital. Her whole family was in town and could I move it?”
“And you believed that?” Lucy asked.
“Honestly, I did. I know how stupid it looks now.” She closed her eyes and sighed. “Maybe I just wanted to believe.”
Austin shook his head. The things people would believe when money was on the line.
Trisha’s lawyer raised a finger. “I’d like to highlight the fact that at no time did Ms. Simone take any action she thought illegal, or even immoral.”
“C’mon,” Lucy said. “I’d believe she thought it was a drug drop. That would at least make logical sense. No bleeping way she bought the scavenger hunt thing.”
The lawyer shrugged, a smirk across his face. “We disagree.”
Lucy glared at him, then at Trisha. “And you didn’t look in the bag?”
Trisha shook her head.
“Why’d you snap the photos of the bag?” Austin asked.
“Just to prove I’d made the drop. Like package delivery drivers do.”
Ridley held up the phone to Lucy. “Take down Suzanne Brown’s phone number and check with Samantha. It’s almost certainly a burner, but find out anything you can.” Lucy jotted down the number. “While you’re out there, get me a printout of every house back in the woods around 360th. And call around. See if you can convince any of our sketch artists to come in.”
“It’s midnight on Saturday, boss.”
His look told her he didn’t care. She nodded. She didn’t care either.
When Lucy had gone, Austin turned to Ridley. “I’ve driven past Northeast 360th a hundred times. Always noticed it. Never been down there, though.” Austin had thought it odd that there’d be a 360th street in a tiny beach town where streets had names like Shoreview, Cedar Grove, Heron, and Sandy Cove.
“Dirt road,” Ridley said. “Some gravel. Lots of little side roads, maybe thirty or forty houses altogether.”
Austin made a mental note of this before asking Trisha, “At any time did she contact you by phone call?”
“No.”
“Do you have another phone she might have contacted you on?”
“No.”
“After she asked to contact you outside the app, did she ever again contact you within the app?”
“No.”
Austin was growing frustrated. He could tell this wasn’t going to get them where they needed to go. “Did your looks ever come up? The fact that you look a little like Lorraine D’Antonia?”
“What are you implying?” the lawyer asked.
Austin ignored him, eyes locked on Trisha.
“I don’t think I look much like her. But no, it never came up.”
“The five hundred bucks. Please tell me she sent that via PayPal or something?”
Trisha shook her head. “Cash, in an envelope with the bag.”
A worried look crossed her lawyer’s face.
He’d noticed the same hole in her story that Austin had. “You said you believed her story about the treasure hunt. That she was working and couldn’t move the bag. And yet somehow she managed to leave five hundred dollars in cash with the bag, with your name on it?”
Trisha looked at her lawyer, who shrugged. She should have taken his advice and refused to speak.
“Okay,” she admitted, “that lady cop was right. I thought it was a drug thing.”
“And when you saw the police outside your apartment,” Ridley said, “you ran because you’d figured out that you were an accomplice to the murder of Allie Shreever?”
She closed her eyes. “That, plus the weed I had in my place.”
“We’ll get back to money,” Ridley said. “We want the bills she gave you. Forensics. Low priority at this point.”
Austin agreed. They already knew the identity and home address of the suspected killer, Mary Bonner. Plus, bank notes were notoriously difficult to fingerprint, but it was worth a shot. It would be useful if this thing ever went to trial, but not much help achieving their number one priority: locating Mary Bonner and, they hoped, a living Joshua Green.
“To be clear,” Austin said, “You had zero contact with this person outside the two meetings at the hospital, the texts we’re now reading, and the exchanges you had within the TaskRabbit app?”
“That’s right.”
Ridley pulled up a chair beside her. “This next part is important, Trisha, and I want you to close your eyes and really think.” His tone was warm now, fatherly despite the fact that Trisha had a dozen or so years on him. “I want you to think about what she looked like. Really try to picture her.”
“She was wearing sunglasses.” Trisha looked down at Itsy like the answer might be found on the top of her tiny head. “A facemask, like she’d just come out of surgery.”
“Tattoos, identifying marks? Scars on what skin was visible?”
“I really wasn’t looking for anything like that. She seemed like she was in a hurry.”
“Think,” Ridley implored her.
“She was about my height, similar frame. Slight, like me.”
“How’d she walk?”
Trisha considered this. “Quick. Purposeful. She wasn’t some rickety old lady.”
“What was her voice like?”
“I don’t know. Normal?”
“Accent?”
“Nothing major,” Trisha said. “Sounded like she was from here.”
Ridley and Trisha went around and around about the woman’s appearance for another five minutes before Ridley gave up. Trisha’s story matched up with all the facts, but it hadn’t brought them much closer to locating Mary Bonner.
Samantha had failed to find a single photo of Bonner online and was working on other sources. Officers were staked out at her apartment, and by morning Ridley would have a search warrant. But Austin didn’t think that would do much good. He doubted she’d ever brought Joshua there, doubted she’d left any evidence about her location. Mary Bonner was in the wind, and she’d brought Joshua Green with her.
The one thing Trisha had provided that might bear fruit was the location of the pickup of the bones. That was the next lead to work.
Austin pulled Ridley into the hallway, where Lucy was leaning against a wall as though trying to catch a nap. “Northeast 360th.”
“Way ahead of you,” Ridley said. “Crack of dawn I’ll be there with everyone I can get, knocking on doors.”
“I’m with you,” Lucy said, yawning. She handed Ridley a printout. “Forty-two houses in all. Addresses, names of owners. So far, no connection to Mary Bonner.”
Austin said, “If we’re lucky, she has a place there. Even if not, she was there, and maybe someone spotted her. Maybe she drove there and someone has a driveway camera.”
Austin yawned. The coffee had made him jittery, but he was no longer the thirty-something detective who could pull all-nighters like a college student.
Ridley stretched his arms over his head, tapping the ceiling with a fingertip. “You’ve done a helluva job,” Ridley said. “Go home. Get a few hours of sleep. Tomorrow’s gonna be a long day.”
“But—”
“You, too,” he said to Lucy, ignoring Austin’s objection. “I’m gonna finish up with Trisha and catch a few hours on the couch. Don’t worry, Trisha’s not going anywhere.”
Austin reluctantly agreed, but only after Ridley had promised to call him the second they got into Mary Bonner’s apartment.
