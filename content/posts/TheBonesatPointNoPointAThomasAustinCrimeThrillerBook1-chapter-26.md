Chapter 25
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
She nibbled the edge of a Christmas-tree-shaped cookie, cracking the crispy bits of sugar between her front teeth. The sound of crunching was loud in the tiny kitchen. Or maybe it only seemed loud now that Joshua had settled down for a nap.
The little angel slept so soundly. He radiated warmth and goodness.
Had she slept like that as a baby? She doubted it. Her home had not been filled with the smells of Christmas. She’d never been as loved as Joshua.
Outside, the wind howled through the cedar trees, battering the little cabin. But she was warm, so warm. And so was Joshua. She’d given him a wonderful home these last couple days. Memories that would last for the rest of her life.
And the rest of his.
She tensed suddenly, inadvertently.
A noise from outside. And it wasn’t the wind. More of a thud, like a bird flying into the side of the cabin, which had happened once before. Or a tree branch falling onto the roof, which happened every time there was a storm.
It was probably nothing. But the article in the newspaper had her worried. That bitch Anna Downey had gone snooping around at the hospital. She could ruin everything.
Hurrying out of the kitchen, she passed into the living room. The curtains were drawn. Creeping slowly, she reached the wall next to the front door and rested a knee on the arm of the couch. Carefully, she leaned toward the window, peeling back the curtain slowly, ever so slowly. Just an inch.
She saw nothing.
Another sound, a rumbling series of clicks. An engine starting up. Her mind raced to little Joshua. Had they found them? Had they come for her boy?
She heard tires over gravel.
Tires over gravel.
Getting fainter.
Fainter?
She peered out the window again. A van was leaving her house. An Amazon delivery van.
Her shoulders dropped. She let out a long breath and opened the front door. With a quick dip and grab, she swooped up the brown box.
Back at the kitchen table, she checked on Joshua. Precious angel hadn’t noticed a thing. He shifted a little, moving his pudgy little arm onto his forehead like he was trying to block out the sun.
His present was here, but she was glad he was asleep. That way it would be a surprise.
She pulled open the box, busting through the brown packing tape easily with a long fingernail. The crinkle of plastic packaging always made her happy, and today was no exception.
She pulled out the bag and dumped its contents on the table. The description on the website had said it was “The perfect item for holiday gift-giving.”
She agreed.
It was a small, felt gift bag. Mostly red and decorated with little green Christmas trees, white snowflakes, and even a miniature sleigh with a jolly Santa saying “Ho-Ho-Ho.”
She brought the packaging to the garbage and set the bag down in the middle of the table. It seemed small.
She wondered if it would be big enough. Little Joshua was growing by the minute, after all.
Then she remembered Allie Shreever. She’d been about the same size and had posed no problems. After all, a baby’s body was over seventy percent water.
She glanced at the large canning pot, silver and shiny, sitting on her stove.
And most of the rest was meat.
