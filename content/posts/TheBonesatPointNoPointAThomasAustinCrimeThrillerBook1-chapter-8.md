Chapter 7
CHAPTER SEVEN
“Turn up the sound!” Austin said, walking toward the bar, where the TV was mounted on the wall.
Andy unmuted the TV and the voice of a solemn-sounding male news anchor filled the tiny café. “Tragic news out of Bainbridge Island, Washington today, where an infant boy was apparently kidnapped overnight. Details are few and far between at this time, but our reporter Sandra Chang has been at the scene all morning, trying to learn more. Sandra, what can you tell us?”
The shot changed to a wide-angle of a residential street, where a reporter stood in front of a backdrop of large homes with lovely gardens and pristine, manicured yards. As the shot zoomed in on the reporter, one house in particular stood out. Surrounded by yellow police tape, it was an impressive modern home—right angles of steel and glass and fine wood—with a silver BMW parked on a gorgeous stone driveway. “Thanks, Chet, and yes, I’m live on the western edge of Bainbridge Island, where police say a boy of only three weeks was taken from his crib either late last night or early this morning. The family is not speaking at this time, and names are being withheld for privacy, but sources say the family is distraught. So far, police say, no suspects have emerged, but in the minds of many, the similarities to a recent kidnapping in Bremerton are unavoidable. The victim in that case was recently found deceased after a desperate search for the missing child came up empty.”
The shot changed to footage from earlier in the day—based on the darker sky it looked like dawn. The reporter hurried after a uniformed officer, shouting questions. “Officer, can you comment on similarities between this case the and the kidnapping and murder of Allie Shreever? Officer, is there a serial kidnapper on the loose in Kitsap County?”
The officer, who’d been hurrying into the house, stopped and turned. It was Jimmy, the younger deputy detective who’d helped with the video the day before. He had a frustrated look on his face, a look Austin knew well. Most detectives were desperate to find information and clues, especially in the early hours of a case. The last thing they wanted to do was answer questions, especially when the answer would require wild speculation. Jimmy opened his mouth to speak, bit his lower lip, then continued past the police tape and into the house.
“Damn pirates. So sad,” Mrs. McGuilicutty said. “Used to be such a safe area.”
Austin looked confused. “Pirates?”
“Yeah New York, she calls them pirates.” Mr. McGuilicutty shook his head and sucked air through his teeth.
Mrs. McGuilicutty grew animated. “Robbers come in on their boats, stop on the beaches, and take what they please before escaping on the water. Stole my jewelry.”
Mr. McGuilicutty waved a hand dismissively. “It happened one time. In 1974. Now everything is pirates this and pirates that.”
“Turn it off,” Austin said. “Or turn to something else.”
Andy flicked over to the sports news.
Austin retrieved the coffee pot from behind the bar, refilled the cups for his only two patrons, then walked out to the small beach area in front of his café. A lone fisherman stood in the Sound, water up to his waist, dressed in rubber coveralls and a thick hooded sweatshirt. A cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth, leaving his hands free as he cast his line far out in the water, then slowly reeled it back in. Austin had learned during his first winter in Hansville that, while the summer was by far the busiest, a handful of locals fished year round, even though the best salmon didn’t run in the winter. If the guy was lucky, he might nab a chum or dog salmon, but the King and Chinook wouldn’t be back for months.
Far out in the water, halfway between Hansville and Edmonds, a tugboat pulled a giant flat of scrap metal, probably on its way to China. From May to September, dozens of cruise ships passed by his little stretch of beach regularly, heading to and from Alaska. Half of him wished he could hop on one right now. The report had sparked his curiosity, that sharp ping of tart cherries to which he’d once been addicted. It was the thrill of the unknown—the mystery—mingled with the righteous indignation he felt toward the perpetrators of crimes against children.
For years, that feeling had gotten him out of bed in the morning and kept him at the office late into the night. It’s why he and Fiona worked like hell and never had children. He still felt it, but now there was a desire to flee alongside it.
As Detective Calvin had said, this was a copycat, but a damn good one. The details of the Allie Shreever kidnapping and murder were right out of Lorraine D’Antonia’s playbook. Based on the news report, the new case appeared to follow the same pattern. Austin had worked copycat murder cases before. The perpetrators always turned out to be obsessed with the original killers, gathering everything they could from the news, trial records, even leaked police reports. But the poems etched into the bones had never come out—not in the news and not at trial. If D’Antonia hadn’t been behind bars, Austin would have bet his life she was involved. Now, it had to be someone close to the case, or someone who’d gotten hold of photographs or files that had never seen the light of day. Either way, if the copycat was determined to follow D’Antonia’s MO. It meant the baby had about three days to live.
A light drizzle began to fall. Austin shoved his hands in his pockets and watched the rain pitter-patter the water, colliding with the small ripples moving toward the shore from the wake of the ship.
Austin yanked his cellphone from his pocket and found a spot where his reception went from one bar to two, just enough to make a call.
Detective Calvin picked up after two rings. “Hello?”
“Rid, it’s Thomas Austin.”
“You heard?”
“I heard.”
“And? I’m pretty damn busy right now.”
“It’s December 22nd. By Christmas morning, the bones of that child will be in a decorative Christmas bag unless we find… him? Her?”
“Him. Joshua Green.” Austin heard voices in the background, cars passing. Ridley was likely at the scene of the kidnapping. “You said ‘we’?”
“I won’t take payment. I don’t want anything to be official. Even if this is a copycat—and it is—I’ll likely be able to help. Put me in where you need me and I’ll do everything I can to catch the monster behind this.”
“I’m heading back to the office. How soon can you get there?”
