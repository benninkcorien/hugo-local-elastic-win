Chapter 44
CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR
Bonner immediately disappeared further up the bluff as Austin sprinted to the ledge and looked down. He couldn’t see Anna or Joshua but he heard a single word. “Help.”
Sitting on his backside, he grabbed a root that cascaded down the bluff. Sliding carefully, he lowered himself down, thankful to see that the cliff had a slight angle. It wasn’t a sheer drop to the beach below.
As he descended five feet, then ten, then fifteen, he bumped over rocks and roots, causing a minor avalanche of dirt. His feet struck something, an outcropping of rock.
“Thomas?” It was Anna’s voice.
To his left, barely visible, she was tangled in vines and covered in dirt, clinging to both Joshua and the root system of a fallen tree protruding from the bank.
Austin squinted at Joshua’s face in the moonlight. “Is he…”
As if in answer, Joshua let out a scream.
Anna said, “He’s okay. I don’t think he hit his head. Drop down the rest of the way, then I will hand him down.”
Austin used the vines to descend the last ten feet to the beach, then Anna slowly lowered Joshua into his arms.
She followed him down, then took Joshua from him. She pointed back up the bluff. “Follow her.”
Austin gave her a long look, an appreciative nod, then used the roots and vines to pull himself back up the cliff.
When he’d reached the top, he listened, breathing hard. He glanced back toward the parking lot and saw flashing lights. Backup was here.
He took off up the bluff, walking fast but stopping every few paces to listen. He followed the cliff’s edge as he thought Bonner had done. He knew this path. To his right, it continued up through the woods, eventually coming out on the road not far from Bonner’s little house on Heron Avenue. Her other option was to find a spot to slide down to the beach. From there it was eight or ten miles to Kingston, where she could catch a ferry, find a car, or, perhaps find a place to lay low.
He reached a point where the path jutted off sharply to the right, and the beach curved to the left. He couldn’t stay halfway between them anymore. He paused. Would Bonner cut off in the direction of the road and the house, drop down to the beach, or would she stick to the forest and the cliff?
“Austin.” Her voice came clear and strong from the edge of the cliff.
He turned.
“Do you want to know what I meant? How you got everything wrong?”
He stepped toward her. She held a rock about the size of a baseball above her head, the moonlight illuminating its jagged edges. He wasn’t sure what she was thinking. There was no way she could hit him with it from that distance. When he’d bolted from his kitchen, he’d been too out of it to grab his gun, but if he wanted to take her down, it wouldn’t be hard. One way or another, he had her.
“Mary, I—”
“I will do the talking, Austin.”
“You’re not going to throw that rock at me. Face it, it’s over.”
She stepped back toward the cliff. “You will look better if you take me alive.” She turned, glanced down, the rock still over her head.
She had no intention of throwing it at him. She was going to hit herself with it.
“Do not do this, Mary. Do not jump. It may seem like the best thing, but it isn’t. If you live, you will be able to see Lorraine again.”
The truth was, he wanted her alive for a lot of reasons. He’d worked dozens of murders. Between those and his own experience, he knew that nothing could ever fully heal the wounds the families of victims suffered. But he’d also learned that the process of seeing the killer brought to justice usually offered some solace. Murderers who took their own lives when captured left an even bigger wound in the families they’d destroyed.
“Talk to me, Mary. It’s just you and me. I know people in the news. I can help you get your story out there. About the Bonners. The nursing home. It won’t undo what you’ve done, but it will make people understand. What did you mean when you said I had it wrong?”
Again she laughed, and this one was even more disturbing than the last. It was as though darkness itself had taken up residence inside her and was trying to escape. “When I said my sister was innocent, I wasn’t lying. You’ve had the wrong person locked up this entire time.”
