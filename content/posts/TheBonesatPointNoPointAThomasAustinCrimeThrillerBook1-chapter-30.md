Chapter 29
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
According to the GPS, they were five minutes from Myrian Brightstone’s house when Lucy glanced at Austin with an odd look on her face, one he couldn’t read. “Your wife was in law enforcement, too, right?’
“Assistant DA. So, not a cop, but yeah.”
“A cop and a prosecutor. Quite the couple.”
“Seemed to work for us. Why do you ask?”
“I know how she passed away, and I’m sorry, but can I ask you something?” She gripped the steering wheel nervously.
He thought he knew where this was headed. “About Jimmy?”
She smiled, embarrassed. “Can it work to have a couple in the same general line of work?”
Austin considered this. “Fiona and I never worked directly together. Same ballpark, but I only testified in her prosecutions a couple times. New York is a big town. Not like here.”
Lucy swerved around a branch that had fallen onto the road. “What if you worked together every day?”
“Well, right now I’d take anything I could get. I’d spend the rest of my life dropping fries at McDonald’s if she was standing next to me slapping pickles on burgers. But, I know what you’re asking. And, no, I don’t think it would’ve been good if we’d been working side by side.”
“Why not?”
“My dad gave me one good piece of advice about women. He died when I was a teenager, just when I was starting to date. He told me, ‘Find a woman who’s as different from you as possible, while still sharing the same core values.’”
“So how was Fiona different?”
“She was more of a thinker—sometimes an over-thinker—I’m more of a charge-in-and-ask-questions-later kind of guy. She was a valedictorian, I lived by the motto: ‘C’s-get-degrees.’ She liked to plan vacations down to the minute. I was fine to buy a ticket, throw some clothes in a duffel bag, and figure it out when we got there. I was impulsive, she was, well, not. We drove each other crazy for a while, but once we learned to appreciate each other…”
“Smooth sailing?”
Austin nodded. “Not that it was perfect, but we were lucky, and we both knew it. So, Jimmy?”
“He’s… I don’t know. What do you think?”
“Really can’t say. Don’t know him well.”
She gave him a skeptical eyebrow raise. “You’re a pretty good detective, and I’ve never met a detective who didn’t take pride in getting a quick read on everyone they met.”
Austin chuckled. “Well, let me ask you this: he slept at your place last night and—” when she held up a hand to object, he pushed it away. “Don’t bother denying it. Like you said, I’m a pretty good detective.”
She smiled. “We were together for a bit when he started. On and off since. We try not to make it obvious.”
Austin chuckled. “You must not try very hard.”
“So, what about him sleeping over?”
“Lemme ask you this: when you arrived, you knew Ridley wanted you in the office right away. You also knew you didn’t want to come in at the exact same time. Part of your ingenious plan to hide your relationship?”
“Correct,” she said, slowing long enough to wave at the guys in the patrol car sitting at the end of Myrian Brightstone’s driveway, which was lined with mature trees. The house sat next to a small lake, its surface dappled by rainfall.
“So,” Austin said, “who’s idea was it for you to come in first?”
“What?”
“I mean, out in the parking lot, you got there at the same time after going to Starbucks together. You’re nervous about your relationship being obvious. You had to decide who would go in first and who would wait a few minutes, then come in.”
“What are you getting at?” Lucy parked the car in front of a gently-sloping lawn, which led toward the house.
Actually, toward the mansion. It was much too big for a single woman living on a nurse’s salary. From the driveway, it looked to Austin to be around four-thousand square feet. A three-story Queen Anne with lake views, it looked like the setting for a cute bed-and-breakfast, not home to a party animal in her early-thirties.
He got out and caught Lucy’s eye over the top of the car. “You’re a good detective, what do you think I’m getting at?”
“I have no idea, but I remember, it was his idea for me to go in first.”
“He knows you’re a future leader,” Austin said. “Lucy O’Lieutenant. He didn’t want you to miss a moment. If someone had to be late, he wanted it to be him.”
Lucy smiled and rapped the top of the car with her knuckles, then headed for the house.
“My read on him is that he’s a decent guy,” Austin said, following her. “I’m guessing you’ve had the thought that you’re too smart for him at least once. Trust me, so has he. But I’ll take a meathead with a good heart over a brilliant jerk any day. Plus, he seems to understand how technology works. If I ever date again, that’ll be the number one quality I look for in a woman.”
Lucy chuckled and, as they took the stairs to the wide porch, she pointed at the doorknob. It was polished bronze, and carved with an eagle. “Maybe we should be looking into her for money laundering or something.”
“Family money?”
“Could be. Or house sitting.”
Lucy rang the bell, which echoed loudly. Nothing.
Austin banged on the door. Nothing.
Lucy rang again. Still nothing.
Austin tried the door handle. Locked. “We know she’s in there.” He gave Lucy a wry look. “I have reason to believe she’s in danger.” He cocked his head, asking permission to bust through.
“Give it another sec,” Lucy said, ringing the bell and pounding at the same time.
Austin stepped back, examining the door. He hadn’t kicked one in for a couple years, and this one looked pretty damn sturdy. Five, maybe six inches of solid oak.
“You sure you can make it through?” Lucy asked.
He shrugged. “No, but there’s only one way to find out.”
“We’ve got reason enough,” Lucy said. “Let’s go.”
Austin tensed, readying himself for the launch and kick.
“Wait.” Lucy put her ear to the door. “Stairs.”
Austin relaxed. Now he heard it. A creaking from the house. Then footsteps.
The creaking grew louder, then went quiet. The light behind the peephole changed just enough to let Austin know someone was peering through it. Then the door opened slowly with a long, sighing creak.
“Who the hell are you?” Myrian Brightstone’s voice sounded like the croak of a sick bullfrog. A hoarse, throaty tone that Austin might’ve expected out of a chain smoking soldier on his deathbed, not the thirty-something that stood before them. She wore tight black pants and a sparkly red top, probably her clothes from the night before. Her makeup had been put on heavily, but had smeared over time leaving black lines on her cheeks near her eyes, and lipstick around her lips and across the side of her face.
Lucy said, “I’m detective Lucy O’Rourke. This is Thomas Austin, a consultant on a case we’re working. May we come in?”
“No.” Brightstone swayed to the left, catching herself in the doorway before falling over. “I’m drunk as hell right now.” She gripped the doorway with one hand and rubbed the heel of the other into her eye, further smearing her makeup. “Woke me up. What did you say you were here for?”
“We didn’t say,” Austin said. Under normal circumstances, he might have started with a slow build, striking a little fear into her by asking about why she’d disappeared from work. But time was not on their side. “Mary Bonner. Do you know where she is?”
“You’re kinda cute,” Brightstone said, her words barely comprehensible. Then she looked at Lucy. “You are, too, but I’m looking for a sugar daddy. Oh, I’m going to get fired alright.” Then, as though her brain had finally processed the question, she said, “Mary? I know her. Yeah.”
“Do you know where she is?” Lucy asked.
Brightstone shook her head.
“Do you know if she has a residence other than her apartment in Bremerton?”
“Pfft…I’m not friends with her.”
“We know that,” Lucy said, pulling out her phone. She held up screenshots of the Facebook post Samantha had found. “You bullied her online.”
Brightstone glanced at the phone, shrugged. “I’m kind of a bitch. It’s, like, my thing. I don’t give a rat’s ass.” She leaned in closer, eyes moving heavily as though she was struggling to read the post. Then she laughed. “No lie detected. She’s weird as hell.”
“How so?” Austin asked.
She licked her lips in what was possibly the least-seductive gesture Austin had ever seen. “Listen, I broke up with my boyfriend last week. So, if you have any interest I…”
“That why you’ve been missing work?” Lucy asked. “Seems like you’ve been on a bit of a bender.”
“I used to D.J. Parents made me go to nursing school. Only let me live here if I hold down a job.” She scratched her head suddenly, forcefully, like some invisible fly had landed on it. “Act responsibly and all that.”
“Mary Bonner,” Austin insisted. “How was she odd?”
“Just distant. I mean, she’s old enough to be my mom and too old to have her own children. Super-obsessed with the babies and—”
Austin’s attention dropped to his phone, vibrating in his pocket. He had a new text from Anna:
I feel bad about the photo. So here’s something, a tip: cabin on Heron Avenue in Hansville. You on that yet?
Brightstone wagged a finger at him drunkenly. “Um, excuse-a-MWAH, but it’s kinda rude to read a text in the middle of a conversation, ya know?”
“Sorry,” Austin said, “I… let’s finish this up.”
Lucy asked, “When did you last see Mary Bonner?”
“Whenever it was I last worked with her. Week ago, maybe.”
“We noticed there are no photos of her online, none that we can find anyway.”
“She didn’t like to be photographed. Probably because she was…” Brightstone cackled. “That’s why she was so weird. She had a head wound. Someone beat her with the ugly stick.”
“Is this her?” Lucy held up the hospital surveillance photo.
Brightstone nodded.
“Are you certain she’s not on any social media?”
“I mean, I don’t get all in her business, but she’s old, right?”
Austin asked, “She’s never mentioned a weekend house, a cabin, maybe Hansville, Heron Avenue?”
Brightstone just shook her head, humming some odd tune as though they weren’t there. Then suddenly, she said, “Wait here. I might have something.”
She staggered back up the creaky staircase, leaving the door open.
Austin showed Lucy the text.
After reading it twice, she said, “Screenshot it, send it to Jimmy and Ridley, then write her back and ask for more details.”
Austin did so and, by the time he’d finished, Brightstone was back, and she seemed to be holding a stack of photos. “Christmas party a couple years ago. I was in my ironic-retro Polaroid phase… anyway… Mary would come and, like, pretend to be a person for an evening. She didn’t like to be in photos, but…” She sorted through the stack of photos, squinting at them as she placed one on top of another. “Boom! I knew it.” She held up a photo.
Austin took it in. The shock hit him first, then the confusion, then the horror.
Lucy turned to him, eyes wide. “What the hell is going on?”
