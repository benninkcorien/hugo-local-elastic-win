Chapter 40
CHAPTER FORTY
The house was nice, she thought. Nicer than her old family cabin. It didn’t smell like cookies, but it would do for now.
The living room was spare, like a bachelor pad. A black leather couch, two cream-colored armchairs with a little table between them. Two photographs hung on the wall: an old black and white picture of the Brooklyn Bridge and a photograph of a woman in a Navy uniform. Probably Austin’s mother. She had the same dark hair, the same nose, the same intelligent blue eyes.
No doubt she’d been a real mother, loved him and nurtured him every step of the way. Not like her mother. Not like either of her mothers. Hers had given her away to an orphanage that had offered her up to a fate worse than death.
Poverty. Violence. A dog cage when she misbehaved. “Good solid discipline,” her mother had called it.
She’d had it rough. Rougher than her sister, by far. But still she’d made it through, and she’d turned out alright.
She checked on Joshua, asleep in the bedroom. She’d had to tape his mouth closed to keep him from crying, but he was smart. He’d learned to breathe through his nose. She peeled off the tape slowly. He moved a little, but didn’t wake.
On the floor next to the bed, the reporter sat slumped against the wall. She’d bound her wrists and ankles and gagged her mouth. “I’m going to take off your gag. If you scream, the people in the restaurant will hear you. They will come running, but the baby will be dead before they get here.” She held up the long kitchen knife she’d used to stab the officer who’d come in her house without an invitation. “I will be captured and taken to jail, yes. But I will leave you alive to live with the fact that you are a selfish bitch who chose her own life over that of a helpless baby.” She met the reporter’s frightened eyes. “So, will you scream?”
The reporter shook her head no.
She removed the gag. “When will he come home?”
The reporter stretched out her mouth, adjusting to the new freedom. “I don’t know. He’s probably out looking for you with the police.”
“Do you have a boat?”
“I already told you, no. I don’t even live here. I live ten miles away.”
“Do you have another car at your house?”
“No, and even if I did, I’m sure the road out of town is blocked.” The reporter frowned. “Can I ask you something?”
She did not like reporters, but maybe this one could help her tell the truth, help her get Lorraine freed. She nodded.
“Are you Lorraine D’Antonia’s sister?”
“Her twin.”
“Do you really believe that killing like her will convince anyone to let her go?”
“They will have to.”
“No, they really won’t. All they will do is put you in jail with her.”
“With her?” That sounded good, better than the life she was living.
“Not with her. Not in the same cell. But maybe you’d get to see her sometimes. Maybe they’d allow visits. I can help you. I know people at the prison.”
“You’re lying!” she spat. “Just like reporters lied about Lorraine.”
“I promise that soon someone is going to find us here. Even if no one saw us come in, they are going to knock on that door. When they do, we might all die. They will not hesitate to shoot if they think it could save Joshua. Let me call someone I trust. You can get on the phone and they will take you out of here alive as long as Joshua is not hurt. I swear I will help you see Lorraine again.”
She scratched her head, thinking. She didn’t like this reporter. She returned to her side and gagged her again, tying the cloth even tighter than before. Tightening it until she squirmed in pain.
She walked to the doorway and turned. “They will let me live, let me go to Lorraine, even if I only have one hostage. We will call someone like you said. But it’s Christmas Eve, and first there’s something I need to do. For Joshua.”
She walked to the kitchen and peered in the fridge. Ketchup, some carrot sticks and lunch meat, a few beers. Typical bachelor. If his wife was still alive, she probably would have done a better job of stocking it.
She cracked a beer and leaned on the kitchen table. On the floor was a dog dish. And yet, there was no dog. She hadn’t known he had a dog.
Odd that the dog wasn’t here while her master was out and about, and also a piece of good luck. If the dog had been home, it might have barked when she came in, alerting the folks in the adjoining café.
There was no dog cage. Just a nice fluffy dog bed in the corner. Nicer than the bed she’d slept in as a girl. Austin treated his dog better than her foster parents had treated her.
Scanning the room, her eyes stopped on a little plaque.
Every single second,
Of every single day,
Every victim deserves my best.
She pulled a big pasta pot out of the cupboard, filled it with water, and set it on the stove. With a rag from the counter, she polished the sides where it was tarnished.
It needed to shine.
In a hoarse whisper, she read the plaque aloud, “Every single second, of every single day, every victim deserves my best.”
She couldn’t agree more.
