Chapter 47
CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN
A little after noon on Christmas Day, Austin walked into Jimmy’s hospital room carrying a brown paper sack.
Jimmy pushed himself up by his elbows and offered a faint smile.
“Brought you lunch,” Austin said. He pulled out a foil-wrapped burger. “Recipe I’ve been working on in the café. Already sold eight of them.”
Jimmy raised an eyebrow. “Eight doesn’t sound like a lot.”
Austin chuckled. “What’d you expect, ‘billions and billions served’? It’s got bacon and roasted green chiles. Tomato jam adds a kind of sweet and sour thing.”
Jimmy slowly opened up the foil. He moved deliberately, like a man in pain who would have to re-learn some of the basic motions of being a person. “Tomato jam?”
“Think of it as fancy ketchup.”
“Missed the gym the last couple days,” Jimmy said, inspecting the bun. “Not sure about the carbs.”
Austin laughed. “That bun might bring you all the way up to six percent body fat.” He pulled out a paper soda cup. “It’s Bud. On draft.” He handed it to Jimmy. “Usually it would go against my principles to serve a man a beer with a straw in it, but it was the only way to get it past the nurses. Drink it, and eat the damn bun.”
Jimmy took a sip and smiled. “Nothing has ever tasted so good.”
“Brought it over in an insulated bag to keep it cold.”
“Thanks.” He set the burger back in the foil on his lap. “I’ll get to this later. Pain meds are killing my appetite.”
Austin sat on a chair beside the bed. “You heard?”
Jimmy nodded. “Ridley and Lucy were here with Sheriff Daniels. Ridley got a call and I think they all went to get coffee or something.”
“They told you about Mary Bonner?”
He nodded.
“And Joshua?”
Jimmy dropped his head. “I was within ten feet of him. Can’t believe I let her get the jump on me.”
“Not your fault. Could have happened to anyone.” He nodded down to his shoulder. “They tell you she got the drop on me, too?”
Jimmy nodded. “Lady wasn’t bad with a knife.”
“I got lucky. I’d been stabbed like you, she’d have gotten away. And if you hadn’t made that call, we might not have gotten her.”
Jimmy sucked the beer through the straw. “I…”
“What?”
“How’d you come back from it?” Jimmy asked. “From the shooting in New York?”
“I didn’t. I tried, but I never really made it back. Why do you think I moved three thousand miles away and started making burgers and selling bait?”
“If you’d stayed with it, think you would have made it all the way back?”
Austin had thought about this almost every day since leaving the NYPD, and he honestly didn’t know the answer. “If it had just been me getting shot, yeah. I would have. I can take a punch. Most punches. But it was Fiona. And we never caught the guys who did it.”
“What’s the status of the case?”
“Colder than that Budweiser. Black Escalade left the scene. No plates. Witness saw three shooters. That’s it.”
“You saw nothing?”
Austin shook his head. “I got hit first, bullet spun me around. Dove in front of her with my back to the shooters. Next bullet got me in the shoulder blade. I fell. They think someone jumped out of the Escalade and shot her in the head. One bullet. An execution. Shot me in the back and leg on his way back to the car.”
Jimmy was silent a long time, then sipped his beer. “You think you’d feel better if it was solved?”
“Would I feel good? Or healed? No, that’ll never happen. But better? A little better? Yeah. I know I would.”
Jimmy drained the rest of the beer in a long pull on the straw. “You got any Guinness? I’m more of a dark beer guy.”
Austin laughed. “One beer maximum here.” He stood and walked to the window, looking at the city and the mountains in the distance. “You want some free advice?”
“I feel like I need it.”
“You’re alive. No one you loved died. You get to work with a woman who’s crazy about you.”
“Lucy?”
Austin nodded.
“She told you that?”
“Not in so many words, but, well. Let me put it this way: you two are as good at hiding your feelings as I am at ballroom dancing.”
“Wait, so…”
“Very bad.”
Jimmy laughed. “She hasn’t come to visit me alone yet.”
“She’s trying to be a pro. Give it time.”
The door creaked open behind him. “If it isn’t our New York cowboy.”
Austin turned. “Sheriff Daniels, I—”
Daniels extended a hand. “No shit. Thanks, Austin.”
They shook hands as Lucy and Ridley walked in.
Daniels said, “Austin. Look. As much as this pains me to say, you did a good job. Ridley filled me in.”
“And you kept the FBI out of the way long enough for us to get this done,” Austin said, accepting the olive branch and offering his own. “Thanks for that. Six pack and a bucket of bait on me next time you’re fishing in Hansville.”
Daniels smiled. “I’ll let Ridley fill you in on everything else. I’ve got an interview.”
“TV!” Lucy said. “It’s not often Seattle TV comes over here.”
Jimmy said, “Was wondering why you were dressed so well, Sheriff.”
Austin had barely noticed, but Daniels wore a nice blue suit and looked more put together than Austin had ever seen him.
Daniels brushed imaginary dust off his lapel. “When I win re-election, maybe I can get our budget increased enough to bring this guy in for good.” He gestured at Austin.
“What?” Austin asked.
Daniels glanced at his watch. “Like I said, Ridley will fill you in.” He gave Jimmy a thumbs up and strolled out of the room.
“What was that about?” Austin asked.
Lucy offered him a strange smile.
Ridley said, “Tell you in a sec, but first, good news: just got off the phone with the Seattle DA. They’re gonna want everything that ties into the D’Antonia prosecution. For now, her confession stands and she’ll stay in prison. I got her word: The Holiday Baby Bu—” He glanced at Austin. “Lorraine D’Antonia will never see the light of day. If her confession is eventually thrown out, she’ll be given a one way ticket to Rikers Island five minutes later.”
That was good news. Austin hadn’t been back to New York since the move, but he’d happily fly back to testify against her if the Sonya Lopez murder ever came to trial. “So what was Daniels talking about?”
“That’s what we were talking about down in the coffee shop,” Lucy said. She looked at Ridley. “Can I tell him?”
Ridley nodded.
“Daniels okay’ed three-grand a month stipend. To bring you on part time.”
“Bring me on to what?” Austin asked.
“The force,” Ridley said. “As a consultant on retainer. As-needed basis. The county is growing fast. Tax base is growing fast. More people means more crime. But it also means bigger budgets. Daniels said I could bring you on board.”
“Like Batman,” Jimmy said. “We get a tough case and we throw up the bat signal and you roll out from the little kitchen in Hansville.”
Austin laughed, shaking his head. “No way. That was more than enough action for me. Plus, my truck isn’t nearly as fast as the Batmobile.”
“Will you think about it?” Ridley asked. “No regular hours. You could still run the café—”
“And restaurant and bait shop,” Lucy added. “You’d need to get a PI license, and something about insurance. But Daniels said he could get it into the budget.”
Austin walked a slow lap around the hospital room. He could feel the eyes of the three others on him. “What made Daniels turn around on me?”
“Couple things,” Ridley said. “First, you helped solve this thing. Believe it or not, he actually does give a shit. And not just about his reelection, which he’s going to win in a landslide.”
“And you got him on TV,” Lucy added. “He cares more about that than anything.”
“Good news is,” Jimmy added. “If he gets famous enough, maybe he’ll run for governor and leave the department to Ridley.”
“Then we’d all owe you a debt of gratitude,” Lucy said.
They all shared a long laugh and the room fell into an awkward silence.
“So, how ‘bout it?” Ridley asked. “You want to join the squad?”
Austin walked to the doorway. “I need to get back to Run and take her for a walk on the beach. It’s the closest thing I have to an annual Christmas Day tradition. This’ll be the second Christmas I’ve done it. On the offer, I don’t know. Gimme a week to think about it.”
He gave Jimmy and the others one last look and strolled out of the hospital for what he hoped was the last time for a long, long time.
