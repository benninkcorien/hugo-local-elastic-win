A Note From the Author
A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR
Thanks for reading!
Thomas Austin and I have three things in common. First, we both live in a small beach town not far from Seattle. Second, we both like to cook. And third, we both spend more time than we should talking to our corgis.
If you enjoyed The Bones at Point No Point, I encourage you to check out the whole series of Thomas Austin novels online. Each book can be read as a standalone, although relationships and situations develop from book to book, so they will be more enjoyable if read in order.
In the digital world, authors rely more than ever on mysterious algorithms to spread the word about our books. One thing I know for sure is that ratings and reviews help. So, if you’d take the time to offer a quick rating of this book, I’d be very grateful.
If you enjoy pictures of corgis, the beautiful Pacific Northwest beaches, or the famous Point No Point lighthouse, consider joining my VIP Readers Club. When you join, you’ll receive no spam and you’ll be the first to hear about free and discounted eBooks, author events, and new releases.
Thanks for reading!
