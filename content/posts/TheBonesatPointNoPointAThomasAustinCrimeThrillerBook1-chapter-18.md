Chapter 17
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“What in the ever-loving-hellfire did you guys do?” Sheriff Daniels stood as they walked in, waving his hands as though swiping spiderwebs from a doorway.
Austin was careful to stay a step behind Ridley. When Ridley sat, he took the chair next to him.
Daniels stood, mouth agape, then slowly sat, eyes shifting between Austin and Ridley.
Ridley said, “I’m not sure what you mean, Sheriff.”
“I got calls from two different business owners in Kingston saying there was some kind of chase scene happening? And you didn’t catch the suspect?”
“I can address that,” Austin said. He’d known tough guys. Truly tough guys. Sheriff Daniels was a bully, an insecure man who had failed upward and had to compensate for the fact that he was the dumbest guy in the room by lording his position over everyone else. He’d served under a guy like this once before, and he’d learned that the best way to deal with them was cordially, but without apology. Like it or not, Daniels could kick him off the case, and Austin didn’t want that to happen.
“I’ll get to you in a minute, but first…” he slid a printout across the table to Ridley.
Austin leaned over to read it with him. It was an article from the Kitsap Union by Anna Downey. The headline read: Possible Connections Seen Between Recent Abductions.
Daniels crinkled a paper loudly. He had his own copy. “I’ll tell you what it says.” His voice was an angry staccato, like he was biting off the last ten percent of each word. “Despite police assurances that no connection has yet been found between the recent kidnappings in Kitsap County—the first of which ended in the tragic death of Allie Shreever—the Union has learned that both babies were born in the birthing center of St. Michael’s medical, and only two weeks apart. Further, the Union has learned that two nurses, both of whom may have been present during shifts that overlapped with the victims, have gone missing in recent days.”
“Wait, wait, wait,” Ridley said. “They missed shifts. They haven’t ‘gone missing.’”
Daniels slammed the paper down on the table. “How is it that I’m hearing about this in a local paper from a reporter who works part time, and not from my lead detective on this case?”
Ridley let out a long, slow breath. “Look. I was at the hospital, questioning the administrative staff and acquiring surveillance video when we located our prime suspect. I’ll be following up right after this meeting.”
Daniels and Ridley stared at one another silently for a little longer than necessary.
“Fine,” Daniels said at last, turning to Austin. “Didn’t I tell you, no cowboy shit?”
As flatly as he could manage, Austin said, “I’ve never ridden a horse, sir.”
Ridley laughed, but Daniels was having none of it. “I told you to play by the rules, you signed paperwork saying you wouldn’t put yourself in danger. If you get yourself killed, do you know how that would make me look?”
Austin held his gaze. Daniels’ eyes were wet and bloodshot, like he’d been up all night drinking. “It’s nice to know I’m cared for.”
“Your New York sarcasm won’t play here, Austin. I’ve half a mind to terminate your contract.”
“I need him,” Ridley said quickly.
As much as Austin wanted to tell Daniels to go to hell, he wanted to see this thing through to its conclusion. Even more than that, he owed it to Ridley, Lucy and Jimmy. They were in this together now.
Austin tried to sound conciliatory. “Sheriff Daniels, look.” He held up both hands in an I-Surrender gesture. “I saw the suspect and made a spur-of-the-moment call to pursue her. I called it in to Detective O’Rourke immediately, and at no time was I in danger.”
“You got run over.”
Austin patted his hip. “It’s a scratch.” He thought for a moment, then made his tone so soft it likely came off as patronizing. “I will try to be safe. I will play by the rules. But there’s something you should know about me, Sheriff Daniels.”
Daniels was fidgeting with a snow globe paperweight on his desk. “And what’s that, New York?”
Austin stood and waited until Daniels looked up. He leaned in, meeting his eyes. “If I have the chance to pursue a suspect I believe to be a baby-murdering psychopath, the rules go out the window. When lives are in danger, I make the rules.”
Daniels stood, pointing a finger at Austin’s chest. “You’re an arrogant prick.”
“Maybe,” Austin said. “But that’s how I do things. If that doesn’t work for you, then I’ll see myself out. I’ve got a café to run. And general store. And bait shop.”
He glanced at Ridley, then returned his gaze to Daniels, who seemed to be thinking. Austin was betting he’d cave, as bullies usually did when confronted.
Daniels sat heavily. “You can stay on. For now. Ridley, keep your New York cowboy in line, okay?”
Ridley nodded, stood, and moved to the door. “Before I forget, chief, can you get your FBI contacts to lean on an app called TaskRabbit? We’re looking for a list of tasks, with details, performed by Trisha Simone in the last three months.”
“I will,” Daniels said. “But it’ll just give them more reason to box us out. I was gonna tell you, FBI Task Force from the D’Antonia case, combined with a unit from the Seattle PD and—” he jerked a thumb in Austin’s direction—“even one of his old colleagues from the NYPD, they’re meeting tomorrow. Secure video call.”
“What for?” Ridley asked.
“Discuss the case. FBI is helping us out with forensics on the Green house. Nothing so far. They assured me they won’t swoop in, but if we don’t get something soon, I can’t justify keeping this thing local. I don’t think I need to tell you, Rid, this is the one. For me, for you, for our department. You may think I’m an asshole, but we can both agree that the next forty-eight hours will make or break our little cop shop here.”
Ridley swallowed hard. “Heard, boss.”
Even Austin had to agree. Daniels was a bastard to be sure, but he wanted this thing solved as much as anyone, even if it was only out of self-interest. The case was already getting national attention, and now that Anna Downey had raised the possibility of a connection between the two kidnappings, that would increase. And if someone leaked details about how the bones had been found—the Thanksgiving gift bag—then the entire national media would descend on Kitsap County.
Austin paused at the door. “Heard, Sheriff Daniels. Don’t worry. Keep the FBI off our backs for another day or two and I promise we’ll find Joshua.”
