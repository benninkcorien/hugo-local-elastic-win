Chapter 34
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
Jimmy stepped back and swung his size-twelve boot toward the door with a violent thrust. The heel struck just under the doorknob, cracking the frame but not breaking the door all the way open.
Leaping back, then lunging forward shoulder first, he crashed through the door, landing on a linoleum floor. He leapt up, eyes darting around the small, dark room. He smelled the sweet, buttery aroma of sugar cookies. The only light spilled in through the broken door, a soft gray glow revealing a little stove and a kitchen table. A few papers were scattered on the table, plus a notebook and…
Despite the cold, perspiration broke out on his forehead. Next to the notebook was a red and white Christmas gift bag.
Through the door next to the stove was a sofa, probably the living room. “Anyone there?” he shouted, pulling his firearm. “Police. Identify yourself.”
Eyes on the door to the living room, he called again. “Kitsap County police. If anyone is here, get on the ground, arms and legs spread out.”
Everything was silent. Had he imagined the sounds? Maybe they’d been here and left in another car. The wind had been racing through the trees, howling in its own way. Perhaps his ears had been playing tricks on him.
Eyes still on the door, he reached for the Christmas bag with his free hand. It appeared to be empty. Next to it, a folder caught his eye for half a second. It was labeled Johnson Hill Orphanage. The same orphanage that had handled the Lorraine D’Antonia adoption.
A sharp, pained cry erupted from the living room.
Then a muffled shout.
A baby’s squeal.
“Kitsap County police. I will shoot you. Get on the ground, arms and legs spread out, and you will make it out of here alive.”
He stepped slowly across the kitchen. Reaching the doorway, he peered into the living room. A blonde woman was tied to a chair on the far end. Anna Downey. He watched her eyes dart to her left, his right.
He turned, but it was too late.
The chef’s knife was halfway into his belly by the time he looked up into the cold, vacant eyes of The Holiday Baby Butcher.
