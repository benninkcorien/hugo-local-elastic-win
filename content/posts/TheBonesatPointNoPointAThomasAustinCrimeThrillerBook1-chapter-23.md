Chapter 22
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Face down on the walkway, Austin kept his eyes closed even after he’d regained consciousness. How the hell had he gotten himself into this? Yesterday morning he’d been in his kitchen, trying to make the perfect hamburger. Now he was lying face down on a sticky walkway, blood running down his cheek, surrounded by potting soil, flecks of Mexican rice and chicken, and broken shards of a pot that had left a gash in his head.
He slowly opened one eye. The blow had spun him around so he was facing the railing, where he could see down into the parking lot. Despite the sharp pain in his head, he cracked an involuntary smile when he saw Lucy pressing Trisha Simone face first into her cruiser. The smile disappeared just as fast as he took a deep breath. Cat piss, ammonia. Then he remembered Frank Baxter.
Leaping up like a dead man coming back to life, Austin spun on Baxter, who stood in the doorway holding a small piece of the pot he’d broken over Austin’s head. The look on his face told Austin that not only was Baxter not a threat, he was re-thinking every life decision that had brought him to this point. An hour ago he’d been anticipating a lovely burrito, probably a joint and a beer, maybe a movie. Now his “girlfriend” was under arrest and he’d just assaulted a man who had six inches and fifty pounds on him.
Austin wiped blood from his cheek with the back of his hand, then raised his fists, poised to strike. “You’re having a very bad day, Baxter.”
For half a second, Baxter raised his fists, a tough-guy look painted across his face like he’d just watched Raging Bull.
It only took the slightest movement—Austin cocking his right hand back two inches—for Baxter to fold. In one motion, he threw his hands straight up and allowed his legs to collapse out from beneath him, dropping into a cross-legged posture on the ground, arms to the sky. Austin thought it looked like the most ridiculous yoga posture he’d ever seen. He decided to call it The Surrendering Loser pose.
Austin showed the back of his hand to Baxter. “See the blood? Like I said, this is a very bad day for you.”
“I swear I don’t know anything.”
“Why’d you hit me with a pot?”
Baxter hung his head. “I’m a frigging idiot. I saw Trisha, thought she was in trouble.” He closed his eyes tight, as though pinching his face into a ball of remorse could somehow get him out of this situation. “I swear to God I’ve never done anything like that.”
In general, Austin wasn’t a vengeful guy. As much as he wanted justice for victims, as much as he wanted genuinely bad guys off the streets, he was quick to forgive when someone wronged him personally. With one exception, he didn’t seek out vengeance. If he ever got twenty-minutes alone in a room with the men who’d killed Fiona, well, that would be different. Very different. But Frank Baxter? Austin had always had a soft spot for guys like Frank Baxter. A sort of there-but-for-the-grace kind of pity. Without knowing any of the details of this man’s life, he knew it hadn’t been easy. And if he was reading Baxter right, he wasn’t involved in any of Trisha’s schemes.
Austin loomed over him. “In a minute or two you’ll be in the back of that police car.” He pointed down to the parking lot. “I’ll make you a deal. When we get back to the office and I ask you questions, tell me the exact truth, the whole truth, the first time I ask you a question. If you do…” he pointed at the gash in his head… “we’ll forget about this. You could be home by late tonight, maybe even in time to order another burrito.” He squatted, meeting Baxter’s flighty eyes. “If you don’t, we’re gonna have to assume that you’re involved in Trisha’s dealing.” He held a shard of the broken pot right in front of Baxter’s eyes. “And I’m gonna have to tell the detectives down there about your assault with a deadly weapon.”

Ridley had agreed to let Austin take the lead in the interview, hoping his knowledge of the D’Antonia case would allow him to twist the questions in the right direction. But first he’d forced Austin to take care of his head. There was no way he was going to the hospital and risk missing the interrogation, so after popping a couple aspirin with another cup of lukewarm coffee, he’d used the mirror in the men’s room to clean up and apply pressure to the wound with a neatly folded paper towel.
The interview room was an eight-by-eight box in the back corner of the building. It had been painted a thin white, like nonfat milk, as though someone had thrown on primer then forgotten to finish the job with a coat of interior paint.
Austin sat in a plastic chair across from Trisha. Ridley leaned on the wall.
Trisha sat in a ratty old loveseat in the corner, her chin poking out above a thin blanket she’d pulled up around her neck.
Across the hall, Jimmy and Lucy were in an identical room with Frank Baxter. Though all agreed that he seemed to be a passenger on Trisha’s bus of criminality, she’d probably let details slip in the past. Loose pillow talk, Austin knew, had brought down as many criminals as forensic science.
“Trisha,” Ridley began, “this conversation is being recorded.” He pointed to a small camera pointing down from the corner.
She nodded.
He read her the standard Miranda rights and she nodded along, only acknowledging them verbally when Ridley asked twice. Thankfully, she did not request a lawyer, which would have ended their conversation before it began.
When he’d finished with the preliminaries, Ridley leaned back in his chair and laced his hands behind his head. “Thomas Austin is a consultant on this case. He’s going to ask you a few questions.”
She glanced in Austin’s direction, then continued to stare blankly ahead. “You were at my apartment. My truck.”
“I was.”
She opened her mouth right away, then thought better of whatever she was about to say. Finally, she said, “I’ve never been arrested.” Her voice was weak, kind of raspy. She sounded tired.
Austin handed her a photograph. “Where’s this little boy? Where’s Joshua Green?”
She looked down for only a moment. “No idea. Never heard of him.”
Austin held his head stone still. He’d learned that a total absence of movement was sometimes a better way to get someone’s attention than a gesture, because it was unexpected. When Trisha looked over, Austin said, “I promise you, we can be here for a long, long time. You can go to jail for a long, long time. But everything in your life will end up better if you tell me right now everything you know about this boy.”
She looked at the photo again, her lip quivering slightly. “ I swear I don’t know about that child.”
Austin almost smiled. “Interesting phrasing. So you know about a child?”
“That’s not what I said, not what I meant.”
“Why’d you say that child’?”
“I didn’t.”
Austin made a quick pivot. “When was the last time you were in Hansville?”
She let her eyes wander up and to the left. “I don’t know. Few months ago maybe.”
“Then why do we have video of your truck entering Hansville three weeks ago?”
“Damn.”
“Yeah,” Ridley said angrily, “damn is right.”
“Why were you in Hansville?” Austin demanded.
“I wasn’t. Maybe someone stole my truck.”
“And then brought it back and parked it in your spot? Without you noticing? That would be remarkable.” Austin pulled out a fresh paper towel from his pocket and blotted his wound. He felt an overwhelming sense of urgency to get everything out of her as fast as he could, but his read on Trisha was that an aggressive approach would just make her clam up, possibly demand a lawyer. “Trisha, you might want to accept the fact that Detective Calvin and I are both pretty good at this. And, no disrespect, you’re one of the worst liars I’ve ever interviewed. How about you tell us where Joshua is?”
Suddenly she stamped her feet like a toddler. “Did you hit your head or something? I told you I’ve never heard of that kid.”
“There it is again,” Ridley said. “‘That kid.’ There something you want to tell us?”
She folded her arms.
“When was the last time you were on Bainbridge Island?” Austin asked.
She shrugged.
“Do you wear size eight shoes?”
“Yeah, sometimes seven and a half, but yeah. So what?”
Austin reached down and swiped the blanket away from her feet. Adidas, same as the ones they’d pulled from her apartment. “When the FBI compares these–or the pair we found in your apartment—to the size eight imprint next to that little boy's crib, what do you think they’ll find?”
“I work out a lot,” Trisha said. “I have a lot of shoes.”
Austin turned to Ridley. “The FBI, I’ve heard they’re pretty good at fingerprints, shoe prints, that kind of thing. You heard that?”
“If that shoe was in Joshua’s room, we’ll know by tomorrow morning. And if it was,” he paused, shaking his head as Trisha stared at him, “that’s the ballgame. Life in prison.”
Ridley handed her a photograph of the Thanksgiving gift bag Sarah and Benny had found on the beach. “Recognize that?”
Trisha was trying to hold her face tight, but Austin noticed the slightest twitch around her eyes. “It’s a bag, a Thanksgiving bag.”
“And what’s in it?” Austin asked.
“No idea.”
Austin handed her another photo. The close-up inside the bag. The bones. The skull.
She stared blankly. “Bones?”
“Right again,” Austin said. He handed her another photo. A picture of Allie Shreever. “Her bones.”
Trisha looked back and forth between the photo of the bones and the photo of Allie Shreever. Her face trembled slightly. “Oh, God.”
Her shock appeared real, but that didn’t mean much. Some types of killers were so deranged they could convince themselves they hadn’t done it, so proof of their actions often evoked genuine surprise.
Austin pointed at the picture of Allie Shreever. “That’s right. Her bones. I worked in New York City for a long time. I saw a lot of horrible things. Things that would make your skin crawl. Things that would haunt you.” He tapped the photo of the bag of bones. “This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. And you did it.” His tone was still relatively cool, relatively neutral.
She dropped the photos on her lap. She stared into Austin’s eyes, her voice a whisper. “I swear I didn’t kill her.”
There was a quick knock at the door and Lucy poked her head in. “Boss, Austin, can we grab you a sec?”
Austin held Trisha’s stare for a moment more, then followed Ridley into the hall, where Jimmy joined them from the other interview room.
“We’re nowhere with Frank Baxter,” Jimmy said. “Either because he’s actually got nothing to do with Trisha besides giving her the—”
Lucy held a hand in front of his mouth. “Don’t say it.”
Jimmy brushed her hand aside. “The secret sauce. Or because he’s a damn good liar.”
“He’s not a good liar,” Austin said.
“All he has is the weed dealing. Says she buys in bulk from a guy in Seattle, then breaks it into twenty sacks and sells it to high schoolers. I believe he doesn’t know much more than that.”
Ridley nodded. “Trisha was definitely involved with Allie Shreever. Still saying she doesn’t know where Joshua is. Lucy and Jimmy, keep pressing Baxter. Anything about Hansville, anything strange she’s said about babies. Anything. Austin, what’s your read on her?”
Before he could answer, Samantha appeared, walking down the hallway briskly and carrying a silver laptop. “I’ve got something. Something huge.”
She turned the laptop around so they could see the screen, then held forth like a college professor. “Trisha erased her search history, but pieces of it were still cached. Look.”
It was a screenshot of a Google search history. Trisha had run searches for “The Holiday Baby Butcher,” “Seattle baby murders,” and “baby bones in holiday sacks.”
Austin smiled. Evidence this damning didn’t often show up halfway through an interview. It was almost too good to be true.
Ridley patted Samantha on the back. “Nice work.”
Austin took the laptop and returned to the interview room. When Ridley joined him, he held it up like a proud parent showing off a newborn. “Recognize this?”
Trisha frowned. “That’s mine. You can’t just—”
“We can,” Ridley said, firmly. “We did.”
Austin sat, placing the computer where she could see the screen, see her own search history. “Look at the screen, then look at the pictures in your lap. Would you care to tell us anything about those two babies?”
“I didn’t do anything.”
Austin let out a long, slow, disappointed breath. “I’m trying to help you, Trisha.” It wasn’t a total lie, but it was pretty damn close. He was trying to help Joshua Green and his parents. It was too late to help Allie Shreever, but he was trying to help her parents. “Why did you run those searches? Telling the truth always feels better in the end.”
She stared at the screen for a long time, then closed the computer. “Screw you, Google.”
“Not a huge fan myself,” Austin said. “All those ads, right? Where’s Joshua?”
Trisha crossed her arms. “I don’t know who that is. I swear it.”
Ridley moved suddenly across the room and crouched to get right up in her face. “With those searches and the video of your truck, and the eyewitnesses putting you at the beach, we have you on the kidnapping and murder of Allie Shreever.” His voice had turned angry, even a touch maniacal, like he was doing a Samuel L. Jackson impression. “When that footprint comes back from the FBI, we have you on another kidnapping. I urge you in the strongest possible terms: stop lying.”
She looked at the floor, stacking and restacking the pictures in her lap. When she finally looked up, she had tears in her eyes. “Lawyer,” she said softly. “I want a lawyer.”
