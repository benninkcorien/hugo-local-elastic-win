Forensics: A Guide for Writers
FOREWORD 
BY MATT WITTEN  
Writing crime novels and TV shows is a lot of fun, but there are definitely occupational hazards. For one thing, you tend to have rather odd dreams. Also, your family can get a tad perturbed when you discuss serial killers or methods of strangulation at the dinner table. And last but not least, you can find yourself in the middle of writing a great murder mystery and suddenly realize you have no idea what the hell you’re talking about.
Reading Howdunit: Forensics may not cure your dreams or make you a more socially appropriate dinner partner, but it will definitely make you feel more knowledgeable. Even better, you’ll actually be more knowledgeable. This book covers all of the forensics basics, from DNA to gunshot residue to associated legal issues, in a comprehensive way.
Not only that, this book is extremely readable with highly entertaining anecdotes. In fact, my biggest problem with the book is that when I was reading it, my wife kept sneaking it away from me so she could read it. And she’s not even into this stuff.
In my work on Law & Order, Women’s Murder Club, and other crime shows, I have consulted a lot of experts and read a lot of reference books. I have found that most scientists don’t think like crime writers. Doug Lyle actually does, no doubt because he’s been helping crime writers for over a decade and has answered hundreds upon hundreds of our questions. Howdunit: Forensics is absolutely the best reference for crime writers I have ever seen.
Best of all, you will probably find that reading this book inspires you to think up new ideas for murder mysteries and plot twists. In fact, I’m thinking of a way to work Lyle’s story about “The Shark Arm Murder” into my next TV episode. Maybe I’ll try it out on my family at dinner.
MATT WITTEN has written for several television crime shows including Law & Order, CSI: Miami, Women’s Murder Club, and Homicide. He also wrote the Jacob Burns mystery novels for Signet.
