A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE MALE MESSIAH
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two archetypes get along well if the Male Messiah is on a spiritual mission and if the Recluse is not jealous of the status bestowed upon the Male Messiah.
The Recluse can help the Male Messiah navigate the paranormal terrain he is operating in if his quest is spiritual, or he can help the Male Messiah hide out if that is what the messiah needs. The Recluse is highly skilled at evading others.
The Male Messiah can call into question all of the Recluse’s beliefs, setting him off balance.
