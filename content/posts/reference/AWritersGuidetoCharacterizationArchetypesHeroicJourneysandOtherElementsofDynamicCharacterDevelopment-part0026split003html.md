A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON
The kind of change the hero will have to endure means change to the hundredth power. Most people avoid change to begin with, and this kind of change is not usually pleasant at all. The hero will face some very intense stuff. It can be an inner trauma in which she faces personal issues or it can be a situation where outward events come at her. Either way, it is an extreme, traumatic event that is going to take place.
Most people resist this kind of change. If the character is very well balanced and has been through something like it before, it won’t seem harsh at first. Many CIA agents who have been captured in the past may not think that being captured again is a huge deal. In anyone else’s opinion, however, it is an extreme situation. The heroine can see it as a challenge or a transformation rather than a complete ‘why me’ pity episode, if she chooses to do so.
