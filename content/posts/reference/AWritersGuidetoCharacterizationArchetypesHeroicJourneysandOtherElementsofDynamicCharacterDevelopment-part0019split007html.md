A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can use symbols of inventors and of inventiveness. Items that symbolize cleverness and a creative intelligence. You can have your hero make connections that are odd. An apple and an orange placed in a bowl can symbolize something like this. In the hero’s home the decorations could seem a little off. His way of dressing might be a little odd. His friends may be eccentric.
You could have an unconventional character around to show inventive, clever thinking. The love interest could be exotic and flamboyant, or just the opposite.
The villain can be the predator that the hero is trying to get away from. The hero has no choice but to get clever and inventive because he can’t go head to head with the villain for whatever reason. The villain might be some kind of natural disaster such as a tornado or flooding.
