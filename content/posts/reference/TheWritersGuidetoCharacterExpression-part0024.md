SHALLOW: WARMTH
SHALLOW: WARMTH
Quote: “You might be an amateur if you rely too heavily on clichés. This item is obligatory for any writing handbook. Beware the automatic phrase, such as “white as snow” and “quiet as a mouse.” If your heroic character roars like a lion, she’d better be a lioness.”—author, James V. Smith, Jr.
It is bland and cliché to state that it was a hot day or that the character felt warm. Body temperature can fluctuate depending on the circumstances and the setting, so writers should use Deep POV to describe the sensation or the warmer climate.
Whether a writer is describing the weather, or how something feels to the touch, or if a character feels warm, the more detailed the descriptions are, the better your storytelling skills will become. A number of different things can cause a person to become warm such as, anxiety, nervousness, weather, embarrassment, and illness.
Certain types of genres require varied levels of detail when establishing the setting and world-building. For example, a high-fantasy, historical adventure, or a science fiction novel will have an observant readership that expects not only graphic details and powerful imaginary regarding the setting, but facts and accuracy, too. One way to convey the weather or depict the setting is to have a character describe the background in his/her own “voice” through the five senses, rather than using an omniscient POV.
And I urge writers not to describe the setting with a cliché such as, “It was a dark and stormy night…” because settings can establish a distinct mood and atmosphere, like in a gothic novel with a mysterious castle, or a spaceship in a galaxy far, far away. Consider the setting not just as a factual location, but as a crucial part of a story’s ambiance and emotional impact.
Some physical signs of warmth might be:
Heavy sweating
A flushed or red appearance to the skin
Panting, gasping, or wheeziness
Slick-sweat hair
Feeling lethargic or drowsy
Heavy-eyed
Dizziness
Nausea or Vomiting
Thirsty
Examples of warm weather for settings:
Wilting flowers
Brown, dead grass
Cloudless sky
Bright, hot sun
Dry winds
Sizzling asphalt
Air-conditioned house
Condensation on glasses
Sunburned faces / bodies
Muggy heat
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: When I left the house and the sun felt hot.
DEEP POV: Outside, the sun warmed my skin.
SHALLOW: He felt hot under the desert sun.
DEEP POV: The blazing desert sun beat down on him like the fires of hell.
SHALLOW: My skin was too hot and it looked red like a sunburn.
DEEP POV: My skin turned a splotchy red and felt fiery to the touch
SHALLOW: She felt too warm, so she decided to go swimming in the pool.
DEEP POV: Her feverish skin cooled when she jumped into the swimming pool.
SHALLOW: The day was hot and sunny.
DEEP POV: The sun flared in the sky like a fiery ball.
SHALLOW: The summer weather was humid and hot.
DEEP POV: It was another torrid day. The brown lawns appeared shriveled and dry and the flowers wilted like sleepy children.
SHALLOW: The day was too hot and the sky looked very blue.
DEEP POV: The sun hotly glares down from a cloudless cobalt sky.
SHALLOW: I felt sweaty and thirsty.
DEEP POV: Sweat poured down my face and a deep thirst plagued my senses.
SHALLOW: She walked slowly in the heat to a fan.
DEEP POV: She moved sluggishly through the stifling air to the fan.
SHALLOW: The street looked really warm.
DEEP POV: Steam rose in blurry waves from the black-tarred streets.
SHALLOW: I looked up at the hot sun that was shining on the homes.
DEEP POV: I squinted at the blazing sun that violently shown down upon the houses.
SHALLOW: The dog looked hot and he was panting.
DEEP POV: The dog panted, its tongue hung down in an effort to stay cool.
SHALLOW: The sunny day felt scorching.
DEEP POV: The sun flared like a furnace with no gentle winds to relieve its fiery wrath.
SHALLOW: I heard the sound of insects buzzing in the heat.
DEEP POV: The buzz of the cicadas emanated their somber drone of summer’s blistering oppression.
Here are two more examples of shallow writing and revising with a Deeper POV. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the shallower writing, but see if you can clearly identify it now that you’re more aware of showing vs. telling.)
Please closely examine these two short scenes…
SHALLOW: 
It was a very hot day in August. Everyone felt warm and looked miserable. I noticed that no one moved or wanted to go outside. It was too hot to do much of anything. Even the animals did not like the heat.
I stood at the front window and looked outside as I placed my face against the window. The glass felt cold to touch because my mom had the air-conditioner turned on. The street appeared hot outside, too.
DEEP POV: 
Everything appeared to melt from the heat of the sweltering August sun, and even the sizzling asphalt resembled black liquid in the blaze of the afternoon glare. Heat waves were modulating off the pavement, just like I imagined the streets of Hell.
Nothing stirred. Not even the birds, squirrels, or dogs.
Sweat glistened on my skin and I pressed my warm face against the cool, perspiring glass of the living room window. Thank goodness, my mom had cranked up the air-conditioning.
***
Whenever possible, be specific in your descriptions. Use vivid metaphors and similes to create dazzling images. For example, offer vibrant, colorful details by describing the heat of the sun, and then how it affects the character’s senses in a scene that features warmer weather.
