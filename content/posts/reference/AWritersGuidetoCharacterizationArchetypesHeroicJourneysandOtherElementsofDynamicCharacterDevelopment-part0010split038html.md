A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
EMOTION VS. MENTAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. These skills are right up the Father’s Daughter’s alley. She values men herself and she is used to being around responsible men.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. The Woman’s Man can help her with all these things. He lives a natural life, helps women loosen up and find themselves, and he values women. They can bring each other self-esteem and romance.
She is not very comfortable around him at first. He has a hard time understanding all of the intellectual jargon she uses, and he wonders if she is trying to impress him or make him feel stupid. She can be a good balance for him, but they will have a tough time making things work if she’s too stubborn and unwilling to change. She’s attracted to powerful men, and he isn’t one. She may be too mentally focused for his taste, but he enjoys a ‘project.’
She likes being the only woman in a man’s life and he may have way too many female friends for her liking.
