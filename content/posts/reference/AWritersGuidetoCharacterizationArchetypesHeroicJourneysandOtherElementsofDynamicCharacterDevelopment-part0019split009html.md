A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
We enjoy watching people use their creative wits to get out of bad situations. For instance, the character MacGyver time and time again uses scientific prowess to save the day. The key is to make a clever solution plausible—it must seem possible or the audience will not root for the hero.
Keep in mind that the hero must use the materials he finds in his setting to put together a solution. Therefore, the setting is very important in this case. You must know the story’s outcome in advance so you can go back and plant the objects and ideas the hero needs in order to work a clever way out. Make his solution feasible: The reader should remember having seen certain objects in the setting when they are used later on. This fosters reader participation, which makes the story more enjoyable.
