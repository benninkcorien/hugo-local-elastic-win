A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE WOMAN’S MAN
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two archetypes are opposites in every way. The Woman’s Man loves to be spontaneous and hates structure and rules. He can be very emotional. He is in touch with his body.
This is directly opposed to the Businessman and his way of life. He’s in touch with his mind and does things by the book. He is all for the team and doesn’t want to be the center of attention. He can be very out of touch with his emotions and may see the Woman’s Man as weak and inefficient.
At the same time the Businessman is very left-brained and smart. He often solves the problems the Woman’s Man creates.
The Woman’s Man can teach the Businessman to get in touch with his feelings. The Businessman can teach the Woman’s Man how to get along in the world and provide for himself in a left-brained, logical world.
