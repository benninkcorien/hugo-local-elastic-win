A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
SEX AND LOVE
When it comes to sex, you must decide how intimate your hero and heroine will be with each other and how often they will be together. If they won’t be together until the end, you have to plan enough obstacles to keep them apart throughout the story.
With love, you have to decide if your hero will be in touch with his feelings or not. If he will be able to express his feelings to the heroine, at what point in the story does this happen?
When writing romance you need to decide what your philosophy is. What are the moral standards you live by? Or do you want to write sex scenes that border on erotica? Think about it and make a decision so you can feel more comfortable as you write.
   •  What belongs in the forbidden zone to you?
   •  What would you never do with a man or woman you just met? Or a man or woman you’ve known for thirty years?
   •  Do you think sex can ever be Divine?
   •  Can your characters make love with words instead of deeds?
   •  Do your characters have to be married before they can be intimate? What time period are you writing in?
   •  Will the heroine be aggressive like the Seductive Muse may be? Or uncomfortable like the Matriarch may be?
   •  Will the hero prefer physical contact right away like the Protector might? Or will he like to look at the heroine for hours like the Artist might?
When you are developing your idea and outlining your story, think about how many sex scenes your book will have. Instead of jumping into a sex scene right away, start off with more sensual scenes and gradually get ‘steamier’ as the story moves along.
Once you’re naked, you’re naked. Savor the moments between your lovers. Stop and take a good look at your intimate scenes.
   •  Have you thought about the desires of your hero and heroine?
   •  What details are you missing?
   •  What small gestures can be a source of sensuality? Think of the details. Which is better? “A man puts his arm around a woman?” OR “A masculine hand caresses the small curve of a woman’s back?”
Consider writing your loves scenes using all the senses. When writing a love scene, you must not only think about setting and character arcs, you must remember to use all the senses especially as they apply to the setting.
It’s very simple, really, just take a look at the location of your love scene and examine it from the perspective of the senses.
   •  Seeing
   •  Smelling
