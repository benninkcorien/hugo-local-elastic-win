EMOTION: GUILT
EMOTION: GUILT
Quote: “Usually, we combine internal and external conflicts for a richer story. That means we have to understand how our characters approach and resolve conflict.” —novelist and blogger, Jami Gold
Guilt and shame can be great motivators for a character’s actions and reactions. It can cause a lot of conflict within the storyline if guilt makes a character withdraw from their friends and family. Shame can even cause a character to lie about their past, or hide an ugly truth. These emotions can even cause a character to be in serious denial over a situation or about another character. Usually a character who feels ashamed will lower their head and look downward to avoid direct eye contact.
Remorse and shame are often obsessive emotional traits or reactions that can weigh heavily on a person’s subconscious. While guilt might provoke a more positive response in a character, particularly when he/she is seeking to mend a broken relationship or correct a mistake, feelings of shame emphasizes what might be immoral or dishonest within themselves. Shame would have a much more inward focus for the character, and make them feel poorly about themselves, instead of just the actions they should’ve taken.
These emotions can become a character flaw that ties in with a theme, like redemption. For resolution, a character feeling guilty over something can overcome the fatal flaw through a heartfelt apology, or begging forgiveness, or by righting a wrong.
Some physical signs of guilt might be:
Avoid eye contact
Fidget when confronted
Flushed face
Angry outbursts / Defensive remarks
Rubbing the back of neck
Shoulders drawing up, elbows tucking into the sides
Becoming unnaturally quiet or still
A quivering chin
Hunched shoulders
Stuttering when talking
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I felt very guilty.
DEEP POV: A sting of warmth stirred within my heart.
SHALLOW: He was overwhelmed with guilt. (Cliché)
DEEP POV: His chin quivered. He had to tell her the truth.
SHALLOW: I was too ashamed to face him. (Cliché)
DEEP POV: I couldn’t look him in the eye.
SHALLOW: Elijah felt remorseful.
DEEP POV: Elijah’s face flushed as he tried to explain.
SHALLOW: I felt so much shame.
DEEP POV: My scalp prickled with heat and I turned away.
SHALLOW: She was repentant for her actions.
DEEP POV: She inwardly winced and wished she take those harsh words back.
SHALLOW: Shame engulfed me over what I’d done.
DEEP POV: Biting my lip, I hurried away with my head down.
SHALLOW: James felt regretful.
DEEP POV: He repeatedly swallowed, trying to find the right thing to say.

Here is an excerpt taken from my college romance novel, SMASH INTO YOU that depicts the emotion “shame” that makes the main character feel defensive and lie to hide her dark past. Please carefully examine this example…
DEEP POV:
“I just don’t like you like that.” I glanced away because this wasn’t just one of my many lies. This was a lie that hurt the both of us. “I think you’re a great guy, but you’re just not my type and I need to focus on my studies.”
“You’re lying. Again.”
My head snapped in his direction. “What? No, I’m not!”
“Please. Your eyes are darting all over the place and your words don’t match what’s coming out of your mouth.”
Damn. He was too perceptive.
“You don’t even know me, Cole. I meant what I said.”
“You’re just scared for some reason to explore whatever this is between us. Try being honest for once, Serena. I can tell you play a good game, but I can spot a liar from miles away, and you’re clearly hiding something. They say the truth will set you free.”
The truth. Who knew what that was anymore?
I wasn’t sure if I could tell anyone the truth. Lying had become a vicious circle. Once a person started, it was hard to stop without spinning out of control. So I did the only other thing I was good at besides being a master manipulator—running away…

Try to stay away from using descriptive adjectives like angry or happy or sad or guilt that tell the reader the specific emotions of the character, and instead revise to stay in a Deeper POV.
