A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
A hero would resist this kind of lesson because it’s his nature to want to get things done quickly. There is a reason, which can be found in his past, for why he is so compelled to get things done quickly, to rush into assumptions, to get into reactive mode, and therefore to make the wrong decisions and choices.
He may feel like he’s the boss and anything he says should be law. Why should he have to worry about controlling his emotions and passions? If he wants to move forward, he’s going to do what he wants to do when he wants to do it.
In general, it’s really hard to slow down; most people don’t want to slow down because when they exercise patience and do actually slow down, many of the reasons behind why they are so busy and frantic come to the surface. These reasons are things they don’t want to face or think about. So the busier they are and the faster they are moving through life, the less time they have to face these things.
Something in the character’s history makes him want to run away. That’s something you’ll need to figure out. What happened? What incident occurred when he was thirteen years old that is pushing this character and giving him such drive, even though that drive is causing him to make all kinds of mistakes and create his own conflict? This character does a really good job of creating the conflict more than any villain could.
