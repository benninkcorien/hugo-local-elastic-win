A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
This lesson is not taught very often because few people have the opportunity to fully stand in their power and question everything in life. It’s not only about having an abundance of money, however, because plenty of people seeking this type of greater understanding live in communities, communes, and monasteries, where the basic responsibilities are shared and needs are met without their having to spend time earning money for a living. Though their needs are not met with money, these individuals are able to engage in activism and exploration. Still, living in such a community may be hard for the hero to embrace, especially if he has family or friends who oppose the idea.
