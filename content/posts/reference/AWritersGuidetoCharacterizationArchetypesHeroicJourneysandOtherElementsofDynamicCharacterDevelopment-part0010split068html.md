A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
ROMANTIC TENSION
At this point you have a great understanding of all the archetypes and how they interact with each other. Why are romantic interactions important? Because love is universal.
Romance novels make up the largest market in the industry for a reason! Most of the highest paid authors are romance novelists. In fact millions of women devour romance novels in an effort to receive the love and romance they can’t find in their everyday relationships. Truth is we all are interested in love, which is why even manly action films have a love interest in them as a rule. There are very few films made without some sort of love interest.
Now that we’ve discussed the interactions between the sexes, I’d like to mention the three types of intimate scenes that exist. They are called Anticipation, Submission, and Empowerment.
Anticipation occurs when the lovers want to be together but can’t, so they anticipate being with each other. Usually there’s an obstacle keeping them apart, and this obstacle creates anticipation in the reader as well. “When will they get to be together?”
ARCHETYPES THAT FALL INTO THE ANTICIPATION SCENE EASILY:
FEMALE: Amazon, Father’s Daughter, Maiden, Mystic, Female Messiah
MALE: Businessman, Recluse, Fool, Male Messiah
For these archetypes, a job or other main focus will keep the attention on things other than the relationship, thus causing problems for the couple. This “distraction” may also keep the pair apart much of the time. For some of these archetypes, someone else has authority over his or her life, for example the Maiden and Fool, preventing them from running off to see their beloveds. In such situations, great longing can set in as well as deep fantasizing.
Submission means one person loves the other so much she or he would do anything to see that love returned. They will submit to almost any demand or requirement. Examples include the mistress who waits for years for her lover to leave his wife and the hero who has to prove himself to win over the heroine. The question is, “Will he find his love returned?”
ARCHETYPES THAT FALL INTO THE SUBMISSION SCENE EASILY:
FEMALE: Seductive Muse, Nurturer, Matriarch, Maiden
MALE: Protector, Woman’s Man, Artist
These archetypes are usually more focused on their ‘objects of affection’ rather than on their careers or daily living. They can be very emotionally vulnerable and easily taken advantage of.
Empowerment occurs when gender positions become reversed. In many cases, this means the woman gains a powerful position. She calls the shots, not because her male counterpart is submissive, but because she is willing to walk away from him if she has to. In most situations men have more power over circumstances than women do. It’s not unusual for a man to leave a woman so that he can do his job—just watch a typical western—but it is unusual for a woman to walk away for the same reason. The question becomes, “Will she leave him?” On the flip side the man can also decide to walk away from a woman, when he finds his own empowerment. A good example is the dentist character in The Hangover.
ARCHETYPES THAT FALL INTO THE EMPOWERMENT SCENE EASILY:
FEMALE: Seductive Muse, Amazon, Father’s Daughter, Mystic, Female Messiah, Maiden
MALE: Any male archetype
These archetypes can be very independent. They know how to build an identity of their own. They can separate from their lover and still be secure with themselves. The Seductive Muse may need another mate waiting in the wings before she can walk away, but she can still be strong enough to do it.
You will use this information later when you start plotting your character’s romantic story arc or subplot. For now I want you to write a love letter between your two main characters. You may be pleasantly surprised at what you discover about your character’s psyche and past history as you do this exercise.
