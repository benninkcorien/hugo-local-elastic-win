A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE WOMAN’S MAN
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Woman’s Man loves to be out and about. The Recluse, on the other hand, loves to sit still and be alone. Put these two in a room together and the Recluse finds his tolerance for flighty people tested. He can’t handle the Woman’s Man curiosity and playful nature.
Sometimes the Recluse chooses to be celibate, and this is something the Woman’s Man will never understand. Sex is so fun and enjoyable to him. Women are fun and enjoyable. He relates to them better than he does to men. Why deny yourself?
The Recluse highly values his spiritual or paranormal experiences, and this may be one area for them to engage in conversation since it is a right-brain creative function to experience other ‘dimensions’ of thought.
The Woman’s Man can teach the Recluse that sexuality can be a spiritual act in and of itself and that the self does not have to be denied in order to be spiritual. “Live, love, and laugh” is his motto.
The Recluse can teach the Woman’s Man to be by himself without feeling lonely.
