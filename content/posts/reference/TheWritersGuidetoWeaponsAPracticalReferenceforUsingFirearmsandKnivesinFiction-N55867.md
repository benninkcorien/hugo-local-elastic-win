Must-Know Firearm Laws, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Must-Know Firearm Laws
Firearm laws might not matter to the criminal characters in your fiction, but they can impact weaponry and the overall plot. While state and local regulations vary, there are four significant federal laws to consider before selecting a firearm for a character.
The National Firearms Act (1934)
The year 1934 should be a line in the sand when outfitting characters with firearms. Whereas characters prior to that year could get their mitts on anything so long as they had the money, 1934 marked the beginning of modern gun control.
In that year, the National Firearms Act (NFA) became law. It levied a $200 tax on so-called “gangster guns.” These included machine guns, submachine guns (Tommy guns, for example), shotguns with shortened barrels less than 18 inches (such as sawed-off shotguns), rifles with barrels less than 16 inches long, and suppressors (also known as silencers). These are all known collectively as “NFA firearms” or “Class III firearms.”
Under the Act, NFA firearms must be registered with what is now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). A local law enforcement official also has to sign off on the purchase or transfer of NFA firearms. These requirements remain today.
Surprisingly the Constitutional objections to the NFA had more to do with the Fifth Amendment—the right not to incriminate oneself—than the Second. After the NFA went into effect, anyone attempting to register a Class III firearm could be incriminating themselves, since possessing an unregistered firearm is a crime. The United States Supreme Court settled this Fifth Amendment matter in 1968 in Haynes v. United States. Parts of the NFA were ruled unconstitutional, making the Act difficult to enforce.
The Gun Control Act (1968)
The Haynes v. United States decision led to the passage of the Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968. It changed the NFA to satisfy Fifth Amendment concerns. It also broadened a number of restrictions regarding prohibited firearms and individuals.
Most significantly for this guide, the GCA established the Federal Firearms License (FFL) system to regulate sales and transfers of firearms. Holders of an FFL facilitate transactions between buyer and seller, including the physical transfer of the firearm. Their role is to make sure the transaction is legal.
Since that point, it takes three people for a firearm to legally change hands: the buyer, the seller, and the FFL representative. Consider that the rule of thumb when writing in legally purchased firearms, although exceptions exist in the real world.
The Firearm Owners’ Protection Act (1986)
In 1986, the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act (FOPA) amended the Gun Control Act to end production of fully automatic firearms for civilian use in the United States. No fully automatic firearm made after May 19, 1986, may be possessed, bought, sold, or transferred by U.S. civilians. Fully automatic firearms made before May 19, 1986, were grandfathered in and must be registered. They are highly regulated.
That’s important to remember when assigning full-autos to characters. Unless a character is in the military, belongs to a law enforcement organization, “knows a guy,” or is engaged in criminal activities, new full-autos are off-limits.
FOPA does not prohibit removing the fully automatic action—the part that fires ammunition—and placing it inside the body of a gun made after May 19, 1986. However, such a gun must still be registered.
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1994)
In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act went into effect. This created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This marked the birth of “background checks” for firearms.
Under the Act, FFL holders are required to check the NICS to see if a person is eligible to buy a firearm. Prohibited persons include:
anyone sentenced to more than one year of prison.
convicted felons.
fugitives.
users/addicts of controlled substances, as determined by certain court convictions.
those committed to mental institutions or found to be mentally defective by a court.
anyone unlawfully residing within the United States.
people in the United States on a visa and who are not immigrants.
dishonorably discharged members of the military.
those who have renounced U.S. citizenship.
anyone convicted of a misdemeanor (or more serious wrongdoing) related to domestic violence.
persons with a restraining order with regard to harassment, stalking, or threatening of an intimate partner or children.
If it matters to the story, the FBI goes into detail on these prohibitions at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/general-information/fact-sheet.
Why These Laws Matter
Consider these four federal laws before outfitting a character with any firearm. If setting is important to the story, the types of firearms available may depend on where the weapon falls within these important pieces of legislation.
For example, a Tommy gun would be easier to obtain prior to 1934, when the National Firearms Act went into effect. Tommy guns were introduced in 1921. So between 1921 and 1934, it’s most likely that a character would be able to buy a Tommy gun off the shelf hassle-free.
On the other hand, the FN SCAR, a machine gun introduced in the 2000s, wouldn’t be hanging on the wall of a sporting goods store. It was made after May 19, 1986, and therefore isn’t available to civilians.
Keep in mind that some legal semi-automatics, such as the popular AR-15, may look like fully automatics. It’s also possible to modify fully automatic firearms to function as legal semi-automatics for resale, as is the case with many civilian AK-47s. Both of these instances are legal.
However, it is difficult, and illegal, to convert a semi-automatic into a fully automatic. Characters would need an advanced knowledge of firearms and extensive access to parts to make a successful conversion. It’s not something that can be accomplished by walking into a sporting goods store.
Remember, when it comes to determining legality, form doesn’t matter as much as function.
On that note …
1994 Assault Weapons Ban
In September of 1994, the Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) went into effect. It prohibited the manufacture of firearms with a certain combination of “military-style” features in the United States for a period of ten years. These features included magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds, collapsible stocks, threaded barrels able to take screw-on accessories like suppressors, and others.
It prohibited only the manufacture of new firearms that have those characteristics. Those made before and after the ban (it expired in 2004) were exempt. That means characters wouldn’t necessarily be limited by the AWB. They’d simply obtain a firearm equipped with the features they want and also made outside of those years
The Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground Laws
Recent high-profile news stories, such as the trial of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, have put “Stand Your Ground Law” and “Castle Doctrine” at the forefront of national gun law discussions. For crime fiction, especially procedurals, these concepts can play an important role.
The Castle Doctrine can trace its roots back to English Common Law. Under this principle, a person has no obligation to retreat when threatened at home. A lethal act of violence on an intruder would therefore be justified. The Castle Doctrine is used as inspiration for state laws across the country. It’s not a singular rule or law. It’s a concept. And each state interprets it differently. Some require an attempt to retreat before force is justified, while others place an emphasis on the intruder’s intent.
Stand Your Ground expands the Castle Doctrine beyond the home. “Stand Your Ground” is a generic term for these laws. It’s not one law copy-pasted from state to state. The laws vary, but the primary theme is a presumption of reasonableness on behalf of the shooter. In the same way that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty for other allegations, the presumption under Stand Your Ground laws is that the shooter was justified in using lethal force outside the home. A legal obligation to retreat, the type of threat presented, and other factors are dictated in individual state laws to help further define that reasonableness.
If the case goes to court, that presumption of reasonableness means the shooter goes free if a majority of evidence shows that he or she acted in self-defense. The case may also be dropped at an earlier stage in the legal process for the same reason.
Clumsy legalese is what keeps lawyers in business, so here’s an example.
Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective, is gathering clues to a mass murder of circus clowns at a city park. The coulrophobic Bill Robber jumps out from behind a tree and demands Maynard hand over some particularly damning evidence. Seeing that his life is in mortal danger, Maynard draws his revolver and shoots the unarmed Bill to death. The district attorney charges Maynard with murder. But because that state has a version of its own Stand Your Ground law, and because most of the evidence suggests he acted in self-defense at the moment of the shooting, Maynard is found not guilty.
Stand Your Ground laws bring out intense debate about firearm policies. One of the chief criticisms is that they allow people with bad intentions to kill others without consequence. Supporters say they allow reasonable people to defend themselves without complication.
Regardless of your own opinion, Stand Your Ground laws are worthwhile to research if a plot point depends on legal consequences. Look up state statutes about self-defense to help. Just don’t expect them to be labeled explicitly as Stand Your Ground.
Stop the Threat: Firearms and Self-Defense in General
When it comes to firearms and self-defense, one overarching principle hovers above all others. Everyone from law enforcement to the military considers it. It’s this: “Stop the threat.”
It’s not “Shoot to kill.” That invokes a sort of bloodthirstiness.
It’s not “Defend life and limb.” That’s morally ambiguous.
It’s just “Stop the threat.” Someone or something is attempting to cause injury. Use the firearm to prevent that from happening. Listen for this phrase when law enforcement and military members are interviewed about violent encounters. It’s interesting how often it’s used.
With that in mind, one shot too many—after the threat has been stopped—can cross the line from defense into murder. That’s because self-defense laws are written to address disparity of force.
That means it’s considered self-defense so long as the attacker could overcome the individual with the firearm, even if the attacker is unarmed. One person versus five, for example. A small female attacked by a large male. A person in a wheelchair up against a more mobile attacker.
So long as that disparity exists and the threat is imminent, a self-defense situation is at hand. But the moment the disparity no longer exists, the person with the firearm must not pull the trigger again. If so, the situation changes from self-defense to murder.
Writers would do well to keep this in mind when crafting scenes involving self-defense and firearms. Immobilizing an attacker so you're no longer in danger is one thing. Continuing to fire until the attacker is dead is another.
Time for a real-world example.
On Thanksgiving Day 2012, two unarmed teenagers smashed a window and entered the home of Byron David Smith, 64, in Little Falls, Minnesota. Fearing for his life, Smith, home by himself, shot and killed both teenagers. Audio equipment Smith had set up in light of other break-ins recorded the incident.
Smith shot the teens as they descended a staircase toward him. He was well within the bounds of Minnesota law to do so, which allows for lethal force in the home when a life is threatened or a felony is being committed.
The situation took a major turn when Smith continued firing after the injured teens stopped posing a threat to him.
From an April 26, 2013, article in the Star Tribune:
[Prosecutors] said he also had an audiotape of the killings that recorded Smith telling [the male teenager] “You’re dead” in the seconds after he was shot. He later taunted [the female teenager] after shooting her several times, calling her “bitch” as he fired a shot beneath her chin and into her cranium, prosecutors said.
After stopping the threat from the teens, Smith should have dropped everything and dialed 911. He didn’t. His actions crossed the line from self-defense into murder. In April 2014, Smith was found guilty of several murder charges and sentenced to life in prison.
That the teens were unarmed and that Smith’s home had a history of break-ins both likely played upon the jury’s conscience. Neither were the deciding factors, though. After hearing the verdict, Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel summed why.
“This isn’t a case about whether you have the right to protect yourself in your home. You very clearly do,” Wetzel said in an April 30, 2014, Star Tribune article. “Rather, this was a case about where the limits are, before and after a threat to you or your home occurs.”
This is why fiction with an eye to the real world should keep the “Stop the threat” principle in mind at all times. Laws vary by state, but this principle is a constant theme. Once the threat is gone, put the gun down. That goes for knives, fists, feet, and any other method of inflicting injury.
For a thorough look at the law and self-defense, I highly recommend the books by Massad Ayoob published by Gun Digest.
Warning Shots: Not a Good Idea
Warning shots are staples of thrillers and crime fiction. As if brandishing a firearm wasn’t enough, proving a character is willing to use it ups the ante. Protagonists do this most often. Maybe that’s because antagonists just shoot other characters outright, but that’s beside the point.
Consider the “Stop the threat” principle from the previous section. The law doesn’t look kindly on using a firearm in an encounter for any other purpose than to stop the threat. Does a warning shot fulfill that requirement?
As I’ve mentioned in other parts of this book, no. Shooting a firearm near others when it doesn’t absolutely need to happen is not going to stop the threat. It’s also the first shot in a presumably tense situation—a shot that could provoke others to shoot back.
Concealed Carry Laws
The previous sections segue nicely into concealed carry laws. These laws govern how a person in public may carry an obscured firearm secured to his or her body (aka being “strapped”).
This is good information to know when outfitting a character, especially private detectives, with a concealed handgun.
With the addition of Illinois in July 2013, all fifty states—but not the District of Columbia—offer some form of a concealed carry policy, and each state outlines different requirements for legally carrying a concealed firearm in public.
Here are the three basic types of approved concealed carry, starting with the least restrictive.
Constitutional Carry: No concealed carry permit is required for anyone legally able to possess a firearm.
Shall Issue: If a person living in the state meets certain requirements, a permit will be issued.
May Issue: If a person living in the state meets the requirements, a permit still might not be issued for a variety of reasons.
As of this writing, the states and territories fall into each category this way. These can change, so use this information as a starting point in your research.
Constitutional Carry: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Vermont, Wyoming
Shall Issue: Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin
May Issue: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands
Does Not Issue Concealed Carry Permits (No Concealed Carry Allowed): American Samoa, District of Columbia, North Mariana Islands
As of this writing, there isn’t a federal concealed carry law, but something does come close: Many states offer reciprocity agreements. That means they’ll honor concealed carry permits issued in other states. These agreements change frequently. When writing about a character with a concealed carry permit traveling out of state, check the most current reciprocity agreement in the statutes. The website Handgunlaw.us is a good place to get started, especially the interactive reciprocity map at www.handgunlaw.us/LicMaps/ccwmap.php.
If a person is caught carrying a concealed firearm without a permit, the penalty could be a fine or jail time.
Open Carry Laws
Open carry is basically the opposite of concealed carry. Instead of keeping the firearm hidden, it’s out in the open in full view. These laws apply to all firearms, not just handguns.
As with concealed carry laws, states determine how open carry is regulated. Legally speaking, it’s generally easier for a character to openly carry a firearm than a concealed one.
Here’s the catch: Even if open carry is allowed, that doesn’t mean the character won’t look out of place. Many real-world news stories chronicle arrests of open carriers on the grounds of disorderly conduct. The stories usually involve someone spotting a guy with a gun in a public area and calling the police.
The rule of thumb: If people aren’t conditioned to seeing others walk around with guns in the public setting you are presenting (such as hunting areas, rural districts, farms, shooting ranges, etc.), then it’s not a good idea to stick a character openly carrying a firearm in it—even if it’s legal.
