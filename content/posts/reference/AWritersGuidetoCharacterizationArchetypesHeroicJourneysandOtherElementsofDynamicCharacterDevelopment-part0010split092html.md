A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Feeling:
   •  How does the heroine feel? The hero?
   •  How does it feel to the heroine to be naked?
   •  How does his body feel to her? His hand?
   •  What type of fabrics are in the room?
   •  Is the furniture soft or lumpy?
   •  Can she feel or sense his desire?
   •  Does the light make it feel warm and inviting? Or mysterious?
   •  How’s the temperature?
Describe love as if it were a feeling. “The butterflies in her stomach quickly turned into bees as he drew her near.”
