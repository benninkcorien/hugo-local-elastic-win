Forensics: A Guide for Writers
FOREWORD 
BY LEE GOLDBERG  
When I started out writing TV cop shows, I was taught to avoid the science stuff, the boring exposition that kills the momentum of a good story. Whatever the science was, and there shouldn’t be too much of it, you could quickly throw away in a line. You could have one of your cops say “the lab found trace evidence at the crime scene that leads directly to Doug Lyle,” and off we’d go to the next car chase, gunfight, or cat-and-mouse game of wits.
The only show I can remember that even showed a passing interest in science was Hawaii Five-O. In each episode you could count on blue-suited, lantern-jawed Steve McGarrett going down to see Che Fong who, in his white lab coat, would dryly spout useless exposition based on, at best, questionable science. It was so silly that every Naked Gun movie couldn’t resist spoofing it.
Nobody wanted science in their cop shows. They wanted good-looking heroes, fast-moving stories, quirky characters, and great action.
Did Columbo ever talk to a crime scene investigator? Hell no.
Did Jessica Fletcher ever consult a lab report? Get real.
How often did the cops of Hill Street Blues, Homicide, or NYPD Blue go down to the lab for a briefing? Almost never. They were too busy dealing with their complicated sex lives, their substance abuse problems, the bureaucracy of the legal system, and the political machinations within their police departments.
Why weren’t the TV writers behind those shows paying attention to forensics? Because it was exposition which, by definition, isn’t exciting. We believed that viewers didn’t care about physical evidence; they cared about people, they cared about passion, they cared about action. They were interested in whodunit, and whydunit, not particularly howdunit.
There simply wasn’t anything sexy, thrilling, or suspenseful about test tubes, fingerprints, bodily fluids, DNA, pubic hairs, and autopsies.
Or so it seemed.
Two TV crime shows changed all of that, turning conventional dramatic wisdom upside down: the real-life trial of O.J. Simpson and the fictional series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
The Simpson trial was a spellbinding education for millions of people into DNA and forensics. It wasn’t just a trial, or a media event, it was a classroom, introducing viewers to aspects of science they knew virtually nothing about. And it was utterly captivating.
Then along came CSI, a little cop show about crime lab technicians that nobody expected to succeed. But it was the right show at the right time, capitalizing on the audience’s discovery of forensics and putting the exposition front and center. The drama was all about the evidence; the people who committed the crimes, and their motives, became secondary in the story telling to whatever microscopic material they left behind at the crime scene. It broke every rule of television.
CSI was a true over-night sensation, a smash hit from the day it premiered. The series and its two spin-offs radically changed the way we tell mysteries on TV (and, I would argue, in movies and books, too). The show has even changed what real-life juries expect to see and hear from prosecutors in a courtroom.
But the fact is that CSI and its spin-offs and rip-offs are ridiculously unrealistic. The way the characters behave, the scope of their investigatory responsibilities, their legal authority in a case, their relationship to the police detectives, and the lightning-fast scientific results they achieve have absolutely no basis in reality.
There are no police crime labs on earth that look like the ones on the three CSI shows. Most crime labs are financially pinched, sterile, and drab … they certainly aren’t multimillion-dollar architectural wonders stocked with the latest, cutting-edge technology, banks of flat-screen monitors, and illuminated with multicolored, pinpoint halogen mood lighting.
You will never find a real-life crime scene investigator wearing Armani, carrying guns, questioning witnesses, and driving a chrome-plated Hummer.
As a veteran homicide detective I know says: “Star Trek is more realistic than CSI, and if one of those lab rats ever opened his mouth to question a witness, I’d shoot him.”
But success is its own reality to television network executives. So while you and I may know that CSI is fiction, it’s real to the people who develop TV shows. If you’re writing about crime on television, you’re required now to incorporate the world according to CSI into your fictional universe. More importantly, the audience expects it.
To me, the most obvious example of the inescapable CSI-ification of cop shows is the venerable Law & Order. If you look at the early episodes of the show, there isn’t a single crime scene tech in sight. At most, one of the detectives might refer to information that “just came in from the lab.” Now, in every episode, there’s a talkative CSI tech at each crime scene and the detectives have to make at least one obligatory stop at CSI HQ to get a multimedia briefing from some colorful tech in a lab coat … because if they didn’t, the audiences wouldn’t find the story “realistic.”
In the cop show universe, it doesn’t matter if CSI is totally fictional, it’s the new fictional reality by which all other fictional realities will be measured against for fictional “authenticity”… at least until another cop show becomes a breakout hit and redefines the way we tell crime stories.
Until that time comes, Doug Lyle’s book will be a necessary resource for writers crafting crime stories and for mystery fans who want to know more about the fictionalized science they see on cop shows. This is a book about how forensics work in the real world, not the magic performed by characters like Gil Grissom and Horatio Caine. And what you will discover is that the real world of forensics is, perhaps, even more compelling than what we are seeing on television every week.
