A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 10THE COYOTECURIOSITY & RESOURCEFULNESS
“If a Coyote totem has appeared in your life, be prepared for Murphy’s Law to enter your life with a vengeance. Your sense of humor will need to arise full force in keeping with the things happening around you.” LinsDomain.com
Back in 2006 a coyote found his fifteen minutes of fame when he made his way to Central Park and wandered the park for two days. And then in 2007 a coyote entered a busy restaurant in the Chicago Loop district. These incidents are great examples of the coyote’s curious and adventurous nature, as well as their ability to adapt to their surroundings.
Coyotes know how to survive and adapt with a sense of adventurous curiosity and play. It is amazing to note that thousands of them live in cities without having contact with humans. These tricksters break the rules and live life on their own terms.
Life can be miserable if we merely endure it and are constantly involved in the pain, suffering, and mishaps that are bound to happen (at least until one has reached a higher level of awareness). In any moment of any day, drama abounds if you look for it.
The best way to deal with the struggles of life is to learn to laugh at yourself and to do some foolish things once in a while to lighten the mood. You need to relax and indulge in a bit of silly adventurousness once in a while. In your old age, you will want some crazy memories to look back on.
