EMOTION: PARANOID
EMOTION: PARANOID
Quote: “Developing a character with genuine depth requires a focus on not just desire, but how the character deals with frustration of her desires, as well as her vulnerabilities, her secrets, and especially her contradictions. This development needs to be forged in scenes, the better to employ your intuition rather than your intellect.” —author, David Corbett
Giving a character an internal fatal flaw, such as paranoia when using the man vs. himself plot device to overcome might be an interesting growth ARC. A paranoid character will do reckless and rash things. He/she will be distrustful and fearful, or even unreasonable.
Recognizing the fatal flaw (character weakness) reveals what the character’s internal journey will be. It becomes a big part of the plot in terms of a character’s internal growth ARC, which will clarify the external conflict as well in your manuscript.
Flaws provide depth and tension, create empathy, and make a character more human. If a character has no flaws or seems too perfect, then all the conflict in the story is someone else’s fault, and your main character is just drifting through scenes as an observer, and not actually connected or being affected by anything that occurs. The problem is, readers need to care about what happens to the main character(s), so including a fatal flaw is a great way to achieve this.
Some physical signs of paranoia might be:
Tight jaw
Grinding teeth
Darting eyes
Mouth twitches
Restlessness / Pacing
Hyper-Alert
Folding arms over chest and shaking head
Mumbling to themselves
A disheveled appearance
Racing heartbeat
Eyes big and wide
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I felt very paranoid when I entered the cemetery.
DEEP POV: Dark imaginings filled my head, and I cast crazed looks around the graveyard.
SHALLOW: Aria’s paranoia was getting worse and she didn’t trust doctors.
DEEP POV: Shuddering uncontrollably, Aria pleads, “Please don’t make me go in to the hospital.”
SHALLOW: He spoke harshly and the tone made me feel even more paranoid.
DEEP POV: His voice didn’t sharpen, but it had an undercurrent that made Julia’s shoulders go up.
SHALLOW: I was paranoid and scared of the dark.
DEEP POV: I gritted my teeth and my gaze darted around the dark room.
SHALLOW: I felt paranoia every time I had to enter the police station.
DEEP POV: A creeping sensation inched its way across my arms as soon as I entered the building smarming with cops.
Here are two longer scenes to encourage writers to dig deeper with their descriptions and characterization. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the shallower writing, but please try to see if you can clearly identify it now that you’re more aware of showing vs. telling.)
Please carefully examine these examples…
SHALLOW (reads like a boring info-dump):
Maybe I was just feeling paranoid, but I hated showering in public places like my college dorm. Everyone else in the bathroom seems to feel comfortable undressed in public except for me.
I saw an empty shower stall, I move quickly past the girls either partially dressed or naked and then I pull the curtain closed tight, and I get undressed, and then hang my clothes on the rack outside the stall by sticking out one arm from the curtain. I turn on the shower, feeling fearful. The water takes a very long to get hot, and while I’m standing in the stall, I’m feeling paranoid that someone will open the curtain and they will see my naked body.
The shower is small and I do not have enough room to move. When I turn my body as I wash my hair, my elbow touched the rack that my clothes are on, and the clothing falls to the wet bathroom floor.
“I cannot believe that I did that.” I groan to myself, and shut the water off, and then wrap my towel around my body.
I grab my pile of wet clothes and then I leave the bathroom to walk down the corridor, and I hope no one sees me naked, but I feel paranoid that people are watching. I get to my room and open the door. As I push the door closed behind me, I see a tattooed, black haired young man sitting on my roommate’s bed. This is very embarrassing for me and I feel myself blush.
Please study this next revised version with “voice” and sensory details.
DEEP POV:
Shuffling my feet, I trudge down the corridor toward the bathroom like an inmate on death row. Showering in my college dorm has always made my skin crawl. It’s not about my body, but all the other bodies that were there before me. The need to let the water run blazing hot for ten minutes before I slid my flip-flops off and let my toes touch the floor is beyond OCD.
I hesitantly enter the humid space, clutching my toiletries firmly against my chest as my gaze scans the steamy room. Other girls are in differing arrays of dress, some half-naked while others walk around in just a thin towel. The combined odors of mildew and flowery shampoos assault my nose.
I spot an empty shower stall, and hurry into it, yanking the plastic curtain shut. With trembling fingers, I undress, and then lean out holding the curtain over my nakedness and hang my clothes on the rack. Quickly, I turn on the water, but it takes forever to get hot. The billowy steam helps to slightly ease my nerves.
Finally, in a cloud of steam, I’m able to speedily wash my hair. Just as I’m rinsing out the shampoo, my elbow pokes out of the curtain and hits the rack.
This. Cannot. Be. Happening. It’s like my worst fear come to life!
Turning off the water, I dry off, and then peek out the curtain. My shirt, jeans, and underwear lay in a soggy heap on the wet floor.
“Dammit,” I mutter.
I wrap the towel around my damp body. Leaning down, I snatch up my sodden clothes and make a mad dash back to my dorm room, holding the towel around me with one hand. I speed-walk like a racehorse galloping toward the finish line.
When I get to my room, I slam the door closed behind me, then slump against the wood and close my eyes. Finally.
Someone clears their throat. My eyes snap open, and a tattooed, black haired guy sitting on my roommate’s bed waves hello.
I want to die. Now.

Did you compare the last two examples? Are you starting to grasp how shallow writing pulls the reader out of the story?
Naming the emotion is a bad habit that writers easily fall into, which focuses the story on telling rather than showing. But Deep POV can turn a dull scene into one that remains in a reader’s thoughts long after the book has been read. So please don’t just state how a character feels, but try to make the reader actually feel it, too.
