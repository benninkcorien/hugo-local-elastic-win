A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Other characters may want to be a part of reaching the goal so they are going to support it and try to work in a group and communicate well and help the hero get the job done. They also may have their own agendas and reasons for seeing the job is done. In other words, other characters might support the hero in reaching his goal but their reasons for doing so can vary.
Communicating well is a special skill. When instructions are not carried out well, it is often because the person who delegated instructions did not communicate clearly and effectively. It may take patience and an extra second or two to provide detailed directions, but then you can let go knowing the person doing the work understands what’s expected of him. When working in a group, there is always a learning curve. In the beginning you just have to muddle through it. A lot of people have problems because they expect things to be perfect from the onset.
On the flip side, organizations that praise the group over the individual do not fully let their people explore their creativity. This is because often the group has rules and structures and systems in place for how things should be done. Therefore, the things an individual can offer a project often get lost. A lot of good ideas and opportunities may be lost when individual contributions are not being honored or sought.
