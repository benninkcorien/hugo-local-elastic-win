A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
COMBINING ARCHETYPES: IS AN AMAZON ALWAYS AN AMAZON?
Essentially real people may have many archetypes within their personalities, but one usually dominates. When assessing a personality I ask ‘What happened at an early age to cultivate this archetype in this character?’ Usually an event that happened during the developmental years causes a person to adapt to survive, and the way she adapts shows her dominant archetype.
When people are subjected to stress, their dominant archetype takes over. A Nurturer can believe in independence and equality, but those beliefs don’t make her an Amazon. Does she act to enforce these beliefs? Or are they only part of her backstory? In the major scenes, is she nurturing or speaking out? Basically we can all believe in saving the rainforest, but how many of us tie ourselves to a tree and fight for it like an Amazon would?
Likewise an Amazon, who raises children, let’s say, doesn’t cower when faced by the villain at the end of the story because at heart she’s still an Amazon.
