INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
Dear Writer,
I’ve been writing most of my life, and even though I’ve studied the craft for years, I still love developing my skills as a writer, and I’m assuming since you purchased this book that you do, too.
As requested from so many writers, I have written this companion book to my bestselling “The Writer’s Guide to Character Emotion.” This manual covers a whole new set of topics and provides step-by-step methods to deep editing techniques that will create gripping page-turners. Writers will learn how to create realistic dialogue, vivid settings and character descriptions, along with a strong, unique voice. Additionally, this handbook expands on how to master describing emotions, body language, and strengthen characterization with simple ways that writers can easily and quickly apply to their own writing.
In this guide, I also share some of the wisdom that I’ve gleamed from various workshops and online courses, along with the savvy advice from bestselling novelists and professional editors with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work with in the publishing industry. Plus, I’ve included insightful and inspiring quotes as additional encouragement.
Also, I thought I’d share a little about myself…I have over fifteen years of experience on all sides of the publishing business. I was a Creative Writing major, and I owned an eBook publishing company where I edited over a hundred manuscripts. Then I worked as a developmental editor for another publisher, and in the last five years, I’ve even had the honor of editing books for a number of successful authors.
In the past, I’ve been traditionally published, and through a small indie publisher, and I’ve even self-published my work. Currently, I’ve written eleven fiction novels and eight nonfiction titles, but it wasn’t until 2015 that I became a bestselling author, but the road to success has been a long journey. Many of my books have spent time on the 100 Kindle bestseller lists and some of my fiction has been chosen as top picks in the “Best Paranormal Romance” categories at several prominent review sites.
This manual is not a “grammar do or don’t” because mine is not the best, so please don’t contact the literary police. Writers should use these tips as an arsenal of creative knowledge to include in their writer’s toolbox. My goal is always for writers to come away with stronger writing and editing abilities that they can utilize in their own stories and give their audience a more personal reading experience.
Happy revising!
~S. A. Soule
