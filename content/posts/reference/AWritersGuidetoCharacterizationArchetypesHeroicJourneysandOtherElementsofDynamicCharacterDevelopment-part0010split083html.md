A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
The Beauty and the Beast Journey:
ACT I
   •  We meet the heroine and see how stable her life is, good or bad.
   •  An obstacle or chance meeting brings her in contact with the hero. He seems rough around the edges and is often a loner.
   •  The hero immediately falls in love with her for who she is, not because of her looks.
ACT II
   •  A task or situation forces them to be together.
   •  She is hesitant about their relationship.
   •  He does something so wonderful, thoughtful, or protective that she starts to fall in love with him.
   •  Obstacles keep them apart.
ACT III
   •  The hero is in trouble and she saves him with her love.
   •  They live happily ever after.
