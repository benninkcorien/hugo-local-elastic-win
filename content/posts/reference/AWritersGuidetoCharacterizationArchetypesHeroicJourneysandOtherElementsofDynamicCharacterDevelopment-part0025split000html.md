A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 19THE TIGERMYSTICISM & KINGSHIP
“Tiger stalks, the sheathed claws and defined muscles can transform in the space of a heartbeat from fluid, casual movement to a powerful burst of energy” —NamasteCafe
The tiger shares many qualities with other big cats including panthers and lions.
Being at the top of the food chain means they don’t have to worry about surviving the wild. Their strength, beauty, power, and ability to survive allows them the freedom to create vast territories, and to lounge around and enjoy life. Their power goes unchallenged and their beauty is immense.
I once visited a large cat preserve in California (shambala.org), where I was literary ten inches away from tigers, lions, and panthers. A chain-linked fence stood between us. It was a mesmerizing experience to be that close to these animals and to feel their power staring back at me. It was clear to me that they could choose at any moment to harm or not. I felt their raw instinct and knew somehow that if they wanted to attack, there wouldn’t be much I could do about it.
Yet something else drew me in as well. The cats displayed all of this power, yet I sensed something similar to typical human emotion. You would never see an animal like this abuse or torture a fellow friend, female, or offspring. It was just pure instinct.
