A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
The heroine’s lesson may make supporting characters feel uncomfortable, because no one likes to go through drastic changes in life. We like to think that if we face our little pebbles (problems) along the way, we won’t get hit with a big boulder. (This is usually true, but most of us ignore the pebbles.) Watching someone go through such a dilemma can be traumatic in itself. Oftentimes people like to come up with reasons someone else is going through such a thing, so they can avoid that reason and feel safe.
For example, in the case of attacks and rapes, studies have shown that uninvolved people want to get as much detail as possible about what happened, especially about what the victim was doing. This way, they can find some way to place blame on the victim. Doing so allows them to feel safe, because they can rationalize that they would not do such a thing. In getting all the details, they are trying to prove that the victim wasn’t just like everybody else and that this event could not have happened to just anyone, anywhere, at any time.
It is human nature to want to separate from this kind of experience and therefore the victim. This is how the other characters in this story may feel. An exception would be a Florence Nightingale kind of character, who wants to step in and help.
This is something that the heroine just has to endure and go through and come out on the other side of. Other characters can’t do too much for her outside of helping her survive what she is going through (the equivalent of shedding her skin). During the process of shedding their skins, snakes can develop a film over their eyes, which impairs their sight and makes them more vulnerable. They depend on their sense of smell in this situation. Your heroine will not be herself during this time, and she will feel vulnerable.
