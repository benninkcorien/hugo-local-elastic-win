Shotguns 101, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Shotguns 101
Shotguns are perfect for close- to mid-range encounters. These ranges depend on what kind of ammunition the character is using with the shotgun. Shot, the term for a bunch of BBs (small spheres of lead, steel, or other metal material), is effective at ranges out to 50 yards. A slug, which is a large single projectile, is effective out to 100 yards or so.
Pump-Action Shotguns
This is a pump-action Mossberg 870 shotgun. Note how sawing off the barrel wouldn’t make much of a difference in the firearm’s length. That’s why pump-actions aren’t the best candidates for making sawed-offs. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Popular pump-action shotguns: Benelli Nova, Ithaca Model 37, Mossberg 500, Remington Model 870, Winchester Model 12 
When people imagine a shotgun, they usually picture a pump-action shotgun, sometimes called a slide-action shotgun. The click-clack sound of the sliding pump, its most distinguishable feature, is made when the user “pumps” a sliding mechanism underneath the barrel back and forth. A single back-and-forth motion equals one pump.
That pumping motion works the action, which is the mechanism that moves ammunition through the firearm. One back-and-forth pump will transfer one shell (ammunition) from the magazine (a tube under the barrel holding ammunition) into the chamber (the spot at the base of the barrel where the shell is seated to be fired). That same pump will simultaneously eject a shell, if one is present, from the chamber.
I’ll repeat that in order to make a point: One back-and-forth pump will simultaneously eject and load one shell. This means that those television characters who unnecessarily and dramatically pump their shotguns during confrontational situations likely ejected unfired shells onto the ground, or they approached the situation with a shotgun that wasn’t ready to fire. If that’s confusing, just avoid dramatic pumping of shotguns, or any firearm, altogether. You’ll be accurate every time.
Advantages
Pump-action shotguns are among the most popular types of firearms in the world. They’re effective for hunting, sport shooting, and defense. It wouldn’t be out of place to outfit a character anywhere in the world, from the 1880s through today, with a pump-action shotgun.
Just about everyone is familiar with the click-clack sound of the pump-action. That sound alone can be enough to send others running.
Pump-action shotguns are considered safer than other firearms to operate. They require extra manipulation in order to fire them. Not only does the operator have to switch off the safety (a button or sliding switch that prevents the firearm from firing), she also has to physically pump a shell into the chamber. If a shell is already in the chamber, it is mechanically impossible to fire the shotgun unless the slide is all the way forward. These extra steps also increase reliability. Because the operator is manually working the action, there is less chance of mechanical failure.
Pump-action shotguns come in a variety of gauges (not calibers, unless a character is using the relatively weak .410 shotshell) to suit any number of needs. The most common are the 12-gauge and the 20-gauge, although there are several others. The smaller the number, the greater the firepower.
Disadvantages
An operator cannot fire a pump-action shotgun as quickly as a semi-automatic shotgun, although the pump-action’s reliability still makes it a good choice for a character in a firefight.
In fiction scenarios where stealth is required, a pump-action shotgun is not always the best choice. The click-clack sound of the action could give someone away.
Most shotguns cannot hold as much ammunition as most rifles. Shotgun magazines rarely carry ammunition in amounts beyond single digits. A character might be better off with a high-capacity rifle over a shotgun for that reason.
Inaccurate Example
Bill Robber had Maynard Soloman right where he wanted him.
“What’s the combination to the safe? Don’t play dumb; you know the one I’m talking about. The one with the secret recipe for Crystal Pepsi,” Bill said and aimed his semi-automatic shotgun at the detective.
Maynard raised his hands in the air and said, “1 … 2 … 3 … I forget the rest.”
Bill pumped the shotgun and switched the safety off.
“I’ll blow your brains out. Start talking,” Bill said.
“Seriously? You couldn’t guess the rest?” Maynard said.
Accurate Example
Bill Robber had Maynard Soloman right where he wanted him.
“What’s the combination to the safe? Don’t play dumb, you know the one I’m talking about,” Bill said and switched the safety off his pump-action shotgun.
Maynard raised his hands in the air and said, “1 … 2 … 3 … I forget the rest.”
Bill poked Maynard in the eye with the shotgun barrel.
"I’ll blow your brains out. Start talking,” Bill said.
“Seriously? You couldn’t guess the rest?” Maynard said.
What Went Wrong?
A couple of things went awry in the inaccurate example.
First, Bill pumped the shotgun for dramatic effect, which likely dropped an unfired shell onto the ground. Remember: Pumping a shotgun simultaneously loads a shell from the magazine into the chamber to be fired and ejects a shell, fired or unfired, from the chamber. Bill’s a paint-fumed nincompoop, but even he wouldn’t be that stupid. Better to write the intimidation in other ways, as I did with Bill prodding Maynard in the eye.
Second, a semi-automatic shotgun does not need to be pumped. It’s a completely different type of shotgun.
Semi-Automatic Shotguns
Popular semi-automatic shotguns: Beretta Xtrema2, Browning Auto-5, Mossberg 935, Remington Model 1100, Winchester Super X3 
A semi-automatic shotgun has no pump. Instead the action (the mechanism that cycles ammunition through the firearm) uses gas or a mechanical device to capture force from the recoil generated by shooting the firearm. It uses this force to simultaneously eject and load consecutive shells each time the shooter pulls the trigger. You just load and shoot; no pumping required.
The shooter manually loads the first shell into the chamber by working the charging handle (sometimes called a cocking handle). This handle functions similarly to the slide on a pump-action shotgun, except it’s a small tab or knob situated near the chamber (the place where a shell is seated to be fired).
This photo demonstrates how manually moving the charging handle back exposes the chamber, moving a shell from the magazine into the chamber. Or the operator might manually drop a shell in. Pressing the release (or just letting go in some models) snaps the charging handle forward, readying the firearm for shooting. With slight variations, this is how the first shell is loaded in all semi-automatic and fully automatic shotguns and rifles. (Author's photo.)
To fire the first shot, the shooter pulls the charging handle back manually. This seats a shell into the chamber from the magazine (the tube underneath the barrel where shells are held in reserve). The shooter could also manually drop a shell into the chamber. Then the shooter pushes a release button or switch so the charging handle snaps forward. The shell is ready to be fired. Some models don’t have a release. The shooter would just pull back the charging handle and let go. Write around that detail if you’re not sure.
The semi-automatic action takes over only after the first shell is fired. This is because recoil to drive the action isn’t produced until a shot is fired. Only one shell will fire per pull of the trigger. The shooter cannot hold down the trigger and have the shotgun continuously fire. That’s why it’s called a semi-automatic. A fully automatic shotgun would allow the operator to continuously fire so long as the trigger is pulled.
Outside of the military, video games, and a few hardcore firearms collectors, it is rare to encounter a fully automatic shotgun. If a scene calls for one, treat it like a semi-auto. The difference is it would fire continuously so long as the trigger is pulled. Full-autos are also heavier, since they have to carry more shells in their magazines.
Like pump-action shotguns, semi-autos use a magazine located under the barrel to house ammunition. Pump-actions and semi-autos look similar because of this, but some high-capacity semi-automatic shotguns use detachable drums (a pancake-shaped ammunition magazine).
Advantages
Semi-automatics can fire rounds faster than any other type of shotgun, except for fully automatics. They’re ideal for firefights.
Once loaded, semi-autos are simple to operate. Just switch off the safety, aim, and pull the trigger. Keep pulling until the ammunition runs out.
Just like pump-action shotguns, semi-automatic shotguns come in a variety of gauges (not calibers, except for the relatively weak .410) to suit any number of needs. The most common are 12- and 20-gauge, although there are many more. Remember, the smaller the number, the greater the firepower.
Like pump-action shotguns, semi-automatic shotguns are among the most commonly owned firearms. They’re perfect for hunting, shooting sports, and defense.
Disadvantages
Because they contain more moving parts, semi-automatic shotguns are considered less reliable than other shotguns. Failure by some component of the action may cause ammunition to jam. Writers can use a well-timed jam to their advantage.
Most shotguns cannot hold as much ammunition as most rifles. Shotgun magazines rarely carry ammunition in amounts beyond single digits. A character needing to crank out a lot of shots would likely choose a rifle over a shotgun.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard loaded shells into his semi-automatic shotgun’s magazine, then squeezed the trigger. He held it down as the body of Bill Robber absorbed shot after bloody shot.
When the smoke cleared, what was left of Bill and his belongings spackled the floor, walls, and ceiling. Maynard spat a nugget of Bill’s gore from his lips, grinned, and pumped the shotgun.
“Now to collect my money,” he said and peeled from the bloody wall the twenty bucks Bill owed him for gas.
Accurate Example
Maynard jacked the first shell into his semi-automatic shotgun’s chamber, then squeezed the trigger. He pulled it again and again as the body of Bill Robber absorbed shot after bloody shot.

“Now to collect my money,” he said and peeled from the bloody wall the twenty bucks Bill owed him for gas.
What Went Wrong?
Two functions of the shotgun are in conflict in the inaccurate example. Maynard doesn’t pump the shotgun between shots as he shoots Bill. He just pulls the trigger. A paragraph later, he pumps the shotgun. The shotgun must be either an automatic or a pump, but not both.
For the purposes of this example, let’s say it’s an automatic. Is it a semi-auto or a full-auto? The trigger pulling needs to match. If Maynard fires a semi-automatic shotgun, as in the accurate example, he’d pull the trigger “again and again.” He wouldn’t hold it down, since semi-autos fire once per trigger pull.
A somewhat sneakier error is in the magazine loading. Loading the magazine isn’t enough to start firing with semi-autos. The shells in the magazine need to get into the chamber somehow. That means working the charging handle. The accurate example takes this into account when Maynard “jacked the first shell.”
Single-Shot and Double-Barrel Shotguns
This decked-out 20-gauge Stoeger is an example of a side-by-side double-barrel shotgun. Although fiction doesn’t often dress these shotguns up with extras, don’t let that stop you from doing so in a story. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Popular single-shot and double-barrel shotgun brands: Browning, Ithaca, Rossi, Savage Arms, Winchester 
As their names suggest, single-shot and double-barrel shotguns can hold only one or two shells, respectively. Triple-barrels and quad-barrels do exist, but they’re uncommon.
The majority of single-shot and double-barrel shotguns are loaded by “breaking” open the action. This is called a break-action. The shooter uses a lever or release that cracks open the action (it looks as if the gun is on a hinge) and exposes the chamber(s) (the spot where ammunition is seated to be fired). The shooter places shells directly into the chamber, then closes the action.
Double-barrel shotguns can be split into two categories: over-under and side-by-side. With an over-under, one barrel sits on top of the other. With a side-by-side, the two barrels are horizontal to each other.
Double-barrel shotguns sometimes feature two triggers, known as double triggers. Each barrel gets its own trigger. Other versions have a single trigger controlled by a switch that designates which barrel is being fired.
Some, but not all, single-shot and double-barrel shotguns use a hammer (a lever located behind the action that moves the firing pin). When the hammer is pulled back, the shotgun is cocked (ready to fire). When the hammer is forward, the shotgun is unable to fire. An operator may manually move the hammer forward without firing it. To do so, he or she would simultaneously pull the trigger and carefully guide the hammer into its forward position.
Advantages
Single-shot and double-barrel shotguns are among the most reliable firearms because they contain the fewest number of moving parts.
Because of their simple design, single-shot and double-barrel shotguns are lighter in weight than other shotguns. They’re a good choice for characters who spend a lot of time on their feet.
Just like other shotguns, single-shots and double-barrels come in a variety of gauges to meet a number of needs.
Disadvantages
These shotguns lack a magazine (a place inside the firearm where ammunition is held in reserve). That means they can’t put out a high rate of fire. In a firefight with a lot of lead in the air, the shooter will be reloading often.
The light weight of single-shots and double-barrels means they don’t absorb as much recoil (the energy exerted on the shooter upon firing a shot). They “kick” the shooter harder when fired. Heavier shotguns absorb more recoil, lessening the kick.
The addition of a second trigger on a double-barrel shotgun could confuse a character during a tense situation. The character might pull a trigger that’s already been fired. Or conversely, the character might fire unintentionally.
Inaccurate Example
Bill Robber unloaded the double-barrel shotgun into Maynard’s generous gut without mercy. Bang. Bang. Bang.
He cocked the hammer back, reloaded, and continued firing until the daylight peeked through the meaty window scooped out from the detective’s motionless body.
Accurate Example
Bill Robber unloaded the double-barrel shotgun into Maynard’s generous gut without mercy. Bang. Bang. He paused only to break open the shotgun and reload. The downtime between the gore gave the detective a moment to get the last laugh.
“Hey, Bill. What’s the difference between a full-time writer and a part-time writer?” Maynard said.
“I don’t know, what?” Bill said and finished reloading the next two shells.
“Unemployment.”
What Went Wrong?
The math needs to work in any scene involving firearms. A double-barrel shotgun can fire two shots before reloading. Bill fired three times in the inaccurate example.
Bill’s reloading method is suspect, too. This particular double-barrel shotgun uses a hammer (not all do). A hammer is cocked prior to pulling the trigger, not when reloading. Bill should be described as breaking open the shotgun to reload instead.
Sawed-Off Shotguns
Sawed-off shotguns can also be written as sawn-off shotguns. Both sawed and sawn are past participles of saw. These grammatical nuances are sure to be percolating in the heads of characters using sawed-offs (or sawn-offs) as they knock off a gas station. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
The sawed-off shotgun isn’t a type of firearm. It’s simply a shotgun in which the barrel has been modified—or “sawed off”—to become less than 18 inches long.
Some shotguns are legally manufactured this way, so they’re not “sawed off” per se. Any civilian qualified to purchase firearms can legally own these short-barreled shotguns. They are considered National Firearms Act (NFA) or “Class III” firearms. This means that a character is required to register the gun with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and to pay a $200 tax, plus get permission from the chief law enforcement official for his or her jurisdiction. This requirement, which also applies to fully automatic firearms, has been in place since 1934.
However, a character might skirt these regulations and literally saw off the barrel of a shotgun. It’s illegal to do so, and it’s why sawed-off shotguns have a reputation for criminal activity. A character would not be able to buy an illegally modified sawed-off shotgun at a legitimate retailer or pawnshop. And despite the ability of some law enforcement officers and gun collectors to obtain legally manufactured sawed-off shotguns, the rule of thumb for fiction is that they are otherwise illegal.
Any type of shotgun could become a sawed-off shotgun. However, single-shot or double-barrel shotguns are most ideal, because no pump or magazine stands in the way of shortening the barrel.
The firepower of a shotgun doesn’t increase after it becomes sawed off. Ammunition determines firepower, not barrel length. Nothing about a sawed-off shotgun makes it more powerful than its long-barreled counterpart.
Advantages
Sawed-off shotguns are lighter and less bulky. They’re easier for a character to transport or conceal.
A shorter barrel means a character has better maneuverability without sacrificing firepower.
Sawed-off shotguns are ideal for close-range combat. The shorter barrel allows for a wider shot pattern (the term for the cloud of BBs that exits the shotgun upon firing) at close ranges. This means a target character a few yards away could be hit by more BBs.
It’s possible for a physically powerful character to use a sawed-off shotgun with one hand, given its lighter weight.
Disadvantages
A sawed-off shotgun is a major indicator that its user could be a criminal.
A character firing a sawed-off with one hand is probably underestimating the recoil (the force exerted on the shooter from firing the gun). Shotguns are designed for two-handed use. When used correctly, recoil is directed through the stock into the shooter’s shoulder. Shooting with one hand means wilder recoil and decreased accuracy. It’s not impossible to shoot a sawed-off with one hand; it’s just challenging.
A shorter barrel equals a reduced effective range. Longer barrels increase accuracy, since they give projectiles more time to spin before they exit the firearm. Shorter barrels have the opposite effect. A rule of thumb is to reduce the range of shot (BBs) to 25 yards. Shooting slugs from a sawed-off isn’t a good idea except at close ranges out to a few yards.
Inaccurate Example
“My puny shotgun just won’t cut it,” Bill Robber said to the mirror. “Maynard’s beer gut is too bloated for the slugs to get through. And his sleuthing skills are keeping my gluten-free bottled water smuggling operation from reaching shelves. I need more firepower.”
“Then cut the barrel off to really make that shotgun hum. Maggots will feast on the flavor of your rage,” said Bill’s split personality, Ted.
Accurate Example
“My puny shotgun just won’t cut it,” Bill Robber said to the mirror. “Maynard’s beer gut is too bloated for the BBs to get through. And his sleuthing skills are keeping my gluten-free bottled water smuggling operation from reaching shelves. I need more firepower.”
“Maybe it’s time you upgrade from a .410 to a 12-gauge shotgun,” said Bill’s split personality, Ted.
What Went Wrong?
The major mistake is the shotgun upgrade. If Bill needs more firepower, cutting the barrel isn’t going to change anything. Trading in his .410 for a 12-gauge is the better bet.
Bill’s complaint about the slugs failing to penetrate Maynard’s gut isn’t quite right. A hit from a shotgun slug (a single, solid projectile) is going to hurt. Granted, BBs hurt, too, but Bill shouldn’t be concerned if he’s making hits with slugs. They’re devastating.
On that note, Bill might be firing from too far away to make the BBs count. It’s possible to catch a BB from a shotgun and not suffer a serious injury. Instead of upgrading his shotgun, Bill might also consider moving closer to his target.
