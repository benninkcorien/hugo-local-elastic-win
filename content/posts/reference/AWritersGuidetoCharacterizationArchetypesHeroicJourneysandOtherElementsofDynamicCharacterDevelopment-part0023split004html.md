A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Other characters can become very jealous of someone finding real love and connection in this world. It’s something we all aspire toward in life, a basic desire among all people. Misery loves company, however, and many feel if someone else has ‘it,’ that diminishes the supply of ‘it’ to be had. (Instead, they should see it as an example of what is possible.) Hopefully some characters see it as a sign that such connections are possible.
As all-American hero: Supporting characters are not going to be comfortable acknowledging that the hero may have lost his edge, unless, of course, they harbor jealousy and animosity toward him. Most will feel that somebody needs to be that symbol of hope and success and freedom. He’s the go-to guy when they need to feel safe. They do not want to face the fact that he may not be the same guy he always was. This downgrading of strength or skill is a stage used in most action stories to create drama and call the hero into question. Will the hero save the day, or not?
