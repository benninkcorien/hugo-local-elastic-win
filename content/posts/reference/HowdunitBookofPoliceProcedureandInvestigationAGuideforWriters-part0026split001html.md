APPENDIX B
POLICE 10 CODESPolice 10-codes were originally developed to allow law enforcement officers to converse in secret, preventing the public from understanding their confidential conversations.Not all departments use the same 10-codes, which makes it difficult for officers from different departments to communicate during times of disaster and mutual aid, such as during the 9-11 and Hurricane Katrina catastrophes. As a result, some police departments in the United States have banned the use of 10-codes. officers in those departments converse in a universal language — in other words, plain English. Therefore, instead of saying, “10-4,” an officer would simply say, “Okay.”Some sample 10-codes include:10-1: Receiving signals poorly.10-2: Receiving signals well.10-3: Stop transmitting.10-4: Okay/affirmative.10-5: Relay message.10-6: Busy.10-7: Out of service.10-8: In service.10-9: Repeat message.10-10: Fight.10-11: Talking too fast — repeat message.10-12: officials or visitors present — don't transmit sensitive information.10-13: Advise of weather and road conditions.10-14: Escort.10-15: Prisoner in custody.10-16: Pick up prisoners at_____.10-17: Pick up papers at_____.10-18: Complete present assignment quickly.10-19: Return to station.10-20: Location.10-21: Call by telephone.10-22: Take no further action.10-23: Arrived on scene.10-24: Departing scene.10-25: Can you contact_____?10-26: Motorist assist at______.10-27: Driver's license information.10-28: Vehicle registration information.10-29: Check for stolen/wanted.10-30: Doesn't conform to rules.10-31: Breathalyzer operator needed.10-32: Is Breathalyzer available?10-33: Emergency/officer down.10-34: Trouble at this station.10-35: Confidential information.10-36: Correct time?10-37: Operator on duty?10-38: Ambulance needed at______.10-39: Your message delivered.10-40: Advise if officer available.10-41: On duty.10-42: Off duty.10-43: Department vehicle in accident.10-44: Check for record/wanted.10-45: Taking a coffee break.10-46: Mental patient.10-47: Possibly armed and dangerous.10-48: NCIC hit — subject is possibly wanted.10-49: Noninjury accident.10-50: Traffic accident.10-51: Tow truck needed at ______.10-52: Set up roadblock at______.10-53: Discontinue roadblock.10-54: Estimated time of arrival.10-60: Traffic stop, location______.10-61: Clear of traffic stop.10-62: Unable to copy; use phone.10-63: Network directed to______.10-64: Network clear.10-65: Awaiting next assignment.10-67: All units comply.10-69: Any traffic for this unit?10-70: Stopping vehicle; may be danger.10-71: officer is clear from 10-70.10-72: Information incomplete.10-73: Information not in proper form.10-77: Negative contact.10-80: Private vehicle.10-81: officer in trouble at______.10-82: Trouble at station.10-83: Bomb threat.10-84: DOA or dead body.10-85: Keep vehicle under surveillance.10-86: Pick up partner.10-87: Aircraft assignment.10-88: Advise phone number for call.10-90: officer welfare check.10-91: Talk closer to mike.10-93: Check my frequency on channel.10-94: Give me a test count/radio check.10-97: Report to garage for repairs.10-98: Last assignment completed.10-99: Wanted person.10-200: Police needed at______.
