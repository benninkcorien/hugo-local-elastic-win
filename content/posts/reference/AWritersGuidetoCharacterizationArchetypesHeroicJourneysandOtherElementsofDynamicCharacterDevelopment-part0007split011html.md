A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE MYSTIC
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two types are very much alike. The Amazon loves her solitude, though not as much as the Mystic does. The Amazon needs causes and people to fight for. She likes to be in the thick of things while the Mystic likes to be away from all attachments. ‘Live and let live; everything will work out,’ she says.
The Amazon can teach the Mystic how to take a stand and fight for what she believes in. The Mystic does have opinions and causes; she just supports them in solitary ways.
The Mystic can teach the Amazon to relax and take some time to renew herself. The Amazon’s bones ache and her mind can get overwhelmed at times with all of her planning and fighting.
