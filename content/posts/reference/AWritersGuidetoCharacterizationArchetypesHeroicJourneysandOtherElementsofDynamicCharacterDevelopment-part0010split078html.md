A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Romantic Themes:
LOVE CONQUERS ALL: You need someone to help you gain the courage to face yourself and your inner demons so you can heal. (Example: The hero has a drug addiction.) There’s a tug between desire for the love of your life and a fear of commitment. Other things try to take precedence over the relationship.
SECOND CHANCES: You try to recapture lost love and want to go back to a specific time in your life when things were better. This new person is a chance to recapture what you are missing in your life.
SLEEPING BEAUTY ARCHETYPES: Father’s Daughter, Mystic, Female Messiah, Amazon
PRINCE ARCHETYPES: Businessman, Male Messiah, Fool, Woman’s Man
Variations on this story include The Tale of the Needle by Emma Donoghue.
