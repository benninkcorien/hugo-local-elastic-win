A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE AMAZON
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
This is an interesting pair—the Seductive Muse loves her body and is very spontaneous. She can go with the flow of life more easily than the Amazon who needs to be more in control. At the same time the Amazon is very accomplished because she can set limits and disciplines herself to get the job done.
They are both very earthy, creative, right brain types. Neither of them have aspirations to run a megacompany like the Father’s Daughter. But, while the Seductive Muse will find a man to support her lifestyle, the Amazon will simply assume the lifestyle she wants and do what is necessary to keep it.
The Amazon can teach the Seductive Muse how to set limits and accept discipline as a positive part of life. She can teach her to be more selective in her choices and to value herself as a woman.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Amazon how to let loose and enjoy the spontaneous moments of life, how to be soft and sensual, how to pamper herself and enjoy the luxuries of life.
