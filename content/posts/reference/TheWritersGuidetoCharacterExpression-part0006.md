DEEPER POV
DEEPER POV
Quote: “The difference between showing and telling can be set out in four words.  Showing reveals. Telling explains.” —author, James Thayer
In the early drafts of a manuscript, telling is expected. It is more important to get the story finished and the plot holes filled in, then to worry about if a writer is showing enough character expression or emotion through a Deeper POV.
It is during the revision stage of later drafts (more like draft five or six) when it’s time to polish the storyline and start checking for red flags of telling and begin enhancing the characterization, along with the setting and dialogue.
Just stating that you need to “dig deeper” or having someone say, “don’t show” can become confusing for a lot of writers. I think that’s one reason that I wanted to share my knowledge and understanding of the Deep POV technique.
When writers are told to show, don’t tell, they’re frequently left without any step-by-step instructions on how to fix those problem areas in a story, and even when not to use Deep POV, so this guide should help shed some light on those issues.
The Deep POV method can be used in a lot of different ways besides the obvious ones, like show emotions or just getting inside a character’s head. It can also create engaging dialogue, aid in describing characters and vivid settings through sensory details, and even strengthen characterization. We just need to understand how and when to apply it.
Showing merely means allowing the reader to deeply experience things for themselves, through the viewpoint and perception of a character. Deep POV is just describing everything that your character is feeling, observing, and identifying, along with whatever they’re seeing, hearing, touching, and smelling, etc.
Throughout this guide, I have included examples to demonstrate how writers can avoid narrative distance in easy to grasp methods that can instantly improve anyone’s writing.
*Please note that while all of the examples in my guidebooks have already been used (mostly in my own novels published under Sherry Soule), writers can turn almost any of these Deep POV examples into new, unique phrases that fit your own stories. The purpose of the examples that I provide are to get your own creativity flowing enough to come up with innovative ways to describe your character’s expressions, emotions, and settings in your own distinctive style.
Let’s check one example below…
SHALLOW: Sara realized that she had forgotten the baby at home.
DEEP POV: The thought struck her like a punch to the gut. She’d forgotten the baby at home!
Now ask yourself: which example caused more impact?
If Deep POV (showing) demonstrates detailed proof to the reader and permits them to obtain their own conclusions, than telling (stating the emotion or details) states a fact to the reader, telling them what to accept as true.
For instance, stating (telling the reader) that a character “realized” something, like she was late for work, is fine, but it is also somewhat shallow. Instead, a writer can show that the character is late by her rushed actions.
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW: I woke up and looked at the clock. I realized that I was late for work. I quickly showered and got dressed. Then I ran out the door.
DEEP POV: The morning light seeping through the window burns my eyes. Rolling over, I check the alarm clock. It’s after eight.
Groaning, I throw back the blankets and rush into the bathroom. I hurry through a shower without washing my hair, and then brush my teeth. Back in the bedroom, I go to the closet and dig through the trendy garments, ripping clothes from the hangers. I glance at the clock again.
Ten minutes left before I miss my bus.
Needing a jolt of espresso, I yank on a dress and slip on my shoes. On my way out the door, I grab my purse and dash outside into the bright morning sunshine.
Could you perceive the difference? One is telling the facts in a bland way and the other is showing in a visual way.
Please study this example, where each sentence is telling…
SHALLOW: Kate noticed that it was getting late and it looked very dark. She felt cold. When she saw the shadows moving and heard a strange howling, she felt scared. She saw the house and she started to run very fast on the path.
Although, the first scene states the facts, it’s inert and sluggish.
Here is a revision, where the same information is shown…
DEEP POV: The sky darkened and the wind wailed through the stiff branches on the pines. Kate shivered and hugged herself. The shadows shifted and the eerie howl of a wolf cut through the air. Her pulsed jumped. Kate spotted the porch lights glowing on the house and she sprinted along the path.
The second scene is much more vivid and visual, right?
In the second version the reader has all the same information–dark sky, the feeling of coldness, the fear, seeing shadows, hearing the howls, introspection, and started running—but the revised example is vividly alive because the reader has been given something to clearly visualize rather than reading a bland report.
Showing is more effort than just telling, but that is part of a writer’s job during revisions. 
Please compare these examples…
SHALLOW: He looked depressed.
DEEP POV: Tears slid down his pale face.
SHALLOW: He felt angry.
DEEP POV: He clenched his fist and his mouth formed a thin, flat line.
SHALLOW: She looked happy.
DEEP POV: She jumped in the air, clapping her hands.
SHALLOW: She felt envious.
DEEP POV: Her gaze narrowed and one side of her lip curled upward.
SHALLOW: He looked nervous.
DEEP POV: He chewed his bottom lip and fidgeted with his keys.
Most of the time, using Deep POV to show is much better than telling because of the experience it provides for our readers.
Now just to be clear, telling isn’t always the wrong way to describe an emotion or reaction. It doesn’t always indicate flat, shallower writing. Please take into consideration that “show, don’t tell” is not a strict writing rule. As a matter of fact, none of the self-editing tips in this Deep POV book should be deemed as actual rules. There are going to be times in a writer’s story when telling will be needed, because sometimes telling can be much more effective if done correctly. However, whenever a writer can use Deeper POV in their stories, they should treat their readers with respect by showing.
So just keep in mind that showing vs. telling is all about balancing the two concepts.
