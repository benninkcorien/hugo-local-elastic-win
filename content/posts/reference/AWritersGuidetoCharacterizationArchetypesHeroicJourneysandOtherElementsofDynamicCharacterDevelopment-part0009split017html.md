A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE ARTIST
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two solitary types are in touch with their emotions. Unlike the Recluse, however, the Artist handles being around people and may enjoy going out for a night on the town. He is very expressive compared to the Recluse.
The Artist can teach the Recluse how to help others who are mystical and in need of guidance. He can show the Recluse how to help in ways that are comfortable to him. He also can assure the recluse that he doesn’t have to be available to all for all kinds of different problems and issues.
The Recluse can teach the Artist how to get in touch with his shadow side, or deep inner nature, to face his demons.
