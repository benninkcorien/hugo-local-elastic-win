A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 7THE BEARPATIENCE & CONNECTION
“The bear is a powerful symbol and image in both myth and lore. Stories abound of individuals turned into bears, bears into humans, and bears as gods.” —Ted Andrews (Animal Speak)
The bear uses inner resources of stored fat and the ability to shut down the kidneys to survive hibernation. Accordingly, this lesson is about learning how to sit with ideas, projects, and goals, and how to take time before moving forward. It’s also about how to go with the flow while using inner resources.
Remember to let your hero dabble in the sweetness of life as well. Bears love their honey, and they feel connected to their tribe.
This lesson is about gaining control by giving up control—giving up the reactive, overly emotional way of dealing with a problem. It’s not like a bear can decide not to hibernate and not to go with his natural cycles and instincts. The act of hibernating gives bears a strong sense of renewal, health, and rest. They go with their instincts and allow their bodily cycles to run their lives. In spite of what humans assume, bears are not aggressive by nature and are very loving with their young. They may be ferocious in strength but they don’t want to bother much with humans. They only defend themselves if need be.
For a time I lived in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, where I soon discovered that bears fed from our garbage in the morning. When I saw a bear, I became quite scared. It’s odd for a city person to face such a thing. But the bears didn’t bother anyone—they had only stopped by for an easy snack.
