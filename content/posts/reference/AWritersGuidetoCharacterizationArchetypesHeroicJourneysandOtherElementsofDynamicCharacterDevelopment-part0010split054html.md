A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
EMOTIONAL VS. MENTAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. This may be something she can help him with because she isn’t an emotional person. She can also teach him to use his mind instead of his emotional instinct all the time.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. The Artist can’t help her with these things, but he can teach her to get in touch with her creative, intuitive side which is more feminine.
They are not very comfortable around each other. He has a hard time understanding all of the intellectual jargon she uses and wonders if she is trying to impress him or make him feel stupid. She can be a good balance for him, but they will have a tough time making things work if she’s too assertive. She’s attracted to powerful men, which he is, but he may not be mentally focused enough for her taste.
She is not much of a muse for him, and he may get bored with her corporate lifestyle and long hours at work. He can find many women who would enjoy long hours with an artistic man.
