A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHARACTER ARC
The wolf is mainly about being able to work in a group to achieve a goal, or to survive. But at the same time, the wolves are able to retain their individuality within their social structure. Some cultures put an excessive emphasis on the individual and some put that emphasis on the group, but this lesson is about having both at the same time.
Learning how important the group as a whole is to individual survival and reaching a goal is key. A bunch of strong individuals coming together as a pack or a group can achieve many great things.
The wolf’s lesson is about working in a group and accepting help from others in the group—a concept that a lot of strong-willed people have trouble understanding. Such types feel like they need to do everything themselves; nobody else can do a job as well as they can do it. Eventually they come around to seeing the benefits of belonging to a social structure—a family, a group of friends, people at work—that they can rely on. They see how this benefits the individual and how the individual benefits the group.
They also learn the good that comes with communication. Those who work in a group in any capacity must be able to communicate clearly, specifically, and directly. Humans tend to communicate in very incongruent ways; they might say the word yes while shaking their head no, and vice versa. Our body language doesn’t coincide with what we are communicating verbally.
Many heroes try to go it alone, only to find they really need that sidekick or institution or a group. In The Hangover, the main characters mention their wolf pack. They vow not to tell anybody what happened in Vegas. And each guy expresses how valuable the group experience was to him. The wolf pack needn’t be a lifelong group the hero will be a part of forever. It can take the form of a transient group dynamic.
