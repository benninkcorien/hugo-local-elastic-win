Improvised and Custom Firearms, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Improvised and Custom Firearms
This guide considers three categories of improvised firearms: zip guns, custom, and plastic (including 3-D printed).
Zip Guns
Zip guns are firearms assembled from everyday objects. The “zip” comes from how fast they’re thrown together—in a zip. They fire regular ammunition from a store, though, not homemade cartridges.
I’m not going to outline steps to make zip guns, since that’s treading on some gray legal territory. I’ll stick to the parts that anyone with a basic understanding of physics and projectiles could deduce. I don’t recommend any writer (or anyone at all) try making a zip gun, not even for research purposes. There are better ways to lose a finger.
The manufacture of firearms, even sloppy ones, is subject to federal and state regulations. When writing fiction, assume zip guns are illegal, then research the setting to prove they’re not (if that’s important to the plot). They aren’t always 100 percent illegal; it depends on the state they’re made in, on the barrel length of the gun, the parts used, whether the gun is for personal use, and other factors.
Firing a zip gun can be dangerous. The shooter risks injury from exploding gunpowder that the guns’ homemade parts cannot contain. Also, if the striker (usually a small pin or nail) doesn’t hit the primer (the part of the cartridge that ignites the gunpowder when struck) hard enough, several seconds could go by before the zip gun fires.
These downsides, however, could be a benefit for establishing characters or settings. Zip guns speak to the desperation of the characters using them.
For a zip gun that does work, .17 and .22 caliber cartridges are the best bets for ammunition. They’re inexpensive and offer little recoil. Shotgun shells, especially the .410, work well, too, since they tend to fit into homemade components, such as metal pipes.
While it’s possible to use other types of ammunition, none of them are good choices. Unless machined specifically for firearms, the DIY materials used to make a zip gun probably cannot withstand firepower of that magnitude. Regardless of the ammo used, consider zip guns for short ranges only.
The making of a zip gun requires placing a cartridge into a tube and figuring out how to hit it hard enough that it fires. It’s very basic and very dangerous, and typically involves these parts:
a tube for use as a barrel, able to seat a firearm cartridge on one end
a striker capable of hitting the cartridge’s primer hard and fast, usually a screw or nail
some way to hold the zip gun (can also be the barrel)
guts and a few spare fingers
The character (not the writer, please) would seat the cartridge in the tube, then strike the primer with the striker. The latter might be built into a cap that slips over the tube to make it easier to use.
Custom Firearms
A big step up from zip guns are custom firearms. These can be made in any of three ways: by modifying an existing firearm, assembling one from manufactured parts, or creating one from scratch.
There are many legal “mods and builds” (mods is short for modifications; builds are firearms made from manufactured parts). Any firearm might be re-equipped for better grip, extra hardware, a bigger scope, and other performance enhancers. In recent years, the AR-15 rifle took the cake as the king of custom mods. I’ve listed many of those modifications in the previous section of this book.
Illegal mods used for fictional purposes usually focus on converting semi-automatic rifles into fully automatics. As stated earlier, such a conversion is illegal and difficult to do. Despite seemingly functioning in identical ways, semi-autos and full-autos require different hardware to function. There’s no switch you can throw to make the conversion. While writers can do what they please in fiction, reality suggests that a character would be better off buying a fully automatic firearm rather than trying to make one herself.
Another illegal mod seen in fiction is the shortening of the barrel of a shotgun by sawing it off. This allows a wider shot pattern at closer ranges. These sawed-off shotguns are illegal, but that wouldn’t stop a character in fiction. Feel free to go wild with that modification, but read the sections on shotguns to determine the disadvantages and misconceptions of sawed-offs.
Plastic Firearms (Including 3-D Printed)
Plastic handguns are typically used in fiction for characters slipping past a metal detector. That’s fine for fiction, but the reality is much different.
For starters, any plastic handgun is still going to need a metallic firing pin (a sliver of metal that strikes a cartridge’s primer—the part that ignites the gunpowder when hit). Depending on the metal detector, this small pin could pass or fail inspection.
Even if the plastic gun’s firing pin skipped detection, few people consider the ammunition. It will certainly contain metal, as ammunition made entirely of plastic doesn’t exist. There’s no getting around that. Thus the challenge to writers: How would a character get the ammunition past a metal detector?
The legality of plastic firearms is why this is all worth considering. The federal 1988 Undetectable Firearms Act (UFA) prohibits civilian possession and manufacture of firearms able to avoid metal detectors. The UFA can trace its origin to the introduction of the Glock 17 in 1982. The 17 broke new ground by incorporating several plastic parts into a high-performance design. This development led some to believe that a 100 percent plastic firearm was on the horizon. The UFA passed in 1988 in anticipation of that. Its passage certainly didn’t hurt the popularity of Glock handguns; in fact, it probably helped. The Act was set to expire in 2013 but was renewed at the end of that year through 2023.
The renewal passed in anticipation of yet another burgeoning technology in firearms: 3-D printed handguns. These are new to thrillers and crime fiction, as well as to the real world.
The parts for these firearms are “printed” using a machine loaded with moldable plastic. The organization Defense Distributed fired the first working model, the Liberator, in early 2013.
Despite being made of plastic, the Liberator is not the undetectable handgun of lore. It still contains a metal firing pin and uses metallic ammunition. Under what category it falls in the eyes of the UFA might depend on the federal government’s interpretation of “undetectable,” since lawmakers across the board are struggling for ways to govern this burgeoning technology. The proliferation of 3-D printers on the consumer market will make things even fuzzier in the years to come. When writing, forget the laws. This is an area largely unexplored by thrillers and crime fiction, or anyone for that matter. Have fun with it. For example, what would happen if a certain character—good or bad—could print a handgun at home? What about knives or other tools of destruction?
As far as performance is concerned, printed plastic weaponry has a long way to go. The field is too young to say whether it’s reliable, accurate, and safe to use. The fact that firearms manufacturers aren’t sprinting to the technology is in itself telling.
That said, I don’t believe that a 100 percent undetectable plastic handgun exists. If it does, I haven’t heard of it, and I’d bet that’s how its owner prefers things. Keep that in mind when assigning a plastic handgun to a character. A fictional world might employ reliably undetectable firearms, but it’s important to understand the reality of them, too.
