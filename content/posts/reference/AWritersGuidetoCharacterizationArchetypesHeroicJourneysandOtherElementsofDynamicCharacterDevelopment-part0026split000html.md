A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 20THE SNAKETRANSFORMATION, DEATH & REBIRTH
“The snake dwells in so many places, climates and environments, comes in so many colors, shapes and sizes that this creature can be said to be one of the most versatile of all. Indeed snakes represent versatility, transmutation and change, their natural inclination to “shed their skins” leaving behind the old, and adapting to the new, supports this idea.” —Zahir Karbani
In school, I had a friend who had an eight-foot snake for a pet. We were all in awe of it. I was able to touch it and wear it around my shoulders but I always had a feeling of fear when I did so. It was hard to connect with the snake. It didn’t offer the friendliness you might find in a dog or cat or even a squirrel. The snake was more independent minded, flicking his tongue about, trying to figure out if you were friend or foe. I’ll never forget the time my friend sat the snake down and pulled out a small animal to feed to it. I watched as a very primal scene took place that day.
My friend really loved that snake. His mom, on the other hand, brought out a kitchen knife whenever it was near. “Keep that thing away from me,” she said. Snakes evoke fear because they are hard to control. They can hide themselves at a moment’s notice, and what you can’t see, you fear.
