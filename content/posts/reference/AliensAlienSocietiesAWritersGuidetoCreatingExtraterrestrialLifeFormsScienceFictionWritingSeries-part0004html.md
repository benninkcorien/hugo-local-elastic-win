Book Title
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I have often thought that a book like this should exist, and I am grateful to Ben Bova and the folks at Writer's Digest Books for making it possible. Several people provided helpful input, including but not restricted to W.R. Thompson, G. David Nordley, Joan Slonc-zewski, Daniel Hatch and Robert R. Chase. I especially thank my wife, Joyce, for reading the manuscript and making valuable suggestionsâ€”and for her patience and support as the deadline drew nigh.
