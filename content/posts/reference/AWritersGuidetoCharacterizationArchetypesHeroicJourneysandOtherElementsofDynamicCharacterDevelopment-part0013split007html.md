A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can use bears to symbolically show hibernation, of course, but it’s always best to consider the props that will best suit your setting. For instance, in this example, you might infuse meditative, Zen-like qualities into certain settings in your story. The hero’s place will not be meditative, but some of the places the hero goes might be.
You can also suggest these qualities through the mood and tone of a scene. For instance, the hero’s dialogue can be very, very short and choppy. He may use words that are fast and phonetic and frantic, to reflect his life’s fast, fast pace.
Juxtapose the hero’s choppy dialogue with longer passages and flowery verbiage to show the opposite, more patient alternative. A love interest could mirror the hero’s fast-paced way by being very patient and also by giving him the benefit of the doubt. Or his love interest may be jumping to a conclusion against him and he finds himself confused wondering, “what the hell happened?” He starts seeing what its like to be on the receiving end of this kind of stuff.
The hero’s impatience can appear in the subtext of the dialogue. Things may be left unsaid because he’s in such a hurry to move on. Similarly, the character might be moving around the room, rushing here to there, picking up objects, and grabbing items and rearranging them to show his constant movement.
In the subplot, you might show another character who is trying to make a decision and can’t make one. Or you might have characters near to this character impatiently wondering “Did he decide yet, did he make a decision?!”
Somebody else at work might be going crazy waiting for the boss (hero) to make a decision. Or, it could be the hero’s best friend who needs to make a decision—maybe he is getting married and cannot decide what color the groomsman’s cummerbund should be and the inability to make such a small decision just drives the hero crazy. That’s one way of showing it.
With this kind of lesson, you will need a positive influence to demonstrate the benefits of patience and hibernation, and how these benefits don’t sap a person’s strength. The hero can meet someone who is patient. He needs to watch someone else retain their strength, without aggressiveness and without rushing and bullying their way through problems. Possessing that power in a way that is more balanced and more useful to him will allow him to make grounded, useful decisions.
