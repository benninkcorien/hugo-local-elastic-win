A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can show this by using symbols of feathers and fluttering things that symbolize air. Images of change, of going with the flow, going with the currents whether they be wind or water all produce an appropriate effect. Cleansing works here as well. As a symbol you might depict laundry hung up on a line with sheets blowing in the breeze. There are many ways to show transformation using air: going where the wind takes you, riding the currents of air, merging with nature in these ways. Consider the mood of the colors you present. The sky works well in this lesson because the hero is ascending to a more divine space, a higher space. Images of light, sunlight, the beach, and places that are open and inviting are also appropriate. Consider using sunflowers and objects that are hopeful. The dialogue can include subjects about looking forward or having optimism.
