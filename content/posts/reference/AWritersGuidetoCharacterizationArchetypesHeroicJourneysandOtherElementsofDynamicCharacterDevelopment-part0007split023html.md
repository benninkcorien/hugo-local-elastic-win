A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MATRIARCH AND THE MYSTIC
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two archetypes make a bad match. The Mystic values her private time and will not stand for the Matriarch’s demands on her. She may not voice her feelings but her actions will speak loud and clear, and drive the Matriarch crazy.
The Matriarch sees the Mystic’s private time as selfish and inconsiderate of others. If the family is going out now, then she must come now. End of story.
The Matriarch can teach the Mystic what it means to be in a family—she can show her the rewards that are born from the drawbacks. It’s a lesson in giving a little in order to receive. (For instance, the Mystic may have fun with the family even after she disputed having to adhere to the family’s schedule.)
The Mystic can teach the Matriarch that everyone in the family is an individual and should be respected as such —that everyone has his or her own flow and timing to life. Perhaps the Matriarch would like to take a moment alone?
