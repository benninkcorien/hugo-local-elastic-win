A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE FOOL
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
The Businessman cannot understand a man who can’t or won’t take care of himself. He may have had a difficult childhood, and when he’s around the Fool he is reminded of that.
The Fool can’t understand a man who would choose to be so strong, mental, serious, and responsible all of the time. He fights against the stereotype that men must be responsible breadwinners.
The Fool can teach the Businessman that it’s healthy and enriching to let go and play once in a while, that life can be fun and enjoyable.
The Businessman can teach the Fool the value of a good education and how to plan for the future.
