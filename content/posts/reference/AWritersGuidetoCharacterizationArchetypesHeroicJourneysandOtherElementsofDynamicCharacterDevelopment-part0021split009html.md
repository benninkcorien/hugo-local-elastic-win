A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
Because we all feel silly or abnormal about ourselves in some way, we can all relate to this character and the lesson she must learn. We all have things in our past that we might be ashamed of.
This lesson will resonate more when a conflict is related to it, but even on a small scale, any character can struggle with something in their past or a perceived flaw in the present that makes them feel different. Audiences like to watch characters who are learning how to accept themselves and their differences.
Ultimately, the more comfortable you are with who you are, the more good you will attract in your life. It all starts with radical self-acceptance.
