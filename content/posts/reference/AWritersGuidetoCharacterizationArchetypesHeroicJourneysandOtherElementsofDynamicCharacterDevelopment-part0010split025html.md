A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE MYSTIC
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and the AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. This is the same problem the Mystic has. She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. They can either try to help each other learn these skills, or they can stay in their inner worlds.
These two are alike in temperament, but they may be different in belief systems or training, like a Monk and a Wiccan Priestess or a Hypnotherapist and a Psychic. This is where they can clash depending on how well they accept other belief systems. Have they had the same spiritual experiences?
They both may not want to take the time to get to know each other.
