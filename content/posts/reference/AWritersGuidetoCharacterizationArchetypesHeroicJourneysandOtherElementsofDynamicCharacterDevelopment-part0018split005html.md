A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
In a successful resolution the hero discovers her natural ability. Sometimes when people of a minority race are held down, people of that race try to change who they are to become more like the more dominant race. They should instead learn to accept and love who they are and reach the highest level they can regardless of culture or race. This may be easier said than done which would elevate it to the level of plot taking up more space in the story than just the theme or message but we commonly see this theme in such stories.
