DRAMATIC SCENES
DRAMATIC SCENES
Quote: “Let your description unfold as a character moves throughout the scene. Consider which details your character would notice immediately, and which might register more slowly. Let your character encounter those details interactively.” — columnist, Moira Allen, editor of Writing World 
Deep POV just means painting a more vivid picture for your readers through your POV character. How they “see” the world and describe it for the readers is what gives a writer their own unique style and the character its “voice.”
When writing in Deeper POV, a writer should always include the five senses and other sensory details to make the scene very visual and more real for the reader.
Here are two different scenes of a girl walking through a residential neighborhood that were taken from one of my short stories. The first is written in a telling style (weak visual). Telling does convey the facts and details, but it does so in a flavorless and nondescript way. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please carefully study this longer example…
SHALLOW:
Andrea noticed that Elm Street looked deserted. The residential houses looked very quiet and unoccupied inside. There were no other people around her, and it made her feel uneasy.
She realized the sky was a very white color. Andrea was feeling more anxious as if someone was watching her. She walked quickly down the street and she heard the fallen leaves crunch.
She saw a woman hanging clothes on a line. The woman noticed Andrea walk by and lifted her head. Andrea could smell the scent of laundry. Andrea realized the smell reminded her of her mother.
“Hello,” Andrea said timidly.
The woman looked at her and she said coldly, “Good morning.”
Andrea saw big truck drive past with a gassy smell from the exhaust. It made her cough. Andrea looked around. She realized that the woman hanging the laundry was gone.
I need to get to Rachel’s house, she thought. Before they find out that I left.
She turned around and felt her body collide into a tree. She hurt her arm on a branch. She walked faster until she saw her best friend’s house further down the street. Andrea stopped and let out a heavy sigh of relief. Her friend lived near the high school. There was a lot of houses that looked the same.
Andrea heard a car turn the corner at a slow pace, and she suddenly felt scared so she ran to the house. She felt herself trip and fall down. She was feeling apprehensive when she stood up and then she tasted blood because she had bitten her lip.
Suddenly, the driver started to drive very fast toward her.
She got frightened and she ran to the porch, then she knocked on the door. “I need help!” she shouted fearfully.

Now please compare the next example revised with Deeper POV. And remember that applying any of the five senses to a scene will deepen the experience for the reader, and in some cases, even induce an emotional response. Also, try to include emotional reactions, internal-dialogue, and physical actions to spice up your descriptions and avoid a boring list of details.
DEEP POV:
Elm Street seemed deserted. The suburban homes appeared strange and silent, like houses in an abandoned ghost town. Andrea hurried down the sidewalk, her dirty sneakers crunching on the crisp autumn leaves. The sky was not cerulean, but milky and opaque, like a giant sink turned upside down.
She slowed her steps, a cold tremor racing up her spine. She glanced over her shoulder for the hundredth time.
Just get to Rachel’s house. No one is following you. They don’t know that you’ve escaped…
Her gaze darted left, then right. From someone’s backyard, a big dog barked, the noise echoing off the vacant-looking homes. Andrea quickened her pace, shoving her hands into the pockets of her winter coat.
A woman hanging clothes on a line, glanced up as she passed by, and the scent of fresh laundry and fabric softener polluted the air. Andrea smiled. The floral scent brought back memories of helping her mother with the housework.
“Hello,” Andrea said with a slight smile.
“Good morning,” the plump woman said, her tone cold and unfriendly.
A delivery truck rumbled down the tree-lined street, spewing noxious exhaust. Coughing, Andrea peered behind her again. The street remained empty. But the woman hanging laundry was gone.
Andrea turned so abruptly that her body smacked into a tree. The rough bark of the birch chafed the tender flesh of her arm.
Rubbing the spot, she quickened her steps until the house came into view. The tension in her shoulders slightly diminished. She was safe now. Her best friend only lived two streets away from the high school, but the walk felt like it had taken hours. The cookie-cutter house resembled all the others in the neighborhood, except for the shabby porch swing and the flaking yellow paint.
A car slowly turned the corner, and Andrea’s heartbeat ramped up. They had found her!
She sprinted toward the house. Tripping on a loose shoelace, she fell forward onto her knees. Shakily, she stood and ran her tongue over her lips, the coppery tang of blood filling her mouth.
The driver hit the gas and the car flew down the street, coming straight at her.
Dashing up the rickety steps, she pounded a fist on the door. “Help me, please!”

After reading the second scene, which do you think painted a more vivid picture for the reader?
Incorporating Deeper POV in your fiction writing is a great way of making any scene multi-dimensional.
Here are a few more examples of Deeper POV and how it applies to setting. The shallower sentences are considered telling the reader information by writing descriptions in a straightforward manner, which is fine on occasion if needed, but I want to inspire writers to dig deeper to make their fictional world as three-dimensional as possible.
Please take a look at these examples…
SHALLOW: I thought the forest looked tall and huge.
DEEP POV: Within the vast forest, the towering trees swayed in the breeze, their spindly branches waving hello.
SHALLOW: He noticed that the room was sparse and it felt cold.
DEEP POV: A chill shivered over his skin. The vacant room seemed lonely and unused.
SHALLOW: There were very tall buildings in this part of the city.
DEEP POV: The soaring buildings with their concrete heads in the clouds cast long shadows on the sidewalks below.
SHALLOW: The hillsides looked enormous and they had dry grass.
DEEP POV: The rolling hills resembled an endless expanse of balding grey heads.
SHALLOW: There was a bad storm coming.
DEEP POV: The horizon lit up with white light followed by the loud grumble of thunder.
SHALLOW: The night looked dark and it had a big moon.
DEEP POV: The darkness fell quickly like a shadowy blanket over the land and moonlight struck the sleeping homes like cold silver.
SHALLOW: There were big homes that looked affluent and expensively furnished in this area.
DEEP POV: The area was dominated by impressive mansions with fluted Corinthian columns on the lower and upper stories.

Here is another excerpt taken from my NA series, Sorority Row that shows writers how to describe a setting by adding sensory details through Deeper POV.
Please closely examine this “setting” example…
DEEP POV:
My new roommate and I were polar opposites. Her name was Vanessa Carmichael and she apparently guzzled energy drinks by the gallon, and her tousled copper hair looked like the “before” picture in a Pantene commercial. At least she seemed nice and normal. I wouldn’t have to worry about her doing anything weird like stealing my underwear or taking cell phone pictures of me while I slept to post on Instagram.
Our shared room was enormous compared to my old dormitory. Stevenson Hall had an ancient brick façade, but they’d remodeled the interior to create larger rooms. Apparently, not all dorm rooms resembled dank prison cells with painted cinder block walls. The rooms were more like an expensive apartment than regular campus housing. Even better, the dorms had single-gender floors.
While Vanessa talked a mile a minute, folded clothes on her bed, and sipped a Red Bull, I inspected her—incredibly cluttered—side of the room. I flicked a glance at the red poster with that lame phrase “Keep Calm and Carry On” in white lettering over her headboard. Vanessa had fastened a corkboard to the wall above her desk, pinned with snapshots of her high school debate team and blue ribbon awards for science and math. Piles of Old Navy hoodies and graphic shirts and bell-bottom cords were scattered on her dark green comforter.

After reading that last scene, did you notice how I weaved a combination of description, introspection, and “voice” into the narrative?
So instead of just describing something in bland detail, writers should try to lace in some of the five senses, emotional responses, “voice,” and action to make the description of a setting even more powerful and visual for their readers.
Please remember as you revise your own work that these are only guidelines and examples meant to help writers develop their own style in crafting dynamic settings and locations.
