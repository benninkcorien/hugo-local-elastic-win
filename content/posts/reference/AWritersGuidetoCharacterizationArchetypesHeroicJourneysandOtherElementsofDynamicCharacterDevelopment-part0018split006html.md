A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
An unsuccessful outcome occurs when the hero can’t open up enough to embrace his natural talent. The character allows other people to stop him from reaching the highest level. He doesn’t respect himself, or he doesn’t respect his skill and talent, and he is embarrassed about who he is. For these reason, he decides to stay where he is. Or if he does decide to go with his talent, he does not go as far as he needs to go to reach the highest level.
Someone of authority might keep him from getting the recognition he deserves. An example is a boxer who technically wins a fight, but because of the crazy point system, he is not awarded the win in the end.
