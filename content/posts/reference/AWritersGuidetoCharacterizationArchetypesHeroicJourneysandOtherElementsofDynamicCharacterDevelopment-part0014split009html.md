A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
This lesson draws a lot of interest because so many of us know a person (or people) who is cynical despite having much to be grateful for. We may even be that person, or if not, we have at least experienced a moment during which we felt this kind of cynicism. We may not want to admit to our cynicism, but we do like to think we are blessed more than we know and we need only to look a little deeper to see it.
It’s a Wonderful Life is such a popular classic because we can relate to sometimes feeling really bad about what’s going on in our lives until we meet somebody who is worse off than ourselves. It’s a universal lesson.
