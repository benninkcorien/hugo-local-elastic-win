A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
The hero provides other characters with freedom. For them, the pressure is off. They are free to move about the world and do whatever they need to do. This can feel odd because they are not used to having true freedom.
At first other characters might be a little hesitant, wondering if the hero means what he says or if he has ulterior motives. Eventually they’ll respect and enjoy the freedom the hero is attempting to give them, and they may be much more inclined to help and be involved in the hero’s quest.
