A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE MALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two archetypes don’t clash but there’s not much love between them either. The Male Messiah is not someone the Fool can rely on. The Male Messiah won’t have any vested interest in the Fool one way or the other, an actuality that puzzles the Fool, who is surrounded by people who try to control or change him.
The Male Messiah can teach the Fool to have a goal and see it through, and also to see himself as a spiritual who is having a human experience rather than a human being who is having a spiritual experience. He will value the Fool’s choices, knowing firsthand how hard it is to be different in this world.
The Fool can help the Male Messiah in many ways because he can move in and out of places without people taking much notice in him.
