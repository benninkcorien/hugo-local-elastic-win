A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Groundhog Day
An arrogant weather forecaster is annoyed when he finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, due to a snowstorm. He goes to bed and wakes up only to repeat the same day over and over again. He does everything he can to try to get out of his predicament but finally accepts his fate and does the best he can with it, learning to help others and try to make things better for all so he can repeat a better day over and over again.
The Hangover
A group of guys head to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wind up getting into the most outrageous trouble imaginable in order to try to find the groom when no one can remember what happened the night before. They face so many trials and feel like giving up but in many scenes they laugh at themselves and press on, not letting the intense panic and fear they each feel inside get them down or distract them from the task at hand. In fact, they go a bit too far and are punished for it.
Bridges of Madison County by Robert James Waller
Photographer Robert Kincaid wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson for four days in the 1960s. Her family is away, and she must decide if she will give up everything for love (see Tragic resolution below).
Arthur
Russell Brand’s character, Arthur, is out to have fun at all costs. Hobson (his nanny) enables his behavior. She enjoys the excitement and drama he brings to her life. She supports his foolishness in her actions while her words contradict what she does. If any hardship comes his way, he throws money and booze at it. He will not endure any of the pain of life. He takes pride in acting a fool and is willing to act stupid so other people will do things for him. When Hobson gets sick and passes away, Arthur has no choice but to grow up. His story moves in the opposite direction of most, from unsustainable foolishness to responsible foolishness. In the end he maintains that spark of innocence and love of life.
ET
An alien, stranded on earth, befriends a group of kids who try to help him get home. The little sister, Gertie, provides comic relief. She is a trickster who causes trouble and threatens to tell mom what is going on. She really just wants to be included.
