A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
A lot of other characters would support the hero in learning this lesson unless they are heavily invested in being responsible and proper.
Deep down, everybody wants to laugh and joke around, even in the worst of times. When hard times hit, and life is just too heavy and too much, everyone is grateful for a class clown who says something silly and lightens the mood.
Artistic characters are the kind who may want to delve deeper into their silly sides in an effort to see things differently. They tend to be overly intense in their pursuits, so that could be interesting to watch.
Here the hero needs to obtain the following skills:
   •  The ability to stop in the moment of pain, suffering, or despair or just a mishap
   •  The ability to step back
   •  The ability to see the bigger picture
   •  The ability to find something funny in the situation
