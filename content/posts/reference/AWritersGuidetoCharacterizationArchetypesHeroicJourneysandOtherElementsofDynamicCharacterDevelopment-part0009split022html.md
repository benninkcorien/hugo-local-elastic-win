A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE KING
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
The King is not a good friend for the Fool. The King will not put up with the Fool’s free lifestyle. If the Fool can’t find a job, the King will make one up for him.
The Fool can teach the King to loosen up, but doing so will take much effort and probably will not produce lasting results. If the Fool needs a break from the King, his best bet will be to hide out.
The King can teach the Fool responsibility, but along the way he may aggravate the Fool so much and make him feel so misunderstood that the Fool wants to go to work just to get away.
