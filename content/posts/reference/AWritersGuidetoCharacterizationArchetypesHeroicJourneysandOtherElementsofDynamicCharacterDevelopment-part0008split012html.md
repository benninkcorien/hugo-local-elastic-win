A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE ARTIST
   •  Loves to create and change things, instinctual, full of passion, intense, street-smart. A good example is Marlon Brando’s character in A Streetcar Named Desire.
   •  As a villain, the Artist becomes the Abuser who’s only out for revenge. He’ll never let it go.
