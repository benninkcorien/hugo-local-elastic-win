CHARACTER VOICE
CHARACTER VOICE
Quote: “Clichéd, superficial characters are the mark of a poor writer. A great character can save an overly simplistic plot, but no amount of action will make up for unbelievable or shallow characters. A good character has the same kind of depth, complexity, and believability as an interesting person.” —author Magdalena Ball
Like I mentioned in the last chapter, realistic “voice” is the characteristic speech and thought patterns of your narrator, like a persona. Because voice has so much to do with the reader’s experience of a work of literature, it is one of the most important elements in any piece of writing to create three-dimensional characters.
I have included two scenes to show writers the difference between “voice” and bland narration. The first one has shallow writing with lots of telling and hardly any “voice” or sensory details. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the obvious areas of shallower writing, but see if you can easily spot it.)
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
Sam Harrington heard the door open and he looked up from his comic book where he worked at the Book Shark. He saw a fat man with brown hair and eyes and a big nose walk into the bookstore. Sam noticed that the man was wearing jeans with socks and sandals and a T-shirt. He watched him walk past the bookcases and then he went toward Sam.
“Can I help you?” Sam asked in curiosity as the man approached.
“Here to pick up my book,” he said loudly. “My name is McGrath.”
“Sorry, this week’s order hasn’t come in yet. Do you wanna give us a call next—” Sam started to say but McGrath cut him off, so he stopped talking. (None of this is needed at the end of the dialogue.)
McGrath leaned across the counter and Sam thought he looked very angry.  “What do you mean my book is not here in the store?” he asked raucously.
Sam opened his mouth to respond but stopped. He was nervous because the man was so furious and Sam didn’t know what to do.
McGrath’s face looked red and he tried to relax. “Where is my book?” he repeated more calmly.
Now, this second scene has been rewritten to clearly reveal “voice” in the speech, internal-thoughts, and the narrative, and it even shows a Deeper POV.
Please compare this revised example…
DEEP POV:
It was a slow day at the Book Shark. Sam Harrington stood at one end of the bookstore in the self-help section, stuffing last week’s shipment of books onto the shelves.
The bell over the door chimed and Sam glanced up. A waft of car exhaust and brewing coffee from the Starbucks next door entered the room as the door creaked opened.
A customer entered the shop and maneuvered around the bookshelves with a heavy limp. When Sam caught a glimpse of the man’s clothing, his eyebrows rose. It was the middle of summer and the guy had on jeans with socks and leather Birkenstocks. Crazy.
Sam hurried past a pimply teenager sitting on the floor, reading a book and an old lady with blue hair—well, it looked blue—scanning the covers of the romance novels on sale.
Sam walked behind the counter and faced the new customer.  “Can I help you, sir?”
“Here to pick up my book,” the man said in a gruff tone. “Name’s McGrath.”
“Sorry, this week’s order hasn’t come in yet. Do you wanna give us a call next—”
“Whaddya mean my book didn’t arrive?” The stocky man leaned over the glass counter, and glared at Sam. His dark brown hair fell into his beady hazel eyes, and McGrath pushed the strands aside with a pudgy hand. He lowered his head, and blew out a breath soured by stale beer and cigarettes.
Sam’s shoulders slumped. Great. Another pissed off customer. It’s not my fault the shipment is always freaking late.
McGrath straightened, tugging at the collar of his faded Aerosmith T-shirt as if in an attempt to collect himself. His bulbous nose twitched. “Now. Where’s my book on ritual human sacrifices, boy?”

Each example presents the same scenario, but how the character relates it to the reader and the way the scene is shown through the words used to convey the character’s reactions and views is what reveals “voice.” The first one is telling the reader in a bland way, but in the second version, we get a glimpse of the character’s unique personality through Deeper POV.
“Voice” can add an extra layer of characterization to any novel, and it can avoid making your character seem like the dreaded Mary-Sue type.
Yes, writing with Deeper POV and “voice” often adds more words to your prose, but it is far more interesting and reveals a character’s personality aka “voice.”
Let’s use another example in order to clarify what I mean. Here’s a snippet from my science fiction novel, LOST IN STARLIGHT, before revision (no “voice”). The heroine has lost her cell phone and she suspects that the new guy at school has stolen it. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please study and compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
The next day, I go past my typical lunch table. I disregard my friends as they watch me I walk across the cafeteria. I am furious with Hayden Lancaster. I had no phone last night and I felt weird without it. This is the first chance I’ve had all day to talk to him. If I’d known where Hayden lived, I would’ve gone to his house in anger last night.
How did he take my iPhone? He must have removed the device from my purse while I was talking to Devin, I thought.
Viola sees me walk by, and says silently, Where are you going? And I point a finger in Hayden’s direction.
I notice sunlight shines through the windows. I smell pizza and I hear the sound of a soda can opening
Hayden is sitting alone with a bowl of pasta. Two drumsticks are near the bag. I’m still so infuriated with him. I see that he is wearing pants and a black shirt.
I set my lunchbox on the table and then sit down. I hear the loud sound it makes and see how it causes people to look at us, but it doesn’t bother me.
“Where’s my phone?” I ask angrily.
I watch Hayden sit back. “What’s up, Emo Chick?” he asks casually.
“Emo? Really?” I say with irritation.
I watch him look at me in my outfit. Why is he staring at me like that? What is wrong with my fashion sense?
“Okay, then, Goth Girl,” he says flippantly.
I hate stereotypes, I think to myself.
DEEP POV (“voice” and characterization):
The next day, I bypass my usual table at lunch, ignoring my friends and their curious stares as I storm across the cafeteria, swinging my Monster High lunchbox like a weapon. I have an animalistic urge to destroy Hayden Flippin’ Lancaster. Being without my phone all night felt like I was missing an actual limb. I even tried calling my cell, but no one answered.
This is the first chance I’ve had all day to confront him. If I’d known where Hayden lived, I would’ve been kicking down his door last night.
I just don’t know exactly how he managed to steal my iPhone undetected. But he must’ve snatched it out of my purse when my back was turned while I was talking to Devin in the hallway. I should’ve expected this when I stupidly blabbed about filming his epic dog rescue.
Viola watches me march past, mouthing: Where are you going? And I stab a finger in Hayden’s direction.
Super Boy thinks he’s so smart. Well, he’s just met his Kryptonite!
Sunlight trickles through the windows, dancing over the tables and the tacky orange chairs. The nauseating odor of greasy pizza wafts from the kitchen area, and the hiss of a soda can opening resonates throughout the crowded space.
Hayden’s sitting alone with his sack lunch and a plastic bowl of pasta. Two grungy drumsticks rest against the bag. Guess where I’d like to stick those. I try not to think about how hot he looks in urban decayed pants and a black V-neck shirt. He might be the silent, stoic type of man candy, but I’m about to crack his tough guy shell.
I drop my lunchbox on the table with a bang and slide onto an empty seat. The clatter draws attention, but I don’t care about making a scene.
“Where’s my phone?” I demand.
Hayden nonchalantly leans back and crosses his legs in that dude-esque, one ankle-over-the-opposite-thigh. “What’s up, Emo Chick?”
“Emo? Really?”
He checks me out from head-to-toe in my aquamarine dress with a white skull pattern, black knee-high socks, and riding boots. My cute Rock Rebel studded chain purse rests on one shoulder, and my hair is styled in a high ponytail. I am so looking glam-rock today!
“Okay, then, Goth Girl.”
Even worse.

Now one last piece of advice, I think even secondary characters should have a distinct personality that separates them from other characters.
The subsequent excerpt is taken from my new adult romance novel, SMASH INTO YOU, and it shows how even a secondary character has her own personality. Vanessa (the secondary character) has a very unique voice, as well as my spunky narrator.
Please closely examine this example with “voice” for both characters…
DEEP POV:
“…then I laughed so hard, I nearly peed in my hemp underwear…Hello? Are you even listening to me?”
I glanced up. “Oh. Yeah. Sorry. What were you saying?”
Vanessa pushed up her glasses. “You don’t care that I took the right side? Because I like being closer to the window and you came a day late—”
“It’s fine,” I said, shifting on my bed and lowering the novel I’d been reading.
My new home. This square, off-white room with its squeaky wooden floor only had two closets that barely fit all my clothes and shoes. My gaze swept over my side of the room, which resembled an ad from an IKEA catalog, decorated in girly pastel colors of turquoise, white, and pink, with two prints of Vincent van Gogh’s artwork gracing the walls. Over my headboard, I’d hung a string of twinkle lights.
I fluffed the row of pillows behind my head and stretched out my legs. I’d loved shopping for all my new stuff. My dad just handed over his credit card with a warning not to go too crazy. It allowed me to imagine a completely different life to go with my brand-new persona.
“If it’s gonna be an issue, I can move my stuff,” Vanessa said.
“I don’t care. Honest.”
Vanessa took a swig of her drink. She blinked her big owlish eyes behind square-framed glasses. “Awesome. My roommate last year was sooo picky. She was always borrowing my stuff without asking, and making out with her emo boyfriend…”
Chatty Vanessa would be my cellmate for the next year. Oh, yay. I already wanted to duct tape her mouth shut.

This additional chapter on “voice” should help writers to really understand how to depict a character’s distinctive personality within the narrative.
