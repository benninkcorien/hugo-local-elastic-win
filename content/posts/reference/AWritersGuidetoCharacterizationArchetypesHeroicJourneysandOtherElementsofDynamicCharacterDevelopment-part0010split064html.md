A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE MATRIARCH
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and LOVE, BELONGING, and RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to feel vulnerable to change, and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. The Matriarch can’t make him feel vulnerable.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits to her husband or family. With the King, she will be kept busy running their home as well as he runs their ‘business.’ She will take care of everything. In this way he may take her for granted, and he better change his ways because she will stand up for herself. He can only push her so far. Her marriage is important to her, and she won’t give up easily, but ‘home base,’ in whatever form, is her domain. He need be careful not to devalue her contribution to their partnership.
Deep down inside he knows she does a lot for him and he respects her for standing up to him. He takes her very seriously when she does, as he knows he must have done something wrong to get her so angry.
She respects the King’s space and knows he loves her, but she may do better with a more subservient man. On the other hand, a more powerful husband can set limits on her ‘queendom,’ thus stopping her from taking over the kids’ lives.
They are both so much alike that they clash often, but they also understand each other and may be the only other person to put up with the other. They can be best friends and truly respect each other—when they aren’t driving each other crazy.
