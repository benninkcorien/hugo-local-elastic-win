Special Forces
1
      Despite the unrealistic portrayal of Vietnam, it is something of a SF tradition that any Special Forces unit on a mission or training exercise has a copy of this movie in their traveling video library. SF soldiers respect the image of the Duke, and often show the movie to their foreign hosts.
2
      It appears that several overzealous reporters and producers from Time and CNN attempted to take the story of Operation Tailwind and fabricate a story that would gain them publicity and disgrace the Special Forces. When the truth came out and the story backfired, all concerned suffered appropriate professional punishment and disgrace, including firing for those most involved.
3
      Though the Marine Corps was formed in 1775, their acknowledged mission of amphibious assaults from the sea only dates from 1942. Though they have a history of raids and operations from the sea that dates back 225 years, their formal mission of amphibious warfare was only conceived in the 1920s and implemented during World War II.
4
      Title 10 of the U.S. Code lays out the requirements for personnel serving in various kinds of units. As of 1999, Title 10 restricts women from serving in frontline combat infantry units—the core of SOF forces today.
5
      I should note that Douglas MacArthur hated unconventional units, including the American OSS and the British SOE, SAS, and SBS, and did all he could to keep them out of his territory.
6
      The British SAS dates from the Second World War, when it served in North Africa against the units of Erwin Rommel’s Afrika Korps. Originally designed as a long-range reconnaissance and raiding force by its founder, Major David Sterling, it has evolved today into perhaps the world’s finest such unit. Man-for-man, it continues to be among the busiest and best-trained SOF forces, with capabilities in counterterrorism, reconnaissance, raiding, and other aspects of unconventional warfare.
7
      One of the primary shortcomings of Operation Eagle Claw, as it was called, was that all the services had to operate jointly to covertly transport the strike force to its target in Iran. The lack of long-range helicopters with in-flight refueling capabilities proved to be the most obvious of many weak links in the capabilities of America’s SOF community.
8
      One of the few SOF supporters was an Undersecretary of Defense, Noel Koch, who single-handedly kept elements of the community alive during the early years of the Reagan administration. Today, Koch is celebrated as one of the founding fathers of USSOCOM.
9
      “Black” units and programs are so secret that they are denied publicly, and do not appear in the funding documents submitted annually to Congress. Examples of such programs include the development of the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, and the founding of the Delta Force.
10
      Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) was chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee prior to his retirement, and Senator William Cohen (R-Maine) would become the Secretary of Defense in 1997.
11
      Because the USMC had encouraged special operations development, and had invested heavily in their own SOF capabilities, it was excepted from the Nunn-Cohen legislation and retained control of its Force Reconnaissance teams, as well as various SWAT teams and other units. Today, these are located within the seven Marine Expeditionary Unit, Special Operations Capable—MEU (SOC)—forces deployed worldwide. For more information on MEU (SOC)s and Marine Corps doctrine, see: Marine: A Guided Tour of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (Berkley Books, 1996).
12
      The term “ranger” has a dual meaning in the U.S. Army. For most Army personnel, Ranger training is an advanced course, which can be taken by virtually anyone in any branch of the service. The Ranger course is a physically and mentally arduous school, which is designed to toughen a soldier, and give him advanced training in combat skills, field craft, and small unit leadership. It is a tough course, with an extremely high dropout rate. Most of the men I know who wear the Ranger tab on their uniforms will tell you it was the roughest training they ever survived! The 75th Ranger Regiment is a formation composed exclusively of jump-qualified personnel who have also completed the Ranger training course. As such, they are an elite light regiment of shock troops, with few equals in the world.
13
      General Shelton’s father was given a 4-F (medically unsuitable) status during the Second World War; but his brothers were all able to serve with honor during the conflict.
14
      Project Delta was a unique SF reconnaissance unit formed and initially headed by Major Charles “Chargin’ Charlie” Beckwith, and based upon his own experiences during a tour with the British Special Air Service. Though wounded while extracting several SF soldiers from behind enemy lines, Beckwith survived and used his Project Delta to design and stand up the Army’s antiterrorist (Detachment Delta or Delta Force) in the late 1970s. Project Delta teams, along with other special SF units, provided much of the muscle to the clandestine Military Assistance Command—Studies and Operations Group (MACV-SOG) in the 1960s, as America’s commitment to South Vietnam grew.
15
      A Viet Cong invention, Pungi Sticks—sharpened sticks about the diameter of a finger—were designed to maim enemy soldiers walking through heavy ground cover or rice paddies. The sticks were grouped into fields or belts around terrain that was to be denied to an enemy, or emplaced in hidden holes that a soldier could stumble into. Both sides used Pungi Sticks as a defensive or ambush measure.
16
      General Edward Burba was one of a handful of senior officers, like Don Starry and Fred Franks, who helped hold the Army together in the 1970s and rebuild it in the 1980s. Such officers helped get the Army ready to fight the battles that would come with the end of the Cold War. For more on this, see my book with General Fred Franks, Into the Storm (Putnam, 1998).
17
-18 FOB Cobra was a huge logistics and operations base that was established over a hundred miles into Iraq at the start of the ground war in February 1990. Completed in a matter of hours, the move to FOB Cobra remains the largest and most difficult airmobile operation of all time.
18
      Task Force Normandy was assigned to take out a pair of Iraqi radar sites (Objectives Oklahoma and Nebraska) that might have detected Allied strike aircraft headed into Baghdad and western Iraq. For more on the mission and on AH- 64 Apaches, see Armored Cav (Berkley Books, 1994).
19
      To support the planned invasion of Haiti, the Navy removed their aircraft from a pair of Atlantic Fleet carriers and loaded aboard helicopters from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the aviation brigade of the 10th Mountain Division. Though controversial at the time, the operation was highly successful, and remains an option today.
20
      Fort Bragg is home of the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division, and SOF is headquartered there.
21
      The total Special Forces community numbers approximately 10,000. These days, about 1,000 leave that community every year, while something like five to six hundred replacements are now being trained every year. This deficit has been gradually slowed through better retention, but it still leaves ODAs as much as 25% to 33% under strength.
22
-24 Warrant officers’ MOS codes always have an “0” added.
23
      A number of foreign exchange military personnel are also recruited for Special Forces training. These soldiers (normally officers) are picked by their home governments, and training is provided by the U.S. government. They tend to be well-qualified for the SF trade, since a failure during training would reflect poorly upon their home country, military service, and government.
24
      Along with women, the Army will not allow the recruitment into Special Forces of military doctors or aviators. Since an impressive investment has already been lavished upon them, they are far too valuable to risk in an SF environment.
25
      Colonel Nick Rowe was a legendary Special Forces soldier. While serving in Vietnam, he was captured. After five years in captivity, he managed to escape and make his way back to friendly lines (a story eventually chronicled in the book Five Years to Freedom). A quarter century later, he was killed in the Philippines by a bomb set by insurgent forces.
26
      Because those in a soldier’s parent branch (armor, infantry, aviation, etc.) tend to view a Special Forces candidate as a “traitor” or malcontent, a failure to qualify frequently results in his leaving the service entirely. This is another reason why the SF leadership tries to make sure that the bulk of the dropouts or failures occur early, while there is still a chance for candidates to regain their position back in their home branch.
27
      The SFAS staff is very protective of their event parameters. When I asked for a general range of distances, they gave me a steely look and said, “Next question?” There were, I might add, no smiles.
28
      The courses for 180A (warrant officers), 18F (intelligence), and 18Z (operations) are handled elsewhere by the JFK Center and School, as follow-on qualification classes.
29
      “Pineland,” of course, refers to the marvelous pine forests of North Carolina. The SF staff uses the pine tree as a symbol for Robin Sage and other exercises.
30
      To show their appreciation for the civilian members of the Pineland Auxiliary, each ODA also does some work fixing fences and other chores around the private property used during Robin Sage. It is the Special Force’s way of saying thank-you to the civilian role-players, and is an excellent example of real-world winning of “hearts and minds.”
31
      Students tasked with learning these high-level languages are normally dispatched to the Defense Language School, which is located at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.
32
      I should mention that the Navy has some understandable complaints about the apparent duplication of efforts, but, in fact, the Combat Diver program maintains an important capability for the Special Forces.
33
      SF units are given a “Force Package One” status by the Department of Defense. Units with this priority status are normally kept at high alert levels, and thus will receive preference in the distribution of equipment and supplies. Thus SF units draw new gear and other Army inventory items ahead of all other units except the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and a handful of armored units.
34
      These loads were fairly extreme even by Special Forces standards, as the troops had to carry the building materials for their hide sites, along with all the other items required for their missions. A more “normal” load for an SF soldier on a mission might start out at around 110 lb./50 kg. This would allow for some mobility without literally tearing his body apart.
35
      The “myth” of the rucksack derives from the way SOFs go into battle: That is, they carry with them everything they’ll need. Today the old “rucks” are still used in training and qualification, not so much for their utility but because their use will remind trainees of their origins. The Rucksack magazine has been one of the more visible means of keeping old Special Forces traditions alive. The Rucksack is the product of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command Public Affairs office, and is dedicated to stories about SF personnel and their techniques of operating in the field.
36
      While it is an improvement over the backpacks used in Vietnam, the ALICE system is positively ancient compared with what can be bought out of any outdoors equipment catalog. More on its replacement shortly.
37
      If you are wondering why fielding new personal equipment takes so long, the responsibility lies with the Army’s equipment center at Natick, Massachusetts, near Boston. There every new piece of personal equipment from pocket-knives to boots is rigorously tested (sometimes to absurd standards). The good news is that gear issued to field units is normally excellent. The bad news is that equally excellent gear has been commercially available to campers and sportsmen for years before soldiers see theirs. Meanwhile, the Marines have benefited both from their smaller size and the willpower of their 31st Commandant, General Charles “Chuck” Krulak, USMC. Krulak made it a personal goal to get new boots, packs, and other gear for his Marines, and went to Congress himself to obtain the funds and authorization for them.
38
      This is not the silver tape that you buy at the hardware store. The military-issue “speed” tape is tougher with an adhesive surface that will stick to almost anything under virtually any condition, and is capable of standing up to wind loads of over 100 knots. For this reason, it is rated as an expedient airframe repair item. You can use it to patch bullet holes in the skin of helicopters so they can fly home for repairs.
39
      Technically, a carbine is a light, short, shoulder firearm, originally created to provide cavalry troops with a weapon that would be easy to stow and carry when mounted, but would give them the firepower of infantry when dismounted.
40
      Sometime around 2006, the Army and Marines will begin to field the new Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) as a replacement for the M16A2 and M4. This new weapon is being developed and produced by a team headed by Alliant Techsystems, and is based upon a Heckler & Koch design. It will be controlled by a state-of-the-art sighting and fire control system, which will become the primary sensor systems for the user.
41
      The U.S. Marine Corps maintains what may be the finest sniper capability among the world’s armed forces. They are equipped with both the 7.62mm M40 sniper rifle, along with the incomparable Barrett M82A1 .50 caliber weapon. More important, Marine snipers are employed in their chosen specialty full-time, while most other military units maintain snipers as an add-on capability. For this reason, the Marine sniper retains a much higher level of tactical skill and accuracy, especially when working at long ranges and in denied territory.
42
      There are efforts to field a new offensive handgun using either 9mm or .45-caliber ammunition, but this is years from fielding.
43
      American World War II-era grenades were designed to fragment for maximum antipersonnel effect. This was achieved by serriating the external case of the weapon, which gave it the famous “pineapple” look.
44
      TNT is also the measure of all other explosive pyrotechnics. Thus nuclear weapons are measured in kilo- and megatons of TNT.
45
      In all fairness, we should not forget that the bomb hit the point where it was aimed (it went to the right address), but it turned out that Intelligence was wrong about what was at that address.
46
      There is, however, a hope that the Army will produce foods to “spice” the urine to make it mimic a “local” cuisine and thus foil tracking (stealthy urine).
47
      “Digital Soldier” is an Army marketing term used to describe the new ensemble of gear that will be carried by the infantry in the early twenty-first century. This will include a central processor/communications/navigation package to keep the soldier in touch and oriented at all times. There will additionally be a new helmet-mounted heads-up display to show digital maps, sensor readouts, and other data, and will leave the soldier’s hands free for weapons. Though “Digital Soldier” promises to be an impressive array of systems, it is unlikely that Special Forces will choose to adopt it anytime soon. The complexity and weight will likely keep them using more “basic” but dependable systems until the second (and hopefully bug-free) generation of “Digital Soldier” technology arrives.
48
      It should be noted that not all death squads came from right-wing sources. Recent evidence shows that the left had their death squads, too, the best known of their actions being the massacre of a Catholic priest and several nuns. This raised up a serious stir when it happened.
49
      John Singleton Mosby was the famous Southern cavalry officer who established a force of rebel raiders (primarily composed of civilian irregulars) in the northwestern counties of Virginia. For several years they struck at Union supply and transportation lines and provided superb reconnaissance for Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. So effective were Mosby’s raiders that the areas of Loudoun and Prince William counties west of Washington, D.C., became known as “Mosby’s Country.”
50
      Most of the immigrants who became early Special Forces soldiers were given American citizenship under what was known as the Lodge Act. Named for its sponsor, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the bill gave the U.S. government the right to grant immediate citizenship to personnel from politically persecuted countries if they chose to serve in the U.S. military.
51
      The assault on Nam Dong became the basis for the John Wayne film The Green Berets. Though fictionalized, the situation presented in the film was accurate, as was the level of force the North Vietnamese used to attack the camp.
52
      It should be noted that the prisoners at Son Tay were treated somewhat better than they would have been at Hoa Lo. They were allowed to socialize and were expected to work in the local fields, which helped keep them more fit and sane.
53
      To assist the Son Tay raiders in familiarizing themselves with the POW camp and its surroundings, a large-scale model was constructed (at a cost of $60,000, code-named “Barbara”) by a special shop at the CIA. In addition, a collapsible full-scale model was built at Eglin AFB for dress rehearsals. Because the full-scale model could be dismantled, Soviet photo-reconnaissance satellites were unable to detect the training area or infer the mission’s target. Today, visitors can view “Barbara” at the Special Forces museum at Fort Bragg. (The museum itself, I should note, was recently renamed for Colonel “Bull” Simons)
54
      After the war, Texas computer magnate Ross Perot threw a party for the Son Tay raiders and the men they’d tried to rescue. Even as most of their fellow countrymen were turning their backs on Vietnam veterans, Perot wanted the raiders to understand how much the POWs and their loved ones treasured what they’d tried to do ... Flash forward to Iran, where several of Perot’s employees are held hostage during the Islamic Revolution. Who does Perot turn to for help? Bull Simons. Simons then led a force of Perot’s executives into Iran and, without loss or casualty, successfully retrieved the hostages.
55
      I should note that U.S. government buildings around the world have been getting “harder” as a result of the plague of terrorist bombings over the past two decades. Poor security and force protection have cost lives, and no military commander wants to be found negligent in such matters.
56
      While all SF units are “Airborne” units (every SF soldier must be fully jump qualified while on operational status), and properly so called, I’ll use the shorter version and refer to them simply as SFGs.
57
      The “c” in MRC will at times also stand for “crisis” or “conflict.” Contingency, crisis, or conflict, it’s all the same—BIG trouble.
58
      We last saw General Crocker as commander of the 82nd Airborne Division in Airborne (Berkley Books, 1997). He has since been promoted to lieutenant general, and given command of I Corps.
59
      1st SFG also maintains a single ODA in Korea, to support operations along the DMZ.
60
      Officially, Taiwan is not part of the regional 1st SFG operations plan. Because of the “One China” policy, which has since 1973 recognized the People’s Republic of China as the sole government of China, Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China) is something of a “nonnation.” Even so, the U.S. maintains extremely close military ties with the nationalist Chinese.
61
      “Balance” is the Department of Defense code word used to denote 1st SFG operations in PACOM. Every 1st SFG operation has a two-word designator, the first word of which is always “Balance.”
62
      Like the other groups, they trace their spiritual lineage back to the Devil’s Brigade; specifically, the HHC of the 1st Battalion of the brigade’s 1st Regiment.
63
      The move from Panama is a consequence of the U.S. turnover of the Canal Zone under the treaty negotiated in the 1970s by the Carter Administration.
64
      After writing this, I learned that Phillips has retired from the Army.
65
      Fort Carson is located on the south side of Colorado Springs. The city is also home to the Air Force Academy, Cheyenne Mountain/NORAD, and is the headquarters of U.S. Space Command.
66
      This is based upon the likelihood of a fast-breaking crisis in a relatively small theater. In addition, politics dictate that (as in Korea) we maintain a high level of readiness and posture in places like Europe that we really care about.
67
      “Total Force” is the U.S. military’s core-operating concept today: According to the “Total Force” concept, active-duty, reserve, and national guard units are equipped with the same equipment, given the same training, and able to fight together as a complete team.
68
      While the SOF heavy-lift capability is currently based with the 437th Airlift Wing at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, it will shortly move to McGuire AFB, New Jersey. And there is a good possibility that when the SOF-capable C- 141Bs are retired in a few years, a squadron of C-17 Globemaster IIIs will be modified to take over the SOF mission.
69
      The Special Forces grade the operational readiness status of a unit by the Green/Amber/Red scale. Green means mission ready, Amber means the unit is in training and getting ready to deploy, and Red signifies that the unit is just back from a deployment and needs leave and training.
70
      The data device is usually nothing more than a laptop computer or personal digital assistant, with the data stream going to the radio through a digital encryption device. This allows the sending of e-mail messages using commercially available software, a real benefit for the team members.
71
      SPACECOM is understandably frugal with the limited SATCOM resources available. Thus several SF missions in various parts of a region may have to share a single satellite channel or transponder, depending upon the urgency and importance of their tasking.
72
      For more on the JTFEX series, see Marine; Airborne; and Carrier (Berkley Books, 1996, 1997, and 1999 respectively).
73
      These exercises (known as Cooperative Nugget-95 and -97) provided NATO with an opportunity to look over the forces of various PFP nations, and evaluate their worthiness for membership within the Atlantic alliance. In 1999, three former PFP nations, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, became the latest additions to NATO.
74
      This facility was once the old England AFB, which had been home to a wing of A-10A Thunderbolts (Warthogs) that fought during Desert Storm. It was closed during one of the rounds of base closings of the early 1990s. Today, the base facilities have been commercialized, but the government still maintains some limited facilities (such as the JRTC marshalling yard) on the property.
75
      The BLU-82 was used during the Vietnam War to knock down tree and plant structures, creating an instant helicopter landing pad. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, BLU-82s were used to clear Iraqi minefields and terrorize enemy troops in conjunction with leaflet drops.
76
      For more on MILES and its use in force-on-force training, see Armored Cav and Airborne (Berkley Books, 1994 and 1998 respectively).
77
      At JRTC, the casualty/evacuation system sends each person judged as wounded by his or her MILES harness to a central receiving station near the post’s Army airfield. Here they are randomly given a card that assesses their wounds. Some can be “treated;” others are judged “dead.” The JRTC replacement system allows some of the “dead” to go back to their units and get back into the action ... but only if they are properly handled in the system by their home unit.
78
      While seemingly random, the ODA numbering system does have logic behind it: The first digit refers to the number of the ODA’s SFG. The second references its assigned company (there are nine per SFG). The last numbers the ODA within its company, from one to six. Therefore, the designation ODA 745 tells you that the team is assigned to the 7th SFG. 2nd Battalion/Company “A,” 5th ODA.
79
      Briefbacks are the final briefings just prior to mission execution. Frequently these will be used to hammer out final problems, set Rules of Engagement (ROEs), and other last-minute items.
80
      Special Forces E&Es are among the most classified of their many operational procedures. Even during exercises like JRTC 99-1, I was asked not to ask questions or obtain information about E&E procedures. I can say that SF E&E skills are an important part of their training, and are regularly practiced.
81
      The plan called for the 1/10th Mountain forward reconnaissance elements to enter the “box” at 1900 hours on the 7th, while the main elements planned to arrive at Carnis at 1300 hours on the 8th.
82
      During Vietnam, Viet Cong often used wounded American soldiers and Marines as “bait” to draw other forces into an ambush zone.
83
      The Blackhawk’s seats are designed to provide passengers with protection in the event of a crash landing; for that they work quite well. But during combat operations, SOF personnel usually like to remove them so they’ll have more room and can get rest on long infiltration flights. For JRTC 99-1, the 160th SOAR left the seats in as a safety measure (their usual practice during Stateside training).
84
      During planning, ODA 745 considered wearing what are known as “Gilly Suits” during the “hit.” These are camouflaged overgarments, designed to blend the wearer into local vegetation. Though later analysis indicated they might have proved useful, it was decided not to take them because of their weight and bulk (they can get very warm).
85
      It’s important in sniping to accurately assess ranges without using laser or other active rangefinding equipment. The techniques involve a lot of fieldcraft, and the result is normally accurate.
86
      An “artificiality” is a situation inherent in a model or a wargame that generates a result, but would never happen in real life. (Examples are range safety or limits on time when a range can be used.) The result can be good or positive and teach important lessons. Still, the end state created is artificial, and this must be understood by the participants and creators so as not to bias the final assessment and lessons learned.
87
      While it is technically part of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), which is based at Fort Stewart, Georgia, the 3rd/3rd Infantry (Mech.) calls Fort Benning, Georgia, home. Such distinctions are common in today’s Army, where various parts of larger units can be located literally thousands of miles/kilometers from each other.
88
      Before Operation Desert Storm, critics of American made weapons prophesied that the heat and dust of the Persian Gulf would cause our weapons to fail. In fact, every military specified system in service—tanks, helicopters and trucks; radios, rifles, and computers—had been tested at YPG and other test facilities. They all worked in the desert. Part of the high cost of military systems is due to the process of “ruggedizing” and testing to make them function anywhere, from the Arctic to the Sahara.
89
      YPG has an exceptional record of protecting the acreage under its control. So effective has been its stewardship that the facility recently won the Department of the Army Environmental Award as the post with the finest environmental record in the service.
90
      The 11th ACR is the famous “Blackhorse Cav,” which spent the Cold War watching over the critical Fulda Gap in Germany. After the end of that conflict, they were for a time disestablished; but were later reflagged as the NTC OpFor. They also retain a wartime mission as a normal ACR. For more Blackhorse lore, see Into the Storm, written with my good friend General (Ret.) Fred Franks (Berkley Books, 1997).
91
      The idea is to create names that participants will never run into again, but are easily remembered.
92
      For more on NTC, see Armored Cav (Berkley Books, 1994).
93
      The assault landing is a specialty of the C-130 Hercules transport: A fully loaded C-130, with all its flaps down, comes in to land literally hanging on its props. Once the aircraft hits the ground, the turboprops are reversed, and the Hercules stops after a rollout as short as 1,000 ft./305 m. The aircraft is then rapidly offloaded (sometimes it does not even stop), and then takes off in much the same way as it landed. Though the C-17A Globemaster III can make similar landings, the wisdom of using a jet transport costing $250 million a copy in a high-threat area is questionable.
94
      Each gallon of water weighs about 8 Ib. Even with a consumption of just a gallon per day, on a six-day mission, each SF soldier would have to carry almost 50 Ib. of water ... and containers. In fact, the Army standard for soldiers in a desert environment is a minimum consumption of two gallons per day.
95
      “Maggie LaLouch” (her real name is Margaret) is a civilian JRTC employee on the Fort Polk Public Affairs staff, and the wife of a JRTC range operator. She is a bright, talented lady who takes seriously her role as the “Media OpFor,” and works hard to teach officers how not to give reporters openings they don’t deserve.
96
      In late 1995, following Operation Deliberate Force (a short bombing campaign against the Bosnian Serbs), the various warring factions in the ongoing Bosnian civil war met at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton to craft an agreement to settle the war. The terms of the agreement included a withdrawal of military support by the Serbs and the Croats, a partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina into ethnic/religious zones, and a multinational peacekeeping force to enforce the whole arrangement. The three primary nations in the peacekeeping force are the U.S., Britain, and France, though dozens of others—including Russia—have contributed units.

      General Montgomery Meigs is the latest in a string of Army general officers from one of the first families of the Army. His namesake, Abraham Lincoln’s quartermaster general during the Civil War, commandeered Robert E. Lee’s Virginia home to create the current-day Arlington National Cemetery. The present General Meigs, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, where he commanded an armored brigade against the Republican Guard, is a specialist in the arcane science of operations research and an excellent historian and writer.

      Many nations maintain a National Guard—really, a National Police Force—which functions as a combination of the U.S. F.B.I., Treasury Department, State Police/Militia, and military reserve.

      The Army facility is Camp Doha, north of Kuwait City. The Navy facility is in Bahrain. And the Air Force is now at Al Karj (Prince Sultan Airbase, home of the 4th Wing during the war) in Saudi Arabia (it was once at Dhahran).

      The four KLF brigades are laid out as follows: The 35th Armored covers the western border with Iraq; the 26th Cavalry holds the north. The 15th Armored Brigade is assigned the central region of the country; and the 6th Infantry (Mech.) defends Kuwait City.

      At one time, especially during World War II, sniping was a Russian specialty. In later years, the Dragonov SVD was among the finest sniper rifles in the world, and was especially feared in Vietnam, where its accuracy and hitting power in the jungle was impressive. Now, with its wooden stock and bed (as opposed to the fiberglass and composite units common in western designs) and poorly made sights and triggers, the SVD is somewhat dated. With the SVD, hitting targets at long ranges (greater than 547 yds/500 m) is almost impossible. Inside of 438 yds/400 m, however, it is still a useful and deadly weapon.

      All the law enforcement, intelligence, and military functions are conducted inside rooms that are essentially metal vaults. These can be locked and secured in the event of an attack or seizure, and are the last shelter in such an event.

Relampago Rojo is Spanish for “red lightning,” a reference to the 7th SFG’s Latin American mission, and their unit colors, which are primarily red.

      For more on JTFEX operations, see Marine (1996), Airborne (1997), and Carrier (1999). 107 These units would find themselves embroiled in Operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia within weeks of JTFEX 99-1. Later, the 26th MEU (SOC) would become the lead peacekeeping element of Operation Joint Guardian in Kosovo.

      In December, I decided that the 1/7 SFG’s operations at Fort Polk would be a better event for me to observe than the 20th Group’s SCUD hunt at Eglin AFB, which would have been more difficult to cover and included classified elements that would have been denied to me.

      The nomenclature “Commander, Task Force” (thus: CTF) is standard. I have no idea why it is used.

      PowerPoint is a computer-based program for mastering and presenting briefing slides. Easy to use and quite powerful, PowerPoint has become a staple for American business and military personnel trying to get their message across. More recently, all NATO briefings during Operation Allied Force were presented in PowerPoint, including video clips and photographs.

      Because R3 went ‘round the clock, breakfast was the only meal that overlapped a shift change for the Battlestar personnel. Colonel Phillips therefore designated this as the main meal of the day, and his food preparation personnel did their best to make it special. Most days, they had eggs to order or pancakes, as well as biscuits and gravy, breakfast meats, fruit, and excellent coffee. This also was the time when Battlestar personnel could pick up their midday meal, an MRE.

      If you think this sounds like recent headlines, you are right. Operation Marauder came very close to running exactly like a real-world ethnic cleansing/repatriation event in, say, Rwanda or Kosovo. Plan on seeing a lot more of these in the years ahead.

      Though R3 was held on the JRTC live-fire range, all engagements were conducted by personnel wearing MILES gear and firing blanks. The only live ordnance used were illumination rounds and some demolitions for clearing obstacles.
