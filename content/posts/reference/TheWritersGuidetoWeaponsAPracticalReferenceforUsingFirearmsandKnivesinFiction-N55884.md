Bonus Download: Exhaustive Weapons Listings
Looking for a quick way to research firearms and knives? Be sure to get the exhaustive firearm and knife listings download available at www.WritersDigest.com/guns-knives [inactive]. It’s the essential companion to this guide.
The download contains firearms cataloged from 1873 through today, organized by type and year introduced. Find ammunition capacities, historical trivia, manufacturing dates, and more. I highly recommend this download for selecting a character’s firearm.
Many common knives on the market today are also included in the download. Use it to get an idea of what’s available.
The download is free and exclusive to those who purchased this guide. Don’t miss it.
