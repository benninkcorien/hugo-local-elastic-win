A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Supporting characters may be negative about the hero pursuing this lesson because he is trying something new and different. No one knows if his idea will work and some characters might want to be the voice of reason. If the hero ends up being wrong, then they can be right and not be held accountable for the negative consequences.
So they will automatically take the opposite side and have a fifty-fifty chance of getting praised for taking a stand. The hero will be praised if he’s successful, and some characters will be jealous of his clever idea and bravery to carry it through. They wish they were able to come up with ideas like that.
Specific skills the hero might need to work on include being observant, being creative, brainstorming ideas, and finding a connection between different objects. The hero can study different art forms and different philosophers and ideas. He should be open to new concepts and the possibilities of how two things can be combined to create a third thing. The hero must have the skill to stop and observe quickly because usually he’ll be under strict time constraints.
