Matching a Firearm to a Character, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Matching a Firearm to a Character
It’s important to match a character to an appropriate firearm. Assigning something disproportionate to the character could turn off readers. Once the firearm is selected, accurate depictions become a lot easier to write.
Here’s the step-by-step way to do it. Some writers start with the gun, but I think it’s better to start with the character.
1. Determine the Role of the Character
What does the character do in the story? Is he or she a law enforcement officer? A spy? A lowlife at a bar? A bad guy knocking off a gas station?
The role will determine the context of everything else. Start there. For example, you wouldn’t give an M16, a machine gun available exclusively to the U.S. military, to a Girl Scout on a squirrel hunt.
2. Identify the Physical Attributes of the Character
Hand size is an important part of matching a character to a firearm. A hand too small for a firearm, as in this example, will have trouble pulling the trigger. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
If a character can’t wield the firearm in the first place, there’s little chance he will use it. That’s why it’s important to identify the physical attributes of the character.
There are infinite variables, but here are the three biggies.
How large are the character’s hands? Can they easily grip the firearm?
What is the age of the character?
Is the character feeble or fit?
Maynard Soloman, for example, is somewhere north of eighty years old, is out of shape from all that RV driving and gas station food, has arthritis in every joint in his body, can’t stand for longer than five minutes at a time, can’t feel anything below the belt, can’t hear out of his left ear, and suffers from terrible vision.
“But other than that, I’m perfectly capable of shooting a gun,” Maynard says. “I don’t even need the earplugs. Can’t hear anything anyway.”
Consider all of these things when assessing your character’s ability to handle a firearm.
3. Assign a Firearm Type
From Grandma to the Green Berets, you can find a firearm to suit anyone. In this step, break down the firearm types into rifles, shotguns, pistols, and revolvers. Apply all you know about a character’s attributes, role, age, and location before selecting a general firearm type.
For example, police officers are likely fit enough to carry even the larger rifles and shotguns, but due to their occupation, they will most likely carry a semi-automatic pistol as their weapon of choice.
An assassin might have a sniper rifle, complete with a suppressor. If the target will be up close, he or she may opt for the kind of sidearm that hides in a holster on the body, so think smaller, slimmer pistols.
Maynard is feeble and has smaller hands, so a simple compact revolver might be up his alley. Then again, he might keep a shotgun handy in his RV for emergencies.
4. Choose a Caliber
It’s tempting to outfit a character with the biggest, baddest firearm possible. That little devil on your shoulder is Hollywood whispering into your writerly subconscious. As the Ten Golden Tips for Writing Weapons pointed out, Tinsel Town usually gets guns wrong.
Hits are all that matter in a gunfight, real or fictional. So when assigning a firearm or caliber to your characters, match it with respect to their physical attributes.
Physically small or frail characters will do best with lighter calibers (i.e., those with less firepower).
Medium-build characters might choose those lighter calibers or the midpower ones. In exceptional cases, high-powered calibers could also be assigned.
Large or strong characters can use anything. As the writer, you may want to take advantage of their brawny characteristics to assign a high-powered caliber.
As far as the specific calibers go, use this cheat sheet arranged from smallest to largest. Many calibers and cartridge configurations are out there, but the following information offers a solid base to work from when writing.
Pistol and revolver calibers, least to most powerful: .22, .25, .32, .38, 9mm, .40, 10mm, .357, .45, .44, .50
Rifle calibers, least to most powerful: .17, .22, .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, .30-06, 7mm, .338, .50
Shotgun gauges, least to most powerful: .410 (this is actually written as a caliber, not a gauge), 20, 16 (uncommon), 12, 10 (uncommon)
5. Select the Actual Firearm
With the type and caliber selected, browse the firearm suggestions in this guide for possibilities. If you are still unsure, research other resources that might help you.
Do a little digging into a firearm’s specifications, history, year of introduction, and background, including any applicable laws. Is it likely the character would have access to that particular model?
6. Get the Specs
Finally, make a note of the firearm’s finer details. What kind of action does it use? How many rounds can it hold?
Putting the Steps Together
Going through the steps above will yield the right gun—or at least point you away from an unrealistic option. Here are my examples.
Name: Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective
Character’s Role: exceptionally arrogant and equally ignorant private investigator living in a dilapidated RV
Physical Attributes: frail octogenarian of medium build—except for his large gut
Firearm Type: revolver
Revolver Caliber: Maynard is in rough shape, so the light firepower of a .22 seems like a good match.
The Gun: A search of .22 revolvers drew my attention to the Charter Arms Target Pathfinder. Maynard is no Annie Oakley, and the description says this is a gun for novice shooters.
The Specs: This revolver weighs 20 ounces and holds six rounds. That’s good to know, because Maynard is an awful shot. And he’s just been hired to track down prescription painkillers reported as “stolen.”
Name: Bill Robber
Character’s Role: Bill runs a cartel that smuggles illegal pogs into the United States. Pogs ceased being popular in the 1990s, but Bill isn’t the brightest bulb. Due to his paranoia, Bill needs to be ready to crank out a lot of ammunition in a short amount of time.
Physical Attributes: Bill is average on all physical fronts, although his brainpower is limited.
Firearm Type: submachine gun
Submachine Gun Caliber: Bill says he could handle a .44.
The Gun: Some research reveals that the .44 isn’t a caliber commonly offered in submachine guns. The 9mm is popular, so let’s switch things up and go with that. The Heckler & Koch UMP is offered in 9mm, so Bill will use that one.
The Specs: The fully automatic Heckler & Koch UMP packs thirty rounds of 9mm ammunition. Those rounds will go quickly, so Bill will need to do a lot of reloading.
Name: Penny Flyswatter
Character’s Role: Penny is a SWAT team officer about to storm an illegal pog-smuggling operation.
Physical Attributes: Penny is in top physical condition and has extensive firearms training. No firearm will be a problem for her.
Firearm Type: If Penny has to storm a house and shoot, it’ll be in close quarters. Shotguns are devastating at that range. She’ll use one of those.
Shotgun Gauge: A 12-gauge packs a nice punch, so let’s go with that.
The Gun: A check of firearms listings shows that the Benelli M4 Tactical looks promising. However, it was introduced in 2006, and Penny’s story is set in 2005. So the Benelli M2 Tactical, a similar model introduced in 2005, makes a better fit.
The Specs: The Benelli M2 holds five rounds. That’s not a lot, but it’ll do for the story. Based on research, SWAT officers often use extended magazines for their shotguns, allowing additional rounds to be held inside the firearm. That can be written in, if necessary, but shouldn’t become an issue unless more than five rounds are specifically fired in the story.
Remember the Escape Route
If a character’s firearm simply can’t be determined, write around the weapon. Go generic.
Instead of assigning that six-shooter Charter Arms Target Pathfinder to Maynard, he might just use a generic “revolver” instead. It’s not as fun to go generic, but it’s passable. The depictions need to be equally generic and consistent. It’s best to back up even mundane depictions with research.
