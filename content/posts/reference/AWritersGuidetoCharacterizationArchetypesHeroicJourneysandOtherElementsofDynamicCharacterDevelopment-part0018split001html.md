A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE DOLPHIN’S CHARACTER ARC
In this arc, the hero is learning to be the absolute best, at the top of his game, in some area of his life. Striving to be the best is the focus of the plot. The story might be based on the development of a skill, it might be based on striving to break a record, and it might be about reaching the peak of spiritual enlightenment.
An example is a story about a baseball player who wants to transcend what other players have done before by hitting sixty home runs in one season.
The dolphin is at the highest level which is really a natural ability and a natural state that we have forgotten. We put all these masks on and all the ego stuff that separates us and makes us operate or think we are much less than we are. So this lesson is not only about this character practicing in order to achieve some goal, but about his becoming more of who he naturally is by developing his talents and instincts.
You might have a character who is pressured to play soccer. He is practicing, practicing, practicing, and trying to develop his skills, trying to be the best player he can be, but it’s still not happening for him. On the other hand, if he concentrates on his natural ability to play the violin, he very quickly becomes one of the best violin players in the world. This is because playing violin comes naturally to him. It is his true nature and he can reach the top of his “game.”
