A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER AND THE NURTURER
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two women don’t see eye to eye at all. The Father’s Daughter will outwardly or subconsciously devalue the work that the Nurturer does. She wants to make it in a man’s world, and nurturing is the first thing she must suppress in board meetings.
On the other hand the Nurturer may see the Father’s Daughter as cold and unloving. She can’t understand why she wants to go to the office every day. She enjoys caring for others. She may outwardly or subconsciously see her role as one that contributes more to society than anything the Father’s Daughter will ever do.
The Nurturer can teach the Father’s Daughter how to think about the people she’s affecting with her work—for good or bad.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Nurturer that being smart and accomplished can sometimes lead to running a company—and that running a company can help more people than giving all your time to one person.
