A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 5ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
Why are romantic relationships important?
If you want to build a story that will touch readers on a personal yet universal level, you need to add the element of love. Everyone longs for love on some level, and the best films and novels deal with the subject in one way or another.
All great books, movies, and entertainment have some sort of romantic theme running through them. Sometimes it is unrequited love. Sometimes it is passionate yet tragic love. Love is universal. It is something everyone desires, regardless of what they may say.
Keep in mind that many writers know how to write about the longing for love or unrequited love—great literature is filled with it—but the task of writing characters who have found love is much more difficult.
   •  How do they express their love?
   •  Who falls in love first?
   •  How will their relationship affect the rest of the story?
   •  Does the heroine’s love for another effect or change her?
   •  Will they be together in the end?
As an author, you have several decisions to make up front regarding sex and love in your story. You may decide they have no place whatsoever in your story and that is fine, not every story has to have them. But writing about love and sex is still a skill every writer needs to learn. They are basic human functions, and love is a desire all your readers deal with in their daily lives.
Even action films include love in the subtext. Perhaps your hero is in love with a woman who has died. Such a situation adds a lot to his backstory—think of the Lethal Weapon movies.
After all, how many Heroes on the Masculine journey get the girl in the end? Many!
For all you skeptics out there, take a look at the following two love letters written by Napoleon and King Henry, and you will see that even a great solider, leader, or King can fall in love and reveal something of his character at the same time…
