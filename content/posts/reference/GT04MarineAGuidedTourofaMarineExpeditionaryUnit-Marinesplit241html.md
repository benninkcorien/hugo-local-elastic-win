In 1846 American settlers poured into California, where they soon outgunned the tiny Mexican garrisons. Fremont led these settlers in the "Bear Flag Revolt," which briefly established California as a fictitious independent country. This is why the state flag is still inscribed "California Republic." Later, during the Mexican War, the Navy's Pacific Squadron under Commodore John D. Sloat seized the towns along the California coast, with the help of Fremont's local forces. California officially joined the United States in 1850 as the thirty-first state.

"Blue water" may also be viewed as ocean areas beyond the direct influence of enemy land-based airpower.

This was codified in law so that no future President or Secretary of Defense could disband the Corps or reduce it to a token force merely through an executive order or administrative reorganization. President Harry S Truman was not fond of the Marine Corps. The Congress, during those years, was not fond of President Truman.
