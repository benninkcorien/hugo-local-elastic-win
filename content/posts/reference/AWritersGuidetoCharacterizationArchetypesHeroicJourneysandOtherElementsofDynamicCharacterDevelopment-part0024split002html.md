A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Star Trek: Insurrection
In a scene with Jean-Luc Picard and Anij, one of the planet’s inhabitants, Anij “freezes” time and tells Jean-Luc that he needs to slow down and find the joy in common moments. One of the quirks (benefits) of the natives of the planet is that they live a long, long time and some of them can learn to freeze time in order to longer enjoy a pleasurable moment.
The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver
The heroine’s growing respect of the land and the natural world—shown through her delight in seeing a first summer rain in the desert—reflects her growing understanding of Native American identity.
