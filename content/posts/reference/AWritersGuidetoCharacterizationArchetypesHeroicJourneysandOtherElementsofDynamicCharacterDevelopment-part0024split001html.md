A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE HUMMINGBIRD’S CHARACTER ARC
The hummingbird’s lesson is one of learning how to be present in all moments of life in order to find the joy in it. Modern society does not teach how to do this, and often when people try to do it, all of their problems and stresses flood into their minds. It can be quite painful and anxiety producing. Just take a moment and try to meditate for a few minutes and see what happens.
A lot of characters can struggle with this concept. Busy moms who manage a lot of children are a good example. They sometimes need to lock themselves in the bathroom to get a minute of peace. Learning how to relax and see the life that is happening all around you is a great way to recharge and handle this boundless energy to do everything else that one needs to do throughout the day.
An example might be a serious businessman and his assistant, who has done everything she can to get him to take some time off, but it is not until he gets hurt and needs to recuperate and do nothing, that he finally learns the lesson. After he reevaluates his life and his priorities, he goes for what is really important. This kind of major overhaul can require a lot of stirring up. It could take a couple of days, a couple of weeks, or a couple of months of reorganizing things and being in even more chaos and more craziness as he takes the steps to change life.
The same kind of thing happens when a person realizes it’s best to downsize—to move out of a huge house into a smaller home (or a condo) in order to save money and relinquish all the stress that keeping up with a huge mansion brings about. It’s the kind of decision that produces several months of chaos and increased activity before the goal of the new home is achieved.
Difficulties often are dredged up in the process of making a change. If this lesson is the whole story, as it often is in the Chick-lit genre, the heroine gets some sort of wake-up call to change her life and move forward in a different way.
