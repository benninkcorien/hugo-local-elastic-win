A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
Although these two are opposing archetypes in many ways, they both are very independent and self-sufficient, and they want to make it in a man’s world as his equal. They are also both take-charge kind of gals who need to be in control.
While the Amazon values herself as a woman and doesn’t care what men think about her, the Father’s Daughter cares deeply what men think about her. She works day-to-day with men, trying to get up the corporate ladder. She plays with men and studies with men.
The Amazon can help the Father’s Daughter get in touch with her female power. She can show the Father’s Daughter that a woman can be whole unto herself. She can teach her to honor her cycles, something the Father’s Daughter may want to suppress with pills.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Amazon that everything is not about gender. She can show her that men and women can get along and be great friends, and that there is value in fitting in and getting to the top as a woman.
