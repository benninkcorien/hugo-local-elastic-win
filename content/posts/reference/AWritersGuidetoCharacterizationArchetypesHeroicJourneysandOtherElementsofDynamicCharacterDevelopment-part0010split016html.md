A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE MATRIARCH
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. She loves to be in control and won’t be able to cope if he is so unpredictable.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits to her husband or family. With the Protector, she will spend a lot of time trying to make things perfect for him so he won’t fly off the handle. She will take care of everything. In this way, he may take her for granted but he better not do it for long because he can only push her so far before she stands up for herself. Her marriage is important to her, and she won’t give up easily, but ‘home base,’ in whatever form, is her domain.
He knows she does a lot for him, and he respects her for standing up to him. He takes it very seriously when she fights back because he knows he must have done something wrong to get her so angry.
She respects his space and knows he loves her, but she may do better with a more subservient man. On the other hand, a more powerful husband can set limits on her queendom, thus stopping her from taking over the kids’ lives.
