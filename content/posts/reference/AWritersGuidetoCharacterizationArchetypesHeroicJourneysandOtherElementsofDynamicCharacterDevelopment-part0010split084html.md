A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
SLEEPING BEAUTY: BOTH THE HERO AND HEROINE HOLD THE POWER.
“Love Conquers All” and “Second Chances”
Of the three stories outlined here, Sleeping Beauty walks the middle road, where the hero and heroine are true equals sharing in the same type of fate before they meet each other.
   •  Sleeping Beauty is the victim of a curse.
   •  No one can help her but the good fairy who changes the wicked spell of death put upon her. Beauty sleeps instead of dies and all the royal servants are put to sleep with her.
   •  The Prince, wandering the lands in search of something he can’t name or find, happens upon her castle and enters.
   •  He finds her sleeping and falls in love with her. His whole world changes as he realizes this feeling of true love is what he was seeking all along.
   •  He kisses her and she awakens. She had been dreaming of him and waiting for him for centuries and is so happy he is here. They get married.
Both the hero and heroine are in dire straights. They are both ‘asleep’ before their chance meeting, lost in waiting and longing for something more. The Prince did not know what ailed him until he laid eyes upon her and felt love course through his heart.
They fall in love at the same time, and they both grow from the union. They are very much alike and on equal footing. Very often these stories use plot to keep the couple separated and battling obstacles.
This story focuses on the couple being able to stay together, since they fall in love with each other right away.
