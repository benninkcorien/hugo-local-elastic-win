Improvised and Custom Knives, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Improvised and Custom Knives
Writers have four routes for characters in need of improvised knives: shivs, disguised, ballistic, and custom. No matter the style, keep this in mind: If a character can make a point or edge, he or she can make an improvised knife.
Shivs and Shanks: Knives That Would Make MacGyver Proud (or Not)
Knives put together from pieces of otherwise mundane materials are called shivs or shanks, although they could go by any number of names.
In his memoir, crime writer Les Edgerton, who speaks from personal prison experience, advises not using the term shiv. To his eye, the word makes a writer look phony. He prefers shank.
Shiv may well be passé with some writers, but it still gets the point across. Just pick a term and stick with it. This section will use shiv for the sake of consistency (sorry, Les).
No matter the materials used, the principles for building a shiv are the same:
Create a point or an edge.
Add a handle or design a way to hold the point or edge.
Take a cheap shot at an opponent.
It’s that point that counts. Unlike a traditional knife, shivs don’t necessarily need edges, although those help. This simplicity is what makes shivs so versatile.
How that point or edge is created requires imagination. Here are a few ideas to get the brain percolating, sorted by material.
Ceramics and porcelain: A shard of ceramic material or porcelain can make an ideal shiv. Getting a toilet to break is another story.
Cigarette filters: The cotton inside cigarette filters is actually a synthetic material. Remove it from the paper wrapper and apply a flame. It can be melted and formed into a point. How effective this is may depend on the writer’s tolerance of creative license.
Clothing: Unless a garment is made from 100 percent natural fibers, it probably contains enough synthetic material to melt. Melt the garment into a mold to form it into a point.
Glass: A shard of glass, even a small one, makes for the perfect shiv. Handles could be fashioned from a strip of cloth, a melted piece of plastic, or other materials.
Metal: Softer, flexible metals work best for shivs, such as the kind used in silverware, beer cans, or crappy furniture, such as a folding chair. To make a point, you can file, cut, bend, or melt the metal.
Paper: Roll up some paper, then fold it to create a point. This is surprisingly effective with newsprint but can work with other paper products as well. Every fold and layer of paper will make the point stronger.
Plastic: Melt down the plastic material, then mold it into a point or insert pointed objects into it and use the plastic part as a handle. This is the basis of the classic prison shiv: the melted toothbrush with a razor stuck in it.
Rock, concrete, and brick: Bust off a shard. Voila, you have a point. The rock, concrete, or brick would probably work well on its own as a handle.
Wood: Channel your inner Boy Scout and whittle a point. This can be done without a knife given enough time. Just like metals, harder woods can bludgeon and shape softer woods. Of course, wood is also the perfect handle.
Tools, writing instruments, and other small, pointy things: If it has a point, it can be a shiv.
Chances are good that nonincarcerated writers have shiv-making material within arm’s length at any moment. That’s actually a pretty disturbing thought, but it’s true. If it can be melted, molded, cut, folded, shaved, filed, smashed, ripped, or elbow-dropped into a point, it can be made into a shiv.
Because of their hobo aesthetics, remember that shivs lack durability and ergonomics (i.e., they’re not easy to hold firmly). They’re for scenes involving surprise attacks. In all likelihood, they’ll fall apart after the first use. Characters might use them to damage the most vulnerable areas, such as the eyes or face, for this reason.
The Cardsharp is about the size of a credit card and folds into a knife. It can’t pay for dinner, but it can cut the steak. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Disguised Knives: Probably Illegal, Definitely Dramatic
Knives disguised as mundane objects come in handy in fiction. If it matters to the plot, check local and state laws about the legality of these items, since they are usually restricted.
Here’s a list of the most common disguised knives available commercially:
ammunition shells (just don’t load them into a gun)
belts
canes
coins
combs and brushes
credit cards (the cards fold into a knife; check out the Cardsharp for an example)
lipstick
pendants on necklaces
pens
rings
umbrellas
The law limits the field of commercial products, but characters with time and ingenuity could come up with other ways to disguise knives.
These items bring a definite cool factor to a story. For practical purposes, that’s about as far as they go outside of slicing an apple. Yes, they can be used for combat. But like shivs, they lack ergonomics. They’ll probably wind up on the ground during a struggle.
Unlike shivs, the surprise of disguised knives isn’t in the attack—it’s the fact they even appeared at all. Characters might use disguised knives for intimidation rather than for fighting. It’s up to the writer.
Ballistic Knives: Just One Trip to the Hardware Store Away
A ballistic knife is usually homemade from parts available at most hardware stores. There are many styles, but typical construction involves a cylinder, a spring, a knife or other edged projectile, and some sort of release. The spring is compressed and released to launch the projectile. These knives are often restricted, so research state and local laws against the setting if it will matter to the story.
Characters could throw a ballistic knife together with the right tools and some time. Ballistic knives are best for a surprise attack, when throwing a knife is either not possible or beyond a character’s abilities.
It’s my opinion that ballistic knives make a bad substitute for the real thing—a firearm or a regular knife—unless circumstances are dire. The spring must be reset with each shot, which means reloading is a chore. There’s not much to speak of for accuracy, so unless the target character is a few feet away, it will probably miss the mark,. That means the target character could pick up the knife and retaliate.
Custom Knives: Turning Trash into Talons
One of the most popular custom knife-making books on the market is Wayne Goddard’s $50 Knife Shop. In it, Goddard describes how to use $50 worth of common tools to make a knife. Metal is heated, shaped, cooled, and sharpened, or just cut into a knife. It’s not as easy as one, two, three, but it’s doable. The result is a fixed blade knife ready for hard use (or opening mail, depending on the results).
It’s not like Goddard holds some secret to that process. Humans have been making knives for eons. Lost in the modern world is how relatively easy—and cheap—it can be to do so. A character with mechanical know-how and the right tools could make a rudimentary knife in a day or so.
