A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE MATRIARCH
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings, and this will happen easily with the Matriarch in his life, if he stays around long enough. She loves to be in control and won’t stand for him doing anything and everything he wants.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits to her husband or family. With the Fool she will probably overcompensate by watching his every move and keeping track of his every free minute. But she will also take care of everything at home, so he doesn’t have to learn those responsibilities. This is what may drive him to stay with her.
He doesn’t understand someone who is so driven to take part in the lives of others as she does. Such diligence takes too much time and effort, and in the meantime, your own life gets dull. Live and let live he says.
She doesn’t respect him when he gets adventurous. She sees him as crazy for taking the risks that he takes. She will never join in with his risky undertakings unless an emotional incident pushes her over the edge. She shapes the lives of her family. They can’t get on without her. Her worth comes from her family, and his worth comes from completing the tasks and risks he sets out to accomplish. He can be one of the biggest braggers.
