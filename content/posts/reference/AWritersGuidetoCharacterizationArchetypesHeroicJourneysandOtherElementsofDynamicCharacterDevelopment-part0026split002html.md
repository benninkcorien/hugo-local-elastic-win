A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
The Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien
Frodo does not ask for the ring or the responsibility he must bear, but it is thrust upon him and he must endure his task for the whole world is at stake. Other characters try to help him but ultimately he must go it alone leaving his entire life behind.
The Fly
A brilliant but eccentric scientist begins to transform into a giant man/fly hybrid after one of his experiments goes horribly wrong.
Halloween
A psychotic murderer escapes his institution and stalks a bookish teenage girl and her friends while his doctor chases him through the streets. The girl goes through a harsh transformation as she learns about the darker side of life, fear, and survival. In the end, she is a completely changed person—in some ways for good and in some ways for bad.
