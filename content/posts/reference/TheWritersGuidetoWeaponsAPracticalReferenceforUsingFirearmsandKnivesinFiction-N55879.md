Top Weapons Myths, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Top Weapons Myths
In this section you’ll find common myths and misconceptions found in thrillers, mysteries, and crime fiction. These tropes are easy to trip over, so avoiding them will really juice that writer cred.
1. Clip and magazine mean the same thing.
They don’t. And when most writers use clip, they really mean magazine. Colloquially that may not make a big difference with readers, but, technically speaking, they’re not synonymous. Confusing the two is also a major indication that the writer isn’t familiar with firearms. In the vast majority of cases, magazine or mag is accurate.
A magazine holds cartridges in reserve inside the firearm, where they wait to be loaded for firing. Some magazines are built into the firearms themselves. Others are detachable.
A clip holds cartridges together for insertion into a magazine. Taking the extra step to put the cartridges into the clip can be necessary depending on the firearm’s design. However, most firearms don’t require a clip outside of a few older models.
Let’s say you select a firearm for a story and you can see that it uses a detachable container housing ammunition but aren’t sure if magazine or clip is the right term. Here’s an easy rule of thumb for telling the difference: If most of the cartridges are exposed, it’s a clip. If most of the cartridges are concealed, it’s a magazine.
Again, magazine or mag are the safe bets in almost all instances. And remember, revolvers don’t load with clips or magazines (moon clips are an exception, explained in the section on handgun ammunition).
If this seems like splitting hairs, it’s not. This is a major gripe from the gun crowd—and therefore with many of your potential readers. It’s also an easy fix with a tremendous return on investment.
2. Bullet is the same as shell, round, or cartridge.
This is another set of terms sometimes used interchangeably. Like clip and magazine, they are not the same things.
A bullet is a component of a cartridge (aka a shell or round). It’s the metal projectile seated at the top of the cartridge.
These are empty casings, not empty bullets. Bullets are what fly through the air. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
The cartridge (shell or round) is the whole thing, which includes the bullet, powder, primer, casing, and other components. When Maynard investigates a crime scene, he spots empty casings on the ground, not empty bullets.
3. Pumping a shotgun heightens the dramatic effect.
False. This usually happens when one character intimidates another with a shotgun during a tense situation. It actually makes no sense. Having a character pump a shotgun to punctuate the drama has less to do with looking tough and more to do with being stupid.
A pump-action shotgun loads a shell with a single pump. That same pump simultaneously ejects the previously loaded shell, whether it’s been fired or not. An extra pump for dramatic effect after the shotgun is loaded is just dumping unfired ammunition onto the ground.
A dramatic shotgun pump is called for only if the firearm is not loaded. However, why stick a character into a tense situation with an unloaded shotgun in the first place?
Instead of Maynard pumping the shotgun to show he means business, he might drop a corny catchphrase instead.
“I’d ask him if he brought oyster crackers, because his face is about to be soup. And then when he asks what oyster crackers are, I’d shoot him in the gal-damn face,” Maynard says.
Maynard’s quip still isn’t as groan inducing as the shotgun pump trope.
4. The same goes for cocking the hammer on a handgun for dramatic effect.
This trope is usually used when one character intimidates another with a handgun. It’s unnecessary for the same reason as dramatic shotgun pumping. Why aim a gun at someone if it’s not ready to fire?
Let’s start with the basics. There are two kinds of handguns: revolvers and pistols. A revolver has a rotating cylinder of multiple chambers where cartridges are inserted (think Dirty Harry’s .44 Magnum or a cowboy’s trusty Colt). Pistols use only a single, stationary chamber where cartridges are fed in and out (think James Bond’s iconic Walther or a police officer’s Glock).
These revolvers and pistols can be further broken down into single-actions and double-actions. Each type addresses the hammer—the metal tab that must be pulled back (cocked) in order to ready the firearm to shoot.
With a single-action revolver, the shooter must manually cock the hammer before each shot. It’s a little different with a double-action revolver. The shooter can either cock the hammer or not before pulling the trigger to shoot.
Pistols are another story. Most modern single-action pistols have hammers that must be cocked before firing. However, the hammer is cocked automatically as the firearm is loaded or fired.
With double-action pistols, cocking the hammer is not necessary prior to pulling the trigger.
Now let’s see if dramatic hammer cocking makes sense with each type.
Single-action revolvers: This type of handgun makes the best case, but dramatic cocking is still unnecessary. A single-action revolver’s hammer must be cocked before firing. If the point is intimidation, however, don’t wait to get the gun ready. Have the character cock it before meeting the opposition.
Double-action revolvers: A shooter can simply pull the trigger to make this type of handgun fire, so consider additional cocking excessive. A revolver ready to fire is intimidating on its own. Don’t add a needless step in the process.
Single-action pistols: Most modern single-action pistols cock automatically as the first round is loaded (explained in the section on handguns). So I’ll pose the same question I posed for single-action revolvers: Why on earth would a character entering a taut situation wield a pistol and not be ready to fire? No need for dramatic cocking.
Double-action pistols: This is an easy one. The character doesn’t need to cock anything. Just pull the trigger and shoot. Dramatic cocking is totally unnecessary.
Writers experienced with firearms will think of exceptions to these rules, and they’re free to do so. However, here’s my rule of thumb: Ditch all dramatic cocking.
There are good reasons for eliminating dramatic cocking that go beyond the technical. A character pausing to unnecessarily cock the hammer is shifting attention away from the surroundings. That split second might be the perfect opportunity for someone else to attack. Also, a writer might lose count of the number of times a handgun is cocked. I’ve read more than a few stories where a single handgun was cocked multiple times without ever firing. The character kept cocking that hammer over and over.
If all of this went over your head, there’s an easy fix: Don’t write about characters cocking handguns as a way to accent the drama or highlight a point.
5. Most rifles and all shotguns reload with a pump.
For some reason in fiction, it’s somewhat common for characters to pump any shotgun (and sometimes rifle) within reach. After all, the click-clack sound of a shooter pumping a sliding mechanism underneath the barrel is iconic. That’s fine if the firearm uses a pump to load and reload ammunition. But not all do.
As a reader, I’ve come across many examples of this misnomer. Bolt-action rifle? Pumped for dramatic effect. Sawed-off, single-shot shotgun? Reloaded with a pump. Fully automatic tactical rifle? Pumped. Handguns? Okay, I haven’t seen those pumped. Yet.
Know how your weapon works before pumping away at a terrible mistake.
6. It’s okay to look down the barrel to see if it’s loaded.
Nope. Unless a character has a death wish, there is never a reason to look down the barrel of a firearm. If Maynard needs to see if his firearm is loaded, he can crack open the action for a peek at the chamber (the spot inside the firearm where ammunition is seated just before firing).
“Of course, pulling the trigger works, too,” Maynard says. “You’ll know in a real hurry if the gun is loaded.”
7. The term assault weapon is a handy catchall term for any rifle with military-style features.
Actually, assault weapon is what irregardless is to the editorial world. It gets a certain point across, but it’s better substituted by another more accurate word.
Federal, state, and local regulations usually use the term assault weapon when labeling a category of restricted firearms. None of these regulations are consistent. What was considered an assault weapon in the 1930s is different from the definition in the 1990s. It’s also not a term the firearms industry often uses to describe its products.
The solution is to use a term other than assault weapon. Tactical rifle, tactical shotgun, machine gun, submachine gun, fully automatic rifle, and even the ubergeneric gun all work better than the vague assault weapon. (You can find these terms in the glossary at the end of this book.) They are blanket terms that cover firearms with features suitable for combat or defense. The firearm industry uses these terms, too.
And now for the caveat.
There’s yet another way around the term assault weapon—using assault rifle. The term receives a special mention because of how closely it mirrors the image that, I think, many writers have when using assault weapon.
Assault rifle is defined, as Patrick Sweeney writes in The Gun Digest Book of the AK & SKS, as “a shoulder-fired, select-fire weapon used by an individual soldier, firing a cartridge of intermediate rifle caliber, with a detachable high-capacity magazine.” Select-fire, by the way, means it can switch between semi- and full-auto modes.
If a writer is looking for something along those lines, assault rifle may be an appropriate upgrade over assault weapon.
8. Semi-automatic and fully automatic are pretty much the same thing.
False. A semi-automatic firearm will shoot one time with each pull of the trigger. This is a key difference compared to fully automatic firearms, which can fire multiple times with a single pull of the trigger.
Confusing one for the other is a major trip-up area when writing, especially when citing “automatic” firearms without deciding on the type. Pick one and stick to it.
9. Fully automatic firearms are just as accurate as any other weapon.
In truth, they lose accuracy in a hurry. Sorry, wannabe Rambos, but holding down the trigger on a fully automatic firearm kills accuracy, not bad guys.
Fully automatic firearms are most accurate when fired in short bursts. This keeps the shots grouped together rather than air balling all over the place.
The reason for this has everything to do with recoil—the manner in which a gun jerks back when firing a round. The impact of recoil becomes exponentially greater the longer the trigger is pulled because there’s no recovery time between shots. The shooter is budged off target little by little with each shot. That can translate into big, Shaq-at-the-free-throw-line misses.
Guns mounted to vehicles or structures are a different story, since they transfer that recoil energy into solid materials.
10. Fully automatic firearms will fire continuously for minutes on end.
Again, wannabe Rambos need to check their egos at the door. Hold down that trigger and don’t blink as the thirty-, fifty-, or one hundred-round magazine empties in a matter of seconds, not minutes. That’s approximately 1.3 Rambo grunts per magazine—not nearly enough time to cover for Sylvester Stallone’s acting abilities.
A character needs to reload every few seconds to keep a continuous stream of lead in the air. Figure that into a scene with a lot of full-auto gunplay. While you’re at it, determine how the character is lugging around all that ammunition.
“This is exactly why I fire my fully automatic rifle in short bursts whenever my creditors come to repossess the RV,” Maynard says.
Right on, Maynard. That method is more accurate and conserves ammunition.
11. It’s easy to make a vehicle’s gas tank explode by shooting it.
It’s actually pretty difficult. Here are three reasons why.
First, gas tanks are often surrounded by metal and other durable parts. Just take a look underneath any car. Metal can be difficult to puncture with a projectile from a distance, even when that projectile comes out of a firearm.
Second, just because a projectile enters a container of gasoline at high speed doesn’t mean an explosion is imminent. Liquid gasoline isn’t flammable. Its fumes are what combust. Gas tanks are designed with that in mind, because no one wants the tank to catch fire.
Last, a spark needs to meet those fumes in the presence of oxygen. Gas tanks contain some air, but they’re closed off from the outside environment. A big explosion requires a lot of oxygen, which won’t be found inside the tank.
“Now wait a minute,” Maynard says. “I rolled my RV a few cases back trying to get away from some gun-totin’ hippies. They got out and opened fire. The next thing I know, the gal-damn RV is burning hot like a toupee in a toaster. You telling me the sun was in my eyes?”
You weren’t seeing things, Maynard. Those hippies executed the best-case scenario for lighting up a vehicle with gunfire. They punctured the gas tank, let the fuel drain out, and fired again to produce a spark off the vehicle or pavement to ignite the fumes.
This trick is the best choice for writers. However, keep in mind the resulting blaze will be more in line with dumping gas on a campfire than it will be an ear-shattering explosion of the sort you see in the movies.
In 2012, I interviewed the organizer of Boomershoot for Gun Digest. This for-fun event offers shooters the chance to hit explosive targets. Not kiddie Fourth of July explosives. Huge, might-want-to-take-another-step-back explosives.
The organizer told me the target must be hit solidly in order for the explosives to catch, though powerful firearms (from a safe distance) are used. Not every hit yields an explosion, he said, even those that are right on target.
Unlike vehicles, these explosives are not shielded in metal, they don’t require fumes and a spark to ignite, and they are designed to explode when shot by a firearm. Still, they don’t light up easily.
While that may make it more challenging to write certain scenes, it should be reassuring the next time you drive a car.
12. A firearm’s rate of fire equals how many shots it can make in one minute.
What does it mean when the specs on a semi-automatic or fully automatic firearm state its rate of fire is, for example, 1,000 rounds per minute? That means a person could fire one thousand rounds with the gun in one minute, right?
Nope. Rate of fire is a mechanical measurement that gauges how quickly consecutive shots can exit the firearm. It’s the equivalent of miles per hour in a car, except for guns.
In reality, a firearm shooting for a solid minute is probably going to fail, due to either overheating or a jam, so hitting that rate of fire isn’t likely.
Also, a weapon with a high rate of fire isn’t necessarily better than one with a low rate. It just means it doesn’t need as much time—usually fractions of a second—between consecutive shots.
13. Bigger knives are always badder.
Nope, not always. Big knives, such as machetes, play a prominent role in horror, war, adventure, thriller, and crime fiction. In the real world, they are heavy, bulky, difficult to conceal, and harder to control than smaller knives.
Smaller knives are, as a rule of thumb, easier for characters to use for fighting, transporting, concealing, and opening their mail.
“I don’t know what you mean. I always greet the mailman with my machete,” Maynard says.
There are surely exceptions to this rule. But in my experience, smaller knives are usually more practical for the rigors of reality. For instance, the experts in professional knife-fighting demonstrations at BLADE events use small knives, not large ones.
14. Blood grooves (also called fullers) on a knife are named after the bodily fluid.
The fuller, or blood groove, on this blade looks like a long trench carved out of the metal. The term blood groove has more to do with balance and aesthetics than blood and guts. (Photo courtesy of SharpByCoop for BLADE.)
Despite what their name implies, these long indentations along a knife’s blade aren’t actually used for channeling blood from a wound. They don’t make it easier to remove the blade from a body, either. Rather they reduce the weight of the blade. That’s about it. Knife designers use blood grooves to achieve a certain balance or feel. Blood grooves are actually pretty boring.
15. Dull knives are safer knives.
Actually, the Boy Scouts had it right: Sharp equals safe; dull equals dangerous. Dull knives are not safer than sharp knives. The sharper the cutting edge, the more efficiently it distributes force into what is being cut. A dull blade will actually look roundish when viewed under a microscope. The roundness doesn’t offer much friction to grip with, so it moves force away from the cutting edge, causing the knife to slip.
“I look roundish when not viewed under a microscope. So I know all about dull knives,” Maynard says. “Here’s a tip. Everyone makes a big deal about sharpening knives before torturing someone. I say use a knife as dull as an orange slice in the sun. That’ll knock some socks off.”
16. A gun is always more dangerous than a knife.
Surprisingly, this is false in some situations. Knives are as lethal as firearms at distances of 21 feet or less. There’s an old saying about never bringing a knife to a gun fight, but when a knife-wielding bad guy confronts Maynard 21 feet away, the gal-damn detective’s revolver is not guaranteed a win.
Sgt. Dennis Tueller created the Tueller Drill in 1983 to develop handgun skills during a knife attack. It was determined that an attacker could be shot and killed with a holstered handgun at a range of only 21 feet or more. At closer than 21 feet, the knife attacker could reach the gunman before he was able to draw and shoot.
This 21-foot rule has garnered its share of controversy, given the infinite variables of defensive situations. But it’s still a good rule of thumb for writing fiction. Maynard has about 1.5 seconds (per the Tueller Drill) to draw his handgun from the holster and shoot the knife-wielding bad guy who is 21 feet away.
Even then, you must consider that mortally wounded people don’t die right away. So there’s still time beyond that 1.5 seconds for the bad guy to plant a blade in Maynard’s chest.
17. Switchblades are the most deadly kind of knives.
In truth, they aren’t any deadlier than other knives. The reason switchblades are illegal has less to do with their lethal ability and more to do with the politics of the mid-twentieth century. That’s covered earlier in this guide.
There’s not much a less restricted type of knife can’t do just as well, or better, than a switchblade. For example, newer, legal knives called assisted openers appear to function identically to a switchblade. However, because of their mechanical design, assisted openers are far less restricted. Also, the lethality of any knife depends on how it’s used, not necessarily its design.
18. Suppressors (a.k.a. silencers) render a gun completely silent.
Writing a silencer into a scene can be a necessary plot device. For obvious reasons, Maynard requires stealth when he takes out the sleeping mob boss.
But so-called silencers aren’t nearly as effective at muting firearms as fictional accounts would have you believe. They take some of the sting out of the resulting shot, but they don’t render the controlled explosion of gunpowder silent. And they certainly don’t all make the muted joot sound from the movies. (See the Suppressors, Silencers, Scopes, and Sights section in this book.)
19. Sawed-off shotguns are far more powerful than their full-barrel counterparts.
Ammunition determines firepower, not barrel length. Nothing about sawing off the barrel of any firearm makes it more powerful. The advantages of sawed-offs are detailed in the Shotguns 101 section of this guide.
20. The “smell of cordite” is in the air.
Writers depicting the “smell of cordite” in the air after gunfire are forgetting the stuff isn’t used in modern gunpowder. It’s been obsolete for several decades.
Here’s the rule of thumb: If a story is set from the late 1800s to just before World War II, go ahead and reference cordite. After World War II, call it gunpowder or propellant and leave it at that.
21. Tilting a handgun to the side to look cool is an effective way to shoot.
Just say no to tilted handguns. The cool factor wears off when the shooting starts. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Actually, it’s a great way to hit nothing. Any character familiar with handguns would not attempt to shoot in this way.
Maynard likes to look badass at bingo halls. He tilts his handgun to the side, gangsta style, when demanding a review of the numbers called. He’ll look plenty mean until the shooting starts.
With their short barrels, handguns are difficult to shoot accurately in the first place. Tilting a gun reduces accuracy even further.
Shots fired this way tend to pull horizontally to the left or right. This is because recoil moves force along the bend of the shooter’s wrist. That’s not helpful when Maynard aims at a vertically oriented bingo number caller.
Bottom line: Tilting is for looks or intimidation only. Correct it when the shooting starts.
Of course, the same applies to tilted shotguns and rifles.
22. Being shot by a gun is like getting hit by a train loaded with concrete and circus animals.
Physics says otherwise. For example, a bad guy shoots Maynard with a shotgun at close range near a window. The force from the shot blows Maynard through the window, sending him down ten stories to his death.
But Maynard’s actually okay, because physics wouldn’t allow for that to happen.
“Actually, I’m bleeding pretty bad,” Maynard says.
Yes, Maynard would still be shot, but the blast wouldn’t send him through the window to fall to his death. Replace the shotgun with another type of firearm, or the window with another structure, and the song remains the same.
Consider Newton’s third law of motion: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If the gunshot carried enough force to throw Maynard through a window, an equal amount of force would be exerted on the shooter. The shooter should be blown backward just as Maynard was thrown forward.
That just doesn’t happen with firearms. It’s a good thing, too, for shooters and windows everywhere.
Even if he’s shot at from a close distance, Maynard isn’t going far. He’ll take the shot, stagger, and probably fall to the floor. The projectile(s) will either lodge inside his body or pass through him. Keep in mind that humans are mostly water. Shoot a bag of water and it doesn’t fly across the room, but it may explode, rip open, or leak.
“That’s what I’m doing right now,” Maynard says. “Please get a towel; I’m dying over here.”
23. Real-world gunfights can drag on and on.
In truth, they are usually over in a few seconds. The 3-3-3 Rule is commonly cited in the defensive firearms arena. It goes like this: Most gunfights in the real world last for three seconds, involve three rounds of ammunition, and take place at a distance of 3 yards.
Sounds kind of boring, huh? That’s why the world needs fiction writers.
Although the 3-3-3 Rule isn’t set in stone, it’s a great formula for writing. Figure in one shot per gun-wielding character per second. The most famous gunfight in U.S. history, the Gunfight at the OK Corral, likely took place in thirty seconds and involved an equal number of shots fired.
How you write gunfights is up to you. If you’re shooting for accuracy, keep the 3-3-3 Rule in mind. If your aim is to entertain readers with something longer and filled with gunfire, at least you have an understanding of this concept.
24. Handguns go click-click-click when they’re empty.
A typical trope in fiction is for a character—usually an antagonist—to become surprised by an empty handgun at an inconvenient moment. The character pulls the trigger repeatedly, but the firearm just goes click-click-click.
For semi-automatic pistols, that’s just not mechanically possible. A single click might be audible depending on the model, but certainly not multiple clicks with each pull of the trigger. This is because the pistol must actually be shot to reset the firing pin, which is the source of the click.
With revolvers, it’s obvious after the first click that the handgun is out of ammunition, so pulling the trigger again isn’t warranted. Same goes with rifles and shotguns.
Rule of thumb: Keep the clicks to one at most.
25. Characters should shoot the locks out of doors to gain entry.
Doing so is dangerous and a bad idea. After encountering a locked door, Maynard might be able to gain entry by shooting the lock out. Much depends on whether the part of the lock destroyed is also the part latching the door. More powerful firearms are more likely to be successful. Even then there’s no guarantee something as simple as a standard padlock will break apart.
But the real issue is the risk of injury. Shooting a lock a few feet away (or any object up close) could create a spray of deadly shrapnel. Ouch. Better find the key instead.
Half-Myths to Keep in Mind
In the process of creating this list, several myths came up that fell into a gray area. Here’s a quick rundown.
It is possible for a loaded firearm to fire when dropped, but it’s not likely. It’d be even more unusual (read: highly unlikely) for the dropped firearm to shoot more than once.
Bullets can create sparks when ricocheting off metal, but the visual effect is not nearly as dramatic as what’s depicted in fiction. Sparks would be brief and tiny. They wouldn’t light up a room as the bullet bounces here and there.
It’s possible for people to die immediately from a single gunshot wound, such as one to the head, but it’s not always the case. The old cowboy movies liked to depict people getting shot once and immediately dying, as if bullets were the Grim Reaper’s sickle. Death can come that quickly, but remember that it’s also possible for mortally wounded people to survive for a short time. Deer hunters have told stories of game being shot through the heart and running dozens of yards. Humans aren’t so different.
A successful shot through a glass window is possible, but it’s challenging to accomplish with any accuracy. Consider that glass, along with any obstruction, will affect (or stop) a bullet’s trajectory. The thicker the glass, the more energy it will absorb from the bullet and the more likely it is to stop the projectile. Bullet-resistant glass is built in layers designed to flex and absorb more energy than nonresistant glass, but it can still fail. In either case, creative license allows you to choose if a shot successfully breaks through the glass. In reality, there are no guarantees one way or the other.
Chances are better than not that Maynard will be okay if he jumps in a lake as bad guys shoot at him. A bullet entering water will be slowed down and could change trajectory. It’s no guarantee of survival, though. Maynard still has to come up to breathe.
Shooting a tire on a moving vehicle is difficult but not impossible. Maynard should aim for the sidewall, not the tread, for the best chance of penetrating the tire. The sidewall isn’t as tough as the tread, and more of it is exposed. That means Maynard needs to drive his RV so it’s parallel to the bad guy’s car before trying to shoot out the tires.
Firing shots at a car speeding away is more likely to cause collateral damage than anything else. Sure, a lucky shot could take out a tire or window. What about the shots that don’t hit the vehicle? Would they connect with an innocent bystander instead? And would a wounded or dead driver actually be more of a hazard?
Misfires can happen, but fiction—as a matter of convenience—exaggerates their frequency and their timing.
One Final Point: It’s Not the Size of the Boat but the Motion of the Ocean
Big firearms and the power they pack get all the attention in thrillers and crime fiction. Their lethality seems to be proportional to their size.
However, there are many more factors at play than just size. Shot placement is a big one. If Maynard pops a bad guy in the heart with a light rifle, he has a good chance of making a kill. Likewise a poorly placed shot with a larger rifle may leave “just a flesh wound.”
Distance, angle, properties of the projectile, environmental conditions, shooter ability, and interfering materials are as important as firepower.
Bottom line: Any firearm can be lethal, but not every firearm is always lethal. Don’t outfit characters with a “big gun” to suggest lethality. Make the characters skilled shooters instead.
