The Hit List, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
The Hit List
What follows is a go-to catalog of firearms and knives to use for writing. The aim is to make it easy for you to find a firearm or knife to use for a character or scene.
Top Firearms and Knives of Film and Fiction
.38 Special Revolvers/Snubnoses
The Colt Detective Special embodies the classic “snubnose” revolver. Consider a character’s hand size before assigning a snubbie or any handgun. As a rule of thumb, the size of the hands should roughly match the size of the gun. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Capacity: five or six
various makes and models
It’s hard to pin down exactly when the .38 Special revolver became forever linked to the hard-boiled PIs and dark-alley detectives of fiction. It may have started with Elliot Ness, the famous lawman of Prohibition, who carried a .38. Midcentury crime fiction, influenced by the gangster era of Prohibition, may have transplanted Ness’ sidearm into its stories, placing the .38 in the hands of hard-drinking detectives as a sort of ironic twist. That’s my theory anyway.
What isn’t a theory is how often the .38 Special shows up in fiction. Although any revolver with a short barrel could be considered a “snubnose,” the .38 is the most iconic. It’s appropriate to write this revolver as a “.38” or “.38 Special,” as both refer to roughly the same thing (caliber/ammunition).
Several companies make snubnose revolvers. Perhaps the most iconic is the aptly named Colt Detective Special. Introduced in 1926, it has a 2-inch barrel, holds six rounds, and is a double-action so the trigger can be pulled without the hammer being cocked first. It’s still around today and available on the civilian market, where a private eye could pick one up.
While they are iconic, these guns are not without weaknesses. Remember that the shorter the barrel, the worse the accuracy. That snubnose barrel doesn’t have much time to spin the bullet and straighten its trajectory. The most experienced characters could probably maintain accuracy out to 25 yards, but that’s it.
Still, .38 Special ammunition is relatively easy to shoot, given its lower recoil compared to other calibers. Characters inexperienced with firearms could go with a .38 without breaking their wrists or worse.
Colt Model 1911
Not sure which pistol to assign a character? Write in a Model 1911 and call it a day. Chances are excellent the setting and circumstance will fit. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: .45; the most traditional, but other calibers exist
Capacity: varying; as low as six and as high as thirteen
Year introduced: 1911
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before first shot)
slide-action
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the handgun of film, fiction, war, law enforcement, and beyond. Originally manufactured by Colt in 1911, the Model 1911 is a platform that has deviated little from John Browning’s original designs. Since then, nearly every firearms manufacturer has developed a take on the 1911.
Writers who are stuck about what kind of pistol to assign a character should go with the Model 1911. The classic Colt Model 1911 carries seven rounds of .45 caliber ammunition, although capacities and calibers vary.
Keep in mind that the 1911 is a single-action pistol (hammer must be cocked between each shot), but there’s a twist. A character does not need to manually cock the hammer between each shot. The character would insert the magazine, then rack the slide (pulling back and releasing the sliding top of the gun) to chamber the first round. Racking the slide pushes the hammer back in the process. When the pistol is fired, the hammer moves forward and stays there for a brief moment until the force of the shot propels the slide backward, simultaneously cocking the hammer and chambering the next round.
All 1911s use safety mechanisms (multiple mechanisms, in fact) that must be thumbed off before firing. For writing, don’t worry about which safety is switched off where. Just have the character “thumb the safety off” and leave it at that.
With that in mind, the 1911 is the perfect go-to choice for writing fiction.
Israeli Military Industries Desert Eagle
The Desert Eagle comes in many varieties, but the monster .50 caliber is most often used in fiction. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Calibers: .357, .41, .44, .50 (most iconic)
Capacities: nine (.357), eight (.41 and .44), seven (.50)
Year introduced: 1982
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before first shot)
slide-action
The Desert Eagle is the quintessential “hand cannon” in popular culture, permeating everything from books to movies to video games. Many variations exist, but it’s the .50 caliber beast that’s most often used.
This isn’t a handgun for every character (or person). To say it packs a lot of recoil for a handgun is an understatement. Even experienced shooters in great physical shape can become injured operating the Desert Eagle.
This level of overkill may be appealing, or even necessary, to some writers’ scenes. That’s fine. Just don’t assign it to a character who’s not able to handle it.
Skilled characters able to plant a .50 caliber bullet into a target will find the imprint it leaves is absolutely devastating. There’s no shrugging off a hit.
Although it’s a single-action, the Desert Eagle does not require its hammer to be cocked before each shot. As with the 1911, the hammer is cocked as the slide cycles ammunition. The character would “rack the slide” to chamber the first round, then fire away.
Israeli Military Industries Uzi
Fiction often puts Uzis in the hands of antagonists. Why? They’re flashy, they pump out a lot of lead, and they look good paired with slicked-back hair and a moustache. But that’s just one theory. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic submachine gun
Calibers: 9mm (most popular), .41, .45
Capacity: twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-two, fifty (9mm only)
Year introduced: 1950
uses a detachable magazine, not a clip
The term Uzi is sometimes written as a catchall for any modern-looking submachine gun, but it actually refers to a particular firearm. It’s appropriate to write Uzi or UZI, although the first probably looks better in print.
Although the firearm’s heyday was in decades past, it continues to be used by law enforcement and military organizations around the world. The Uzi’s popularity means many variants exist, but go with the specs outlined here as a starting point.
The advantage of the Uzi is its fully automatic operation (multiple shots fire as long as the trigger is pulled) on a compact platform. It’s generally considered more accurate than other similar models, although it’s said to lack ergonomics. Characters would find the Uzi is best suited for close ranges and short bursts.
The bottom line: From 1950 onward, assigning any character in need of a compact submachine gun with an Uzi is a good call.
Smith & Wesson Model 29—The “Dirty Harry” Revolver
The Model 29 comes in several barrel lengths, which should give writers some leeway. This iconic .44 magnum revolver isn’t the most powerful handgun in the world anymore, as Dirty Harry once claimed, but it can still make someone’s day, punk. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Caliber: .44 magnum
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1956
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
“I know what you’re thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you’ve got to ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do you, punk?”
With those lines, Clint Eastwood as “Dirty Harry” Callahan made the Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 magnum revolver famous around the world. Ever since the 1971 Dirty Harry movie, fiction across the board has included the .44 magnum. After all, as Harry says, it’s “the most powerful handgun in the world.” Or is it?
Actually, this time a movie got it right—in 1971. In this case, it was Hollywood that was feeling lucky. The .44 magnum maintained that title for a handful of years, until other factory ammunition caught up and surpassed it in the early 1980s.
Writers can have at it with the .44 mag for their stories. Call it by its proper name, the Smith & Wesson Model 29, for an added ring of authenticity. Just be sure the character using it can handle all that firepower. This isn’t a firearm for first timers or those with weak arm strength.
Tommy Gun
A Thompson Model 1921, better known as the Tommy gun. (Photo courtesy of Paul Goodwin for Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic submachine gun
Caliber: .45
Capacity: twenty, thirty, fifty, one hundred
Year introduced: 1921
uses detachable magazines or ammunition drums
The iconic Tommy gun is the emblem of crime fiction. Does this need a lot of explaining? Didn’t think so.
What writers need to know is that U.S. Brigadier General John Thompson pioneered the firearm during World War I. It took until 1921, however, for Auto-Ordnance to blow up the gun market with its production of the Model 1921 (gun names were so much simpler back then).
The Model 1921 grabbed the attention of police and military forces around the world. They wanted some tweaks for their purposes, and the Model 1923 was the result. However, that version didn’t work out for some mechanical reasons.
The Model 1928, introduced in—incredibly enough—1928, got it right. That version and the Model 1921 both gained infamy during the Great Depression and Prohibition. They became so attached to rum-running gangsters that it prompted the passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the first significant federal regulation of fully automatic firearms.
Once World War II hit, the U.S. military formally adopted the Tommy gun in 1942, dubbing it the M1 Thompson. (Call it the M1 Thompson when used by U.S. forces in your writing). The war kicked off a ton of innovation that eventually rendered the Tommy obsolete in many respects. It gradually phased out of service after 1945. U.S. characters in the 1950s and 1960s might still use them, although their popularity was finished by the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s. International characters might continue to use them beyond the 1970s out of necessity.
For writers, just know that 1921 through the end of World War II in 1945 were prime years for the Tommy gun. Assign this classic to police, military, and criminal characters. Keep in mind, though, that the National Firearms Act restricted civilian purchases of Tommy guns. Average Joe characters would be able to order a Tommy gun out of a Sears catalog between 1921 and 1934, but after that they’d need federal and local permission to own one. See the section on firearm laws for more background on that.
Today new Tommy guns are semi-automatic reproductions for civilian markets. The fully automatics are collectibles and still subject to many restrictions.
Walther Model PPK
James Bond eventually switched to the Walther PPK in Ian Fleming’s novels, but the Nazis used it first. Does that make it a bad handgun? Only if it’s used by a Nazi. Walther handguns are marvels of firearm engineering, used by respectable organizations around the world. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: .32
Capacity: seven
Year introduced: 1929
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
uses a detachable magazine
Author (and former special operative) Ian Fleming kicked off his James Bond novels by assigning the protagonist with a Beretta 418, a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol small enough to conceal just about anywhere. Although Bond used many others, a British firearms expert pressed Fleming to upgrade 007’s primary 418, feeling it wasn’t powerful enough.
Fleming eventually came around to the replacement that would become synonymous with suave protagonists like Bond: the sleek .32 caliber Walther PPK.
Ironically the PPK already had a reputation with the Nazis. However, in World War II .32 ammunition (and its ammo twin in the metric system, the 7.65mm) proliferated around the world. That made perfect sense for a globe-trotting man of mystery like James Bond.
The Walther PPK is a mainstay of fiction and will likely remain so. That’s great for writers, since the PPK wouldn’t be out of place in the hands of characters around the world from 1929 through today. Note that the handgun also comes in .22, .25, and .380 caliber versions, although the .32 is most iconic.
Sawed-Off Shotgun
Although single-shot or double-barrel shotguns lend themselves best to being “sawed-off,” pump-actions can work if the tube magazine isn’t too long. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Gauge: varies (see the Shotguns 101 section of this guide)
most common with single-shot or double-barrel shotguns
In fiction, sawed-off shotguns are usually the domain of criminals, although any character could make use of one. It’s been illegal to shorten the barrel of a shotgun to less than 18 inches since the National Firearms Act of 1934. Shotguns intentionally manufactured with barrels of less than 18 inches require special NFA permits.
As explained elsewhere in this guide, the only benefits to a shortened barrel are mobility, concealment, and a wider shot pattern at close ranges. Ammunition determines firepower, not barrel length.
Single-shot and double-barrel shotguns are the most common choice for sawed-offs, since they would be the simplest to cut down. Pump-action shotguns could be shortened, but there’s more hardware getting in the way of those inches. The benefits wouldn’t be as great.
Bowie Knife
Bowie knives come in many varieties, but all share a common style. The tip is lower than the handle, as if the spine of the blade has been clipped out. (Photo courtesy of PointSeven Studios for BLADE.)
Type: fixed blade
Length: varies
The Bowie knife (pronounced “boo-eee,” not “bow-e”) is one of the most popular fixed blades in all of fiction, and it’s no wonder. It’s been around since at least the early 1800s. The Bowie occupies a unique place in Americana, rooted in the hard-nosed ruggedness of the nineteenth century.
The Bowie knife isn’t actually one model. It’s a style popularized by Jim Bowie in the infamous Sandbar Fight of 1827. Conveniently for writers, that style is still around today. A Bowie knife is defined as a fixed blade knife sporting a large blade with a concave design toward the tip. It looks as if part of the spine (the unsharpened edge at the top of the blade) has been carved out.
The Bowie style may apply to any knife type, but the classic is the fixed blade. When referring to a non-fixed blade knife, such as a folder, specify the knife type. So a folding knife with a Bowie-style blade would be written as “folding Bowie knife.” A “Bowie knife” references the fixed blade version of the knife.
Italian Stiletto Switchblades
How a switchblade is legally defined can change with the era and location. However, the Italian stiletto style will always be associated with switchblades. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Type: switchblade
Length: varies
As mentioned elsewhere, the Italian stiletto switchblade dominates fiction. Is it appropriate for writing modern settings? Probably not, since so many better options, such as assisted openers, are available—and they’re legal.
Antique and collectible switchblades are still in circulation where the law allows (if a state allows switchblades, and the commerce doesn’t cross state lines, then it’s legal). New switchblades are usually custom jobs and tough to find.
It’s not inaccurate to include Italian stilettos in fiction. Writers will score more points using folders, fixed blades, or assisted opening knives (if the story is set after the mid-1990s) instead.
Jimmy Lile First Blood Knife—The “Rambo Knife”
Sure, the famous “Rambo knife” looks flashy—it was made for a movie. From a practical standpoint, it’s bulkier, heavier, and more cumbersome than a smaller low-key knife. If looks matter in a story, go with this classic. If usefulness is important, stick to more mundane fixed blade knives. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Type: fixed blade
Length: varies, but usually on the larger side
Year introduced: 1982 (first in a movie, then imitated in the real world)
The screen adaptation of David Morrell’s novel First Blood introduced a knife that would become as famous as John Rambo himself (although the original novel didn’t feature such a knife). The original “Rambo knife,” as it became known (it was formally called First Blood, just like the movie), was a custom job by knife maker Jimmy Lile.
As the movie grew in popularity, so did the knife. It spawned countless imitators, becoming so popular that Rambo knife became a catchall term for any big, stylish combat or survival fixed blade knife.
Here’s the thing: Jimmy Lile designed the original knife for a movie. It needed to have a certain visual appeal. That’s why it worked in Hollywood. Reality is another story.
Soldiers probably aren’t eager to carry the Rambo knife into the field. It’s just not practical. It’s bulky, heavy, and not compatible with the efficient gear systems of most military organizations. Sure, a soldier could carry a Rambo knife—and writers are certainly free to use Rambo knives in their stories—but if one of the many modern, lightweight, durable, versatile knives available would work just as well, why not use one of those?
Top Shotguns
Benelli M4
The Benelli M4 semi-automatic shotgun comes in a variety of styles, but it primarily serves as a tactical firearm. Put it in the hands of a character ready to knock down some doors. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic shotgun
Gauge: 12
Capacity: five (civilian), seven (military and law enforcement)
Year introduced: 1999 (military); 2003 (civilian market)
In his book Gun Digest Book of the Tactical Shotgun, Scott Wagner writes that the M4 is “the Lincoln Continental of semi-automatic tactical shotguns.” The U.S. Marines agreed and adopted it in 1999. (Call it the M1014 when the military uses it in your writing.)
For law enforcement and military characters, the M4 can be the go-to semi-auto shotgun model. It’s recognized across the board as an excellent choice in the civilian market, too.
Because this is a semi-automatic, the character would only need to pull the trigger to fire. One trigger pull equals one shot fired—no need to pump anything to reload.
Browning Auto-5
The Browning Auto-5 is more popular with Joe Citizen than Johnny Law. That doesn’t mean it can’t show up in any number of scenarios, but it’s best to avoid giving it to military or law enforcement characters. They’d likely have better tactical options available. (Author’s photo.)
Type: semi-automatic shotgun
Gauges: 12 or 16
Capacity: five
Year introduced: 1903
The Benelli M4 is a great choice for modern semi-autos, but what about years ago? The Browning Auto-5 is a top pick for scattergun-wielding characters from the turn of the twentieth century through today.
Granted the Auto-5 is a sporting shotgun at heart. It’s popular with hunters, but it does find some use as a home defense gun. It’s probably not ideal for tactical purposes unless it’s been overhauled with custom parts. Military and law enforcement characters might opt for something else.
The Auto-5 changed hands throughout the years. At one point, Remington manufactured it. If you’re unsure of the maker, just write it as the “Auto-5.”
Remember that since this is a semi-automatic, there’s no need for pumping action in between shots. The gun reloads itself.
Browning Superposed
The Browning Superposed is a terrific choice for a character’s over-under or sawed-off shotgun. A gun enthusiast could talk all day about differences in over-unders, but writers can treat each model about the same. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: over-under shotgun
Gauges: 12, 20, 28, .410 (the .410 is actually referred to as a caliber)
Capacity: two (one shell inserted into each barrel; no pumping)
Year introduced: 1930
a good candidate for a character’s sawed-off shotgun
Over-under shotguns sport two barrels, one on top of the other. This classic setup is most often used for sport and hunting, but writers might choose to saw off the barrel for nefarious characters.
For writing purposes, there’s not a ton of difference in over-unders. The Browning Superposed is a no-fail pick, having been made from 1930 to 1986. It also comes in every common gauge, including the .410 (which is technically a caliber), so there’s plenty of versatility.
No matter how you write the Superposed (or other over-under) into a scene, don’t show a character pumping it.
Ithaca Model 37
In the decades since its introduction, the versatile Ithaca Model 37 shotgun has adapted to fit changing needs. With a few tweaks, such as the custom stock and pistol grip shown, it can shift from a classic sporting shotgun to a more tactical feel. It’s the perfect do-it-all shotgun. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: pump-action shotgun
Gauges: 12, 16, 20
Capacity: five, eight (extended magazine version)
Year introduced: 1937
many variations throughout the years
The Model 37 is a shotgun for the ages. It’s remained popular ever since it hit the market in 1937. Consider it the default choice for writing sporting or tactical shotguns. There’s no need to overthink this pick.
When assigning the Model 37 to military and law enforcement characters after 1968, take advantage of the extended magazine for extra shots. This feature is also available to civilians, but it’s not usually legal for hunting purposes.
The 12-gauge is the most popular version of the Model 37, and it offers the most firepower. It debuted in 1937. Two others followed: the 16-gauge in 1938 (discontinued in 1973) and the 20-gauge in 1939 (still available).
The Model 37 isn’t the only pump shotgun looming large. The Mossberg Model 500, Remington Model 870, and Winchester Model 12 (introduced in 1912) are all worthy of mention. For the sake of space, the Model 37 is this guide’s top pick for pumps.
Winchester Model 21
Side-by-side shotguns don’t have to be boring. Characters could saw off the barrels, throw on a couple of bayonets (one on each side of the barrels), or affix a laser sight. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: side-by-side shotgun
Gauges: 12, 16, 20, 28 (rare), .410 (rare)
Capacity: two (one shell inserted into each barrel; no pumping)
Year introduced: 1931
a good candidate for a character’s sawed-off shotgun
A side-by-side shotgun isn’t all that different from an over-under. The barrels are next to each other horizontally instead of vertically.
Writers have scores of side-by-sides to choose from. The Winchester Model 21 is a nice, practical choice. Saw the barrel off or have the character use it as is. There’s nothing too special about this particular model. It’s just a solid example of the form.
Although Winchester stopped making the Model 21 in 1991, it stayed in the side-by-side business. Write in the Model 21 if it fits the time frame. A generic “side-by-side shotgun,” “Winchester double-barreled shotgun” or “double-barreled shotgun” will also do the job.
Top Hunting and Sporting Rifles
Browning BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle)
Not to be confused with the other BAR for military use, this rifle of the same name is for sporting purposes. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Calibers: .243, .25-06, .270, .300, .30-06, .308, .325, .338, 7mm
Capacity: five (.243, .25-06, .270, .30-06, .308), four (.300, .325, .338, 7mm); use these capacities as a guideline since specific models can vary
Year introduced: 1967
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
Don’t confuse this with the fully automatic Browning BAR used by the U.S. military from World War I through the Vietnam War years. Despite the identical name, the BAR here is a semi-automatic sporting rifle and looks nothing like the military version. One pull of the trigger equals one shot fired. It’s immensely popular and successful, finding use primarily in the hunting arena. Writers should feel free to assign it to characters outside that spectrum, too.
Colt AR-15
Although it’s been around for decades, Colt’s AR-15, along with the many rifles emulating it, is a standard bearer for modern rifles today. Writers should feel free to customize it to their liking, as this is a firearm cut out for accessories. Just don’t write an AR-15 as a fully automatic—it’s a semi-automatic. One pull of the trigger equals one shot fired. (Photo courtesy of Colt.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Caliber: .223
Capacities: ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, fifty, others
Year introduced: 1964
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
Like the 1911 pistol, the Colt AR-15 represents both a stand-alone product and a platform emulated by other companies. Armalite produced the original AR-15 in 1958, which would later be adopted by the U.S. military as the fully automatic M16. That’s where the AR comes from in AR-15. It stands for Armalite, not assault rifle.
Armalite’s semi-automatic AR-15 didn’t make it to the civilian market until 1964, after Colt bought the design. Characters therefore wouldn’t be able to use an AR-15 until 1964, even though the design had been around for six years.
The AR-15 exploded in popularity in 2004, when the federal Assault Weapons Ban expired. It’s since been the flag bearer for modern sporting rifles used in shooting competitions and hunting. Characters might also use it for defensive or tactical purposes.
Keep in mind the AR-15 uses a detachable magazine, not a clip. It’s effective out to 200 yards or so, depending on the shooter.
With its low recoil and modern features, the AR-15 is generally a breeze to shoot. Characters of all stripes could use it after a brief rundown.
The AR-15 also lends itself well to customization. Writers needing a rifle with special add-ons may likely go with the AR-15.
Given the widespread imitation of the AR-15 by companies other than Colt, it’s acceptable to write AR-15 or AR-style rifle generically. However, when referring to both the manufacturer and the model specifically, write Colt AR-15. For example, Maynard might carry an AR-15 in a scene and I’d never mention the manufacturer of the firearm. But when Maynard specifically identifies a firearm as an AR-15 as a critical detail, it’d be a Colt AR-15.
Ruger 10/22
The Ruger 10/22 is an ideal default for a character’s semi-automatic .22 rifle. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Caliber: .22
Capacities: 10, 25, others depending on magazine
Year introduced: 1964; still produced today
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
The Ruger 10/22 is an excellent choice when writing about a .22 rifle. As one of the most popular rifles of all time, it’s a classic that Grandpa would appreciate, yet is timeless enough to appeal to new shooters.
Characters of all firearm skill levels would be able to operate the 10/22 without much difficulty. It’s one of the easiest rifles to shoot. As a semi-automatic, firing is as easy as pulling the trigger. No need to pump anything or to work a bolt-action.
The .22 doesn’t offer much in the way of firepower. Writers might find that ten (or twenty-five) well-placed shots can make up for the difference, though.
Winchester Model 70
Don’t be fooled by appearances. The Winchester Model 70 is as at home in the deer stand as it is in a SWAT operation. Writers searching for an all-purpose, bolt-action rifle to pop into a scene can stop looking. The Model 70 is it. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: bolt-action rifle
Calibers: .22, .223, .243, .250-3000, 7mm, .257, .264, .270, 7x57mm, .300, .30-06, .308, .338, .35, .358, .375, 9 x 57mm, 7.65mm, others
Capacities: three (magnum ammunition), five (standard)
Year introduced: 1936
uses an internal magazine built into the firearm, not a detachable one
Writers in need of a bolt-action rifle, look no further. The Model 70 is the standard for bolt-action rifles. Scores of variations manufactured over the decades make it an appropriate choice for civilian, law enforcement, and military characters. It’s an excellent all-around rifle that writers can use as a default for their characters.
Characters would not use a detachable magazine to load the Model 70. Instead they’d open the bolt action and manually insert cartridges one at a time into the internal magazine. A safety switch would be disengaged to fire. Characters would work the bolt action between each shot.
Feel free to modify this rifle with accessories depending on the character, but don’t up the ammo capacity.
Winchester Model 94
The Winchester Model 94 is an iconic lever-action rifle. It’s what comes to most readers’ minds when they picture that type of rifle. Writers can take advantage of that popularity and look knowledgeable at the same time by writing in one. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Repeating Arms Company for Gun Digest.)
Type: lever-action rifle
Calibers: .30-30, .44 mag., others
Capacities: six to eight depending on magazine/barrel length
Year introduced: 1964
uses a tube magazine that runs underneath the barrel
uses an external hammer
Sometimes a scene just isn’t complete without a lever-action rifle. In those cases, writers should jump right to the Model 94.
Winchester introduced this firearm in 1964 as an update of its popular Model 1894, which traces its history back to the “gun that won the West,” the Model 1873 (feel free to use those guns as you would the Model 94 for earlier settings). All that history might not matter for whatever you’re writing, but the Model 94’s lineage is impressive nonetheless.
The Model 94 finds most of its use today with hunters and hobbyists, but it wouldn’t look out of place for characters involved in other activities.
Ammunition is loaded one at a time into the side of the firearm above the trigger. The cartridges feed into a magazine tube, sort of like a shotgun’s.
To fire, a character would work the lever to chamber a cartridge. Doing so would simultaneously cock the external hammer. The rifle would be ready to fire. The character would pull the trigger, then work the lever to simultaneously eject the spent cartridge out the top of the firearm.
That external hammer acts as the safety. A character could load a cartridge into the chamber, then manually move the hammer forward into the safe position. When it’s time to shoot, the character could manually cock the hammer back, then fire.
Top Fully Automatic Firearms for Military Characters and More
Remember that machine guns use rifle ammunition and submachine guns use handgun ammunition. It’s better not to use the terms interchangeably.
AK-47
AK-47s don’t always have to be written into the hands of antagonists. Setting has more to do with their use in a story. Eastern countries, former or current communist countries, and the developing world are more likely to see use of the AK-47 across all character types. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: 7.62 × 39mm
Capacity: thirty
Year introduced: 1947
appropriate to refer to as an assault rifle, but not assault weapon
formally introduced in 1947
When the Soviet Union unofficially introduced the AK-47 during its “Great Patriotic War” of 1941–1945, it changed the world of firearms forever. The firearm’s fame—or infamy—grew to such heights that it’s even featured on the flag of Mozambique.
That should tell writers something. The proliferation of these “Russian bullet hoses” across the planet makes them the default firearm for international characters, usually but not always members of military and criminal organizations. AK-47s are typically found in former or current communist countries and the developing world. They aren’t as popular in developed Western countries.
The AK in AK-47 stands for Avtomat Kalashnikov, the latter word being the last name of its inventor. The 47 stands for the year it was formally introduced, 1947. Writing the AK-47 into a World War II setting is an easy pitfall that you should avoid.
The appeal of the AK-47 is its simplicity. A character unfamiliar with an AK-47 could figure out how to use it in a few minutes. It’s also a reliable, hardy weapon even in extreme conditions.
The trade-off is that the AK-47 is relatively inaccurate. Cycling ammunition through the firearm is a violent process, throwing off the shooter’s aim with each shot. The AK-47 drops off in accuracy beyond about 100 yards.
Scores of variations of the AK-47 exist, often because they were assembled by hand through the years. For writing, go with the standard thirty-round version.
One last note: An updated model appeared in 1974, called the AK-74. Designers tried to improve accuracy. However, it didn’t gain nearly as much global popularity as the AK-47.
Colt Model 635
The Colt Model 635 is an off-the-beaten-path pick for submachine guns. It’s a great alternative to the Uzi trope. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic submachine gun
Caliber: 9mm
Capacities: twenty or thirty-two
Year introduced: 1990
can switch to semi-automatic mode (select-fire)
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
The Model 635 is a firecracker of a submachine gun. Colt based the design on the popular M16, knocking down the size and caliber.
The Model 635 fires at a rate of 900 rounds per minute, but that’s just for measurement’s sake. Keep in mind the magazine would hold thirty-two rounds at most. Reloading would eat up much of that minute.
The 635 never gained much popularity with the U.S. military, but it is used in other countries. However, it’s a great pick for criminal characters as an alternative to the Uzi cliché.
Colt M16
The Colt M16 is perhaps the most iconic rifle in the U.S. military. It’s been in service since the Vietnam era, so make it a default pick for U.S. military characters. As a select-fire rifle, it can switch between semi-automatic, burst, and fully automatic modes. The civilian version, available only as a semi-automatic, is called the Colt AR-15. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: 5.56 × 45mm (acceptable to write as just 5.56mm)
Capacity: twenty
Year introduced: 1962
can switch to semi-automatic mode or three-round burst mode (select-fire)
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
Are you writing U.S. military characters? The M16 should be the default choice for their machine guns. The M16 can trace its roots back to the 1950s with Armalite’s AR-15 rifle (later purchased by Colt). The AR-15 caught the attention of the U.S. military, which formally adopted the rifle as the M16 in 1962.
While the firearm was and is at the frontlines of many conflicts, it became iconic in Vietnam. It’s now the go-to machine gun for military characters.
In 2010, the U.S. military announced it was seeking a replacement for the M16, but as of this writing, that hasn’t come to fruition.
Note the AR-15 that’s available on the civilian market is not the same as the M16. The civilian version is offered only in semi-automatic form. When referencing ammunition used by the civilian AR-15, call it .223 (roughly equivalent to 5.56mm). For the M16, call it 5.56mm (or, to show off even more, 5.56 × 45mm).
Don’t forget: M16s are primed for grenade launcher add-ons if writers need them. They’d sit below the barrel, allowing the shooter to continue using the firearm normally.
Colt M4
The Colt M4 is like a smaller version of the iconic M16. Assign it to U.S. military characters from 1994 and later. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: 5.56 × 45mm (acceptable to write as just 5.56mm)
Capacity: thirty
Year introduced: 1994
can switch to semi-automatic mode or three-round burst mode
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
The M4 represents the next step in the evolution of the M16. Colt originally manufactured it for U.S. Special Forces in 1994. It went on to serve in most other areas of the military.
As a carbine, it’s basically a smaller version of the M16. Many versions of the M4 exist. For the sake of simplicity, just write it as “M4.”
Like the M16, the M4 is a prime pick for U.S. military characters. It’s also up for replacement as of this writing.
Fabrique Nationale Herstal Fusil Automatique Leger (aka FN FAL)
The FN FAL then and now. The FAL is found in nearly every Western country’s military and police forces in some capacity. (Photos courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: 7.62 × 51mm (acceptable to write it simply as 7.62mm)
Capacity: twenty
Year introduced: 1953
uses a detachable magazine
can switch between semi-automatic and fully automatic modes (select-fire)
More than ninety of the world’s militaries (mostly Western countries) adopted the FN FAL after it launched in 1953. As one of the most successful machine guns of all time, the FN FAL (don’t bother writing out its formal name) is still in use across the globe.
For writing, think of the FN FAL as the Western equivalent of the AK-47. It’s found around the world, fires relatively easy-to-obtain ammunition, and is a real workhorse. Go with the FAL if putting an AK-47 into a character’s hands doesn’t feel right. When a character does use it, the FAL would be effective at ranges out to 100 yards and beyond.
Just for perspective on that ammunition, 7.62 × 51mm is roughly equivalent to a .308 caliber cartridge.
Heckler & Koch MP5
It’s not uncommon for some MP5s to sport a folding stock and suppressor, as shown here. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic submachine gun
Calibers: 9mm (most common), .40, 10mm
Capacities: fifteen or thirty
Year introduced: 1966
can switch to semi-automatic mode or a burst mode that fires three rounds per trigger pull (select-fire)
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
Militaries across the Western world adopted the MP5 after it was introduced in West Germany in 1966. It’s the perfect fit for military characters or individuals with access to this type of weaponry. Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, use the MP5, too.
Heckler & Koch cranked out many variations of the MP5, and the firearm is still manufactured. Just write it as “MP5” no matter the time frame. It’ll get the point across.
Fabrique Nationale Herstal USA Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (aka SCAR)
The SCAR is a modern pick for Western characters, especially those in militaries. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Calibers: 5.56 × 45mm or 7.62 × 51mm (acceptable to write as 5.56mm or 7.62mm)
Capacities: twenty or thirty
Year introduced: 2005
uses a detachable magazine
can switch between semi-automatic and fully automatic modes (select-fire)
Is it any wonder this gun goes by SCAR instead of its full name? Go ahead and write it that way instead.
The SCAR took over from the M4 in the mid-2000s as the primary rifle for the U.S. Special Forces. However, the SCAR isn’t just one rifle. It’s a family of firearms, with names like Mk 16, Mk 17, and others.
Spelling out the differences within this family is more suited to technical books like Gun Digest. For the sake of writing, pick a caliber and call it a “SCAR.” The 5.56mm version (equal to the .223) is lighter, while the 7.62mm (equivalent to the .308 caliber) model is heavier.
The SCAR would pair well with military characters, but don’t feel limited. For example, a crime lord with good taste in modern firearms might get ahold of some SCARs to help take care of business.
Steyr Armee Universal Gewehr (aka Steyr AUG)
The Steyr AUG’s bullpup design makes it operable with one hand, although two is best. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: 5.56 × 45mm (acceptable to write as 5.56mm)
Capacities: thirty or forty-two
Year introduced: 1978
uses a detachable magazine
bullpup magazine (magazine is located behind the trigger)
can switch between semi-automatic and fully automatic modes (select-fire)
For a change-up in the looks department, the Steyr AUG is worth a shot. It’s a bullpup, meaning the detachable magazine and action are located a few inches behind the trigger, not in front. This allows for a more compact design without downgrading into a smaller caliber. For experienced characters, one-handed operation is possible.
The AUG is a product of Austria, but it’s a go-to bullpup for militaries and police forces around the world. Federal agencies in the United States even use it.
Translated out of the metric system, the 5.56mm is equivalent to the .223 caliber.
Top Picks for Military Firearms of Yesteryear
Browning Automatic Rifle (Model 1918)
Allied characters from World War I and II would’ve been familiar with the BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle). When used by the U.S. military, this firearm is called the M1918 or Model 1918. (Photo courtesy of Jim Thompson for Gun Digest.)
Type: fully automatic machine gun
Caliber: .30-06
Capacity: twenty
Year introduced: 1917
uses a detachable magazine
can switch between semi-automatic and fully automatic modes (select-fire)
Two firearms go by the Browning Automatic Rifle name. One is for hunting; the other is for the military. I’ve already discussed the former; this is the latter.
Colt, Marlin, and Winchester all produced the BAR (it’s acceptable to use the abbreviation) from 1917 to 1945. The firearm saw service through the Korean War, too, before phasing out. It wouldn’t be out of place for military characters through the Vietnam War to use one.
The BAR is ideal for U.S. and allied military characters during those time periods. Civilian and criminal characters might also use it, especially after World War I through 1934. That’s when the National Firearms Act when into effect, making it more difficult to obtain the BAR.
Weighing around 18 pounds, the BAR is on the heavy side. The benefit of laying down a hard cloud of .30-06 makes it worth the effort.
Springfield Armory M1 Garand
The M1 Garand represents one of the few firearms for which it’s accurate to write clip instead of magazine. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Caliber: .30-06
Capacity: eight
Year introduced: 1936
uses a clip (not a detachable magazine)
Well, well, well, take a look at that. It’s a firearm that uses a clip instead of a detachable magazine. Yes, writers, this is one firearm where writing clip is actually the preferred term.
The M1 Garand’s clip would be loaded with eight .30-06 rounds. The clip would then be inserted into the rifle’s internal magazine. The clip would pop out with a familiar, metallic ping sound once all eight rounds were fired.
The U.S. military adopted the M1 Garand as its standard-issue rifle from 1936 to 1957. Its significance in World War II and the Korean War can’t be overstated. More than 5.4 million were manufactured.
Characters outside the military might use a Garand, too. Its accuracy and reliability made it a favorite for sport and hunting. Writers should feel free to attach a bayonet to the Garand if needed.
SKS
The SKS is the underappreciated cousin of the AK-47. This semi-automatic rifle sports a bayonet that swings outward to deploy. The bayonet is visible in its ready position in this image, located just to the left of the tip of the barrel. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Caliber: 7.62 × 39mm (acceptable to write as just 7.62mm)
Capacity: ten
Year introduced: 1946
uses a clip (not a detachable magazine)
Think of the SKS as the Soviet Union’s take on the M1 Garand. After World War II, it became a primary semi-automatic rifle for the Soviet Union and its allies. It’s perfect for midcentury characters from communist countries, including China.
Like the Garand, the SKS uses a clip (yes, I said clip) of ammunition that’s inserted into the rifle’s internal magazine. The SKS uses a flip-out bayonet that swings open when deployed.
It’d be unlikely for a character from the West to use an SKS prior to the early 1990s, unless the SKS was captured in combat. But one should note that it’s a mistake to feature the SKS in World War II–era stories. The SKS arrived one year after the war ended. Soviet characters during World War II might use the semi-automatic Tokarev M1938 (ten-round detachable magazine, fifteen rounds for the select-fire version) or the Tokarev M1940 (semi-auto, ten-round detachable magazine) rifles. Among others, both were common in the hands of Soviet soldiers during that time.
Mauser Model 98
Scores of Mauser Model 98 firearms were produced from the late 1800s through World War II. This variation, a 98K, is from the World War II era. If Nazis are the antagonists in your story, chances are good they’re using the 98 as the bolt-action rifle of choice. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: bolt-action rifle
Caliber: 7.92 × 57mm (acceptable to write as 7.92mm)
Capacity: five
Year introduced: 1898
uses a clip (not a detachable magazine)
Germany’s military used the Model 98 in both world wars, making it a top pick for Nazi characters.
Loading the Model 98 requires a clip of five rounds inserted into an internal magazine. Again, this is a firearm where writing clip is accurate.
The Model 98 also goes by names Gewehr 98, M98, G98, Gew 98, and others. It’s acceptable to use any of these when writing.
Characters outside the military and Germany might use the Model 98, too. Countries allied with or occupied by Germany during the world wars certainly would use it. However, after World War II, the Model 98 phased out of service.
Top Sniper Rifles
Any rifle used to take a character out from a distance could qualify as a sniper rifle. For writers looking to really “reach out and touch someone” in a scene, here are some head-splitting considerations.
Armalite AR-30
Why would a character use a sniper rifle in .338 Lapua, the ammunition this AR-30 uses, over pop culture’s favorite, the .50 caliber? The .338 Lapua is generally thought to be more accurate. Of course, accuracy ultimately depends on the shooter, but it’s a worthy consideration when writing. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: bolt-action rifle
Caliber: .338 Lapua
Capacity: five
Year introduced: 2000
uses a detachable magazine
For nailing characters at distances up to a half mile away, the AR-30 is a great choice. It’ll leave an unforgettable mark on its target, easily adhering to the “one shot, one kill” maxim.
That great firepower requires great responsibility, though. This is a rifle for experienced characters only. Being accurate requires a proper shooting position, usually from a flat surface and assisted by a bipod. It also requires some physical dexterity, since the AR-30 is large and heavy.
The AR-30 is available in other calibers, but the .338 Lapua is most beneficial for fiction. It’ll plow lead through just about anything.
Barrett Model 82
The updated version of the Barrett Model 82 from the 1980s is called the Model 82A1. Don’t worry too much about that detail when writing. Just call it the Model 82. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic rifle
Caliber: .50
Capacity: ten
Year introduced: 1982
uses a detachable magazine
The Barrett Model 82 is what’s known as an anti-materiel rifle. This means it’s designed to put holes in vehicles, buildings, and anything else that gets in the way. Characters taking hits from the Model 82’s massive payload wouldn’t just bleed—they’d drop weight.
The 82 didn’t gain much popularity until the first Gulf War (1990–1991), when the U.S. Marine Corps made use of it. The 82 punched through Iraqi trucks, aircraft on the ground, and military equipment, as well as soldiers. Since then, military and law enforcement organizations around the world adopted the 82 for any number of scenarios. When the U.S. military uses it, it’s actually called the M107 (or M107A1 for more recent years).
For writers, the 82 is the go-to pick for long-distance, heavy-hitting shots anywhere in the world from 1982 onward. Assign it to characters with a lot of firearm know-how, though. This isn’t Grandma’s rifle, although she could certainly buy one on the U.S. civilian market in places where the law allows.
Keep in mind that this rifle is usually accompanied by a bipod fixed beneath the barrel. Characters would likely shoot the 82 from a resting position.
McMillan TAC-50
The McMillan Tac-50: the Cadillac of modern sniper rifles. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: bolt-action rifle
Caliber: .50
Capacity: five
Year introduced: late 1980s
uses a detachable magazine (not a clip)
effective to 2,000 yards and beyond
The TAC-50 is the Cadillac of modern sniper rifles. For writing, it can be useful for characters firing at extreme ranges up to a mile or more.
Wait. A mile? Really?
Believe it. The TAC-50 held the record for the longest confirmed sniper kill until 2009. Rob Furlong, a sniper in the Canadian military, made his record-setting shot in Afghanistan at 2,657 yards—or about a mile and a half—in 2002.
Assign the TAC-50 to military, law enforcement, and U.S. civilian characters (check state and local laws, especially in California). The popularity of the TAC-50 also makes it a prime choice for international characters. Characters would need to be expert shooters to make a successful shot. This isn’t Grandpa’s squirrel rifle.
The TAC-50 is best used with its built-in bipod deployed. The shooter should be in a resting position. Be sure to consider those details when writing.
When the U.S. military uses the TAC-50, it’s called the Mk 15 (this designation started in the early 2000s). The Canadian military calls it a C15.
Top Revolvers for Private Eyes, Gunslingers, and More
Revolvers occupy a special place in fiction, especially the crime genre. It’s often the handgun type of choice for protagonists, perhaps because of its Old West heritage.
Colt Anaconda
The Colt Anaconda, along with its sister model the Colt Python, is a great pick for characters needing a modern revolver that packs a punch. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Calibers: .44 magnum, .45 (not introduced until 1993)
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1990
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
The Anaconda makes the list as a revolver with serious firepower that doesn’t require the hammer be cocked prior to pulling the trigger. It’s a double-action revolver.
Only characters with a strong command of handguns should use the Anaconda. All that firepower can be hard to handle.
The Anaconda continued the reptilian streak Colt started in 1955 with the Python (available in .357 magnum and .38 Special, double-action, external hammer, and six-shooter). Both are solid choices for double-action revolvers.
Colt Single-Action Army (aka “Peacemaker” or “Colt 45”)
Not every Colt Single Action Army revolver is an antique. Colt has continuously produced the handguns since 1873. They all sport an iconic Old West design. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Caliber: .45, but also available in nearly all the others
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1873
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before each shot)
The “Dirty Harry Revolver” may own the night in much of crime fiction, but no single revolver can come close to the iconic Colt Single-Action Army.
Whether you call it the “Peacemaker,” the “Colt 45,” or the “Colt SAA,” it’s the quintessential revolver. As a testament to its popularity, it’s still manufactured today. Assign it to any character anywhere in the world from 1873 onward. It’ll hurl bullets nicely in any genre, from Westerns and crime fiction to thrillers and steampunk.
The only potential drawback for fiction is in the looks department. Despite many variations, there’s no getting around the Old West aesthetics. That appearance could seem out of place depending on the character or setting.
The question sometimes comes up whether an antique Single-Action Army could be fired successfully today. The answer depends on the condition of the firearm. Use your creative license: It’s possible to fire an antique today without raising too many eyebrows.
Ruger Blackhawk
Looking for a classic revolver without delving too far into Old West territory? Write in a Ruger Blackhawk. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Calibers: .45, .41, .357, .30
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1962
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before each shot)
For a more modern feel to the classic six-shooter, give characters the Ruger Blackhawk. It knocks out heavy-hitting .45 ammunition just like the Colt Single-Action Army does, minus the cowboy spirit.
Ruger Single Six
As a .22, the Ruger Single Six won’t give the character shooting it a black eye. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Caliber: .22
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1953
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before each shot)
Characters don’t necessarily need a hand cannon to leave a crater in a target. Sometimes an easy-to-shoot, small-caliber revolver will do the job.
For those situations, write in the Ruger Single Six. As a .22 caliber, it’s ideal for characters new to handguns. It sports a longer barrel—51⁄2 inches is a common version—that makes it more accurate, too.
Smith & Wesson Model 27
Introduced in the 1930s, the Smith & Wesson Model 27 is an enduring, classic revolver. It’s a prime pick for detective characters. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Caliber: .357 magnum, .38 Special
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 1935
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
Need a go-to revolver for law enforcement characters? Writers could do a lot worse than the Smith & Wesson Model 27. It’s still manufactured to this day, although its use by law enforcement isn’t as common as it was when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover kept one at his side.
Civilian characters might also use the Model 27. Unlike other types of firearms, revolvers are subject to fewer restrictions. If law enforcement can use a certain revolver, chances are a civilian can, too. Note that it took until 1948 for this revolver to receive the Model 27 name. For settings from 1935 to 1948, write it as the “Factory Registered .357 Magnum.”
Taurus Judge
The Taurus Judge can fire .45 cartridges and .410 shotshells. It’s a shotgun/revolver hybrid that could make for some interesting scenes. Pictured is the Raging Judge, a magnum version. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: revolver
Calibers: .45, .410 shotshells
Capacity: five
Year introduced: 2007
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
Here’s a revolver writers can have a lot of fun with, depending on how sinister that “fun” is defined. The Taurus Judge can fire .45 ammunition or .410 shotshells (BBs). It’s a shotgun in a handgun. Any combination of ammunition will work, such as two .45s and three .410s or four .45s and one .410.
A character might appreciate a .410 shotshell in self-defense situations. A writer might use it for an off-the-beaten-path firearm depiction. Either way, keep in mind that firing the .410 makes a donut of the shot pattern. Because the barrel is rifled, the BBs spin as they exit the firearm. This creates a donut shape. Depict injuries likewise.
In the real world, the Judge is either loved or loathed. Some see it as a versatile defense handgun. Others question the practicality of a shot pattern that disperses into irrelevancy beyond intimate ranges. Either way, writers are sure to find creative uses for this popular revolver.
Top Pistols for Law Enforcement and Other Characters
Keep in mind that individual law enforcement organizations often assign or recommend firearms for its members. There isn’t a single “cop gun” out there. What follows are suggestions for law enforcement characters, but it’s not a blanket statement. Feel free to assign these firearms to civilians, too.
Beretta 92
The Beretta Model 92 is a perfect choice for law enforcement characters. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: 9mm (don’t write this as .9mm)
Capacity: ten, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, twenty
Year introduced: 1975
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
Few pistols can come close to the reliability of the Beretta 92. That’s probably why so many law enforcement and military organizations worldwide (Beretta is an Italian company) adopted it after its introduction in 1975.
Several variations of the 92 exist. The United States military adopted the 92 in the mid-1980s. When used by military characters, this gun is called the M9. The M9 is nearly identical to the civilian/law enforcement version (the 92).
Just remember: Unlike Glocks, the Beretta 92 has an ambidextrous safety switch to flip off before firing.
Browning Hi-Power
Fiction’s fixation on Glocks can cause classics like the Browning Hi-Power to get sidelined. Don’t skip this one, writers. The Hi-Power is a versatile pistol ready for use in many settings and scenarios. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: 9mm (don’t write this as .9mm)
Capacity: thirteen, twenty
Year introduced: 1935
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before first shot)
slide-action
Stories set prior to the advent of the Beretta 92 and Glock 17 aren’t out of luck when it comes to police pistols. Before those two giants cast a long shadow over the handgun scene, the Browning Hi-Power (also spelled Hi Power) ruled the roost. It still does in many respects.
The Hi-Power hit the market shortly before World War II, which benefitted its popularity. Both the Nazis and the Western Allies used the Hi-Power, which led to its use in militaries and law enforcement organizations around the world.
In his book Massad Ayoob’s Greatest Handguns of the World, Volume II, the author writes, “No handgun has been so universally accepted by the free world.” That goes for police and military forces in South America, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, parts of eastern Europe, and, of course, the United States.
The Hi-Power is a universal pick for writing law enforcement, military, and civilian characters. Just remember to have them thumb off the safety switch.
CZ 75
Characters from communist countries during the Cold War might use the CZ 75, although it was never formally adopted by the militaries of the Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries. They’ve since proliferated across the West. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Calibers: 9mm (most common), .40
Capacities: sixteen, others depending on variation
Year introduced: 1975
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
Writers might be interested in the claim CZ posts on its website: “[The CZ 75] is used by more governments, militaries, police, and security agencies than any other pistol in the world.”
Manufacturers like to brag in this way, but for the sake of writing it’s true enough. The CZ 75 doesn’t have the film and fiction presence of other models, but it’s a big deal in the real world.
Here’s the tricky part about writing the CZ 75. Due to some convoluted patent arrangements, manufacturers in countries around the world were free to make their own clones. These copycats drove demand for the CZ 75 up until trade relations improved after the Cold War. Mention a characters’ fake CZ 75 for an added touch of realism.
Glock
It’s hard to go wrong giving law enforcement characters, or just about anyone, a Glock. Just remember that Glock refers to a brand, even if the word is sometimes treated like the Kleenex of handguns. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Calibers: .45, .357, 10mm, .40, 9mm, .380
Capacity: varies
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
no safety switch to thumb off
despite using plastic components, will not cheat metal detectors
When the term Glock is used in fiction, I get the feeling it’s a placeholder for “modern-looking semi-automatic pistol.” This is a credit to Glock, the company, for making its early 1980s pistols such a success with law enforcement and civilians.
However, the word Glock refers to the company, not a particular gun model, of which Glock makes many. The most iconic model is the one that launched the company in 1982, the Glock 17. It’s still popular today and is a great choice for civilian or law enforcement characters.
For those who are curious, the Glock 17 holds seventeen rounds of 9mm ammunition, although extended magazines can get up to nineteen or thirty-three. Like all Glocks, it doesn’t come with a traditional safety that needs to be switched on or off. Instead it has a trigger safety, which is a small tab on the trigger that must be pressed before the trigger can be pulled.
Glocks also use a slide-action. The slide on top of the firearm must be racked to load the first shell from the magazine into the chamber.
Writers unsure of what kind of Glock a character is using should go straight to the Glock 17. For accuracy’s sake, it’s hard to go wrong. Glocks from the 1980s are still around today, performing as well as they did when first introduced.
Here’s a bit of Glock trivia that could come in handy: The company actually made a fully automatic pistol for law enforcement and military organizations. It’s called the Glock 18. Although its best use may be as forum fodder online, it could be the perfect match for a character in fiction.
Also, the 1988 Undetectable Firearms Act (UFA) passed into federal law largely in response to the Glock 17’s plastic components. Some thought the Glock 17 was able to cheat metal detectors or that its plastic parts marked a forthcoming undetectable handgun. History showed that wasn’t true. Read the section on improvised and custom firearms for more perspective on the UFA.
Sig Sauer P226
The Sig Sauer P226 is used in some capacity by just about every military and law enforcement organization in the U.S. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Calibers: 9mm, .40, .357
Capacity: fifteen or twenty (9mm), ten or twelve (.357 and .40)
Year introduced: 1983; .357 version introduced in 1996
double-action (no need to cock the hammer first; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
Most of the pistols on this list are in 9mm. Writers looking for a little variety might go with the Sig Sauer P226 to change things up. The .40 and .357 versions offer a bit more bite than the 9mm.
The P226’s main appeal is in its ergonomics. It’s a larger handgun that’s not too clunky to hold.
Assign the P226 to military and law enforcement characters. The Sig Sauer website lists the Texas Rangers, Ohio Highway Patrol, Michigan State Police, and the U.S. Navy Seals as just a few of the agencies using the P226.
Top Handguns for Spies
Spy characters could use any number of handguns. For the purposes of this guide, it’s assumed spies need small firearms that are easy to hide on (or in) the body. These small handguns are typically known as derringers, mouse guns, or pocket pistols.
Beretta Model 418
Before James Bond famously started using the Walther PPK, Ian Fleming outfitted him with a .25 caliber Beretta Model 418. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: .25
Capacity: eight
Year introduced: 1947
single-action
slide-action
known as the “Bantam” in the U.S. market
Ian Fleming’s early James Bond novels saw the secret agent carrying this .25 caliber Beretta.
The 418 is the “lady’s gun” Bond reader Geoffrey Boothroyd wrote about in a letter to Fleming. He suggested something with more punch. This led to Bond’s switch to the Walther PPK.
The .25 is indeed a light caliber, but Fleming—a former secret operative himself—likely put more stock in accuracy than firepower. This led him to eventually settle on the .32 caliber PPK, which isn’t much larger than the .25 Model 418.
Characters should take the same approach when using the 418. This is a compact firearm for finesse work. Accuracy definitely matters if a character can’t handle a hand cannon. There’s nothing disparaging about a character, male or female, with dead-on aim.
Boberg Arms XR45-S
Boberg Arms also makes the XR-9, shown here, which is similar in appearance to the XR45-S but comes in 9mm. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: .45
Capacity: seven
Year introduced: 2014
double-action (no need to cock a hammer before firing; just pull the trigger)
Writers on the cutting edge might choose the Boberg Arms XR45-S for a stealthy character. Billed as the “world’s smallest semi-auto .45,” it stuffs seven rounds of hard-hitting ammunition into a tiny pistol.
Whether this is a good idea depends on the character using it. The manufacturer’s website claims the pistol is “extremely accurate.” This would seem to run counter to the longer-barrels-equal-better accuracy rule; more likely it’s on target at intimate ranges.
When firing, the character should hang on tight. This pistol’s tiny frame will have a tough time managing the recoil of .45 cartridges.
Bottom line: The XR45-S is proof that downsizing doesn’t have to mean sacrificing firepower, but accuracy will certainly be compromised.
Bond Arms Texas Defender
Spies and other covert characters might appreciate the compact design of the Bond Arms Texas Defender. Writers may like its unusual aesthetics. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: over-under pistol
Calibers: .45, .44, .357 magnum, .40, 10mm, 9mm, .32, .22, .410
Capacity: two
Year introduced: 1997
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before each shot)
3-inch barrel
An over-under pistol? The Texas Defender is just that, sporting one barrel on top of the other. Those barrels can be interchanged depending on the caliber used, making it a versatile pick for the well-equipped character.
Firing the Texas Defender requires first cocking the hammer, then pulling the trigger. Repeat to fire the second barrel. If that sounds a little like a revolver, don’t be confused. It’s still a pistol because the chambers are stationary and don’t rotate in a cylinder.
Note that the Texas Defender will fire a .410 shotshell. Like the Taurus Judge, mentioned earlier, it offers shotgun performance in a handgun. Have fun with that, writers.
Iver Johnson Arms Frontier Four Derringer
The Iver Johnson Arms Frontier Four is nearly identical to a Sharps four-barrel derringer design from the mid-1800s (shown here). This type of derringer is sometimes called a “pepperbox.” Feel free to include one from the 1850s through today. They’re great for settling poker disputes. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Type: pistol
Caliber: .22
Capacity: four
Year introduced: 2006
single-action (hammer must be cocked manually before firing each shot)
quad-barreled
The Frontier Four stands out for its four barrels. That’s not a typo. This derringer (another term for a small pistol) uses a rotating firing pin to shoot .22 ammunition out of four barrels. It’s not a revolver, though, because the chambers are stationary. This sounds gimmicky, but it’s effective at intimate ranges of a few yards. Because it’s a single-action, its hammer must be manually cocked before each shot.
Ruger LCP
As far as compact, modern handguns go, the Ruger LCP is at the front of its class. Between its size and quick use, the LCP is both the cloak and the dagger rolled into one. (Photo courtesy of Ruger.)
Type: semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: .380
Capacity: six
Year introduced: 2008
double-action (no need to cock a hammer before firing; just pull the trigger)
slide-action
23⁄4-inch barrel
Ruger revived the derringer market in 2008 with the LCP, which stands for lightweight compact pistol. It’s just that, which makes it a top choice for the modern spy character.
Top Switchblades, Automatics, and Assisted Opening Knives
Note: The classic Italian stiletto switchblade is covered earlier in the Hit List.
Kershaw Leek
The Kershaw Leek comes in just about any color. The most common is gray, but the flashy, rainbow version is popular, too. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Type: assisted opening knife
Blade length: 3 inches
Length closed: 4 inches
Length open: 7 inches
Year introduced: 1998
As one of the first assisted openers, this knife helped to change the industry in the late 1990s. To the untrained eye, the Leek would appear to operate like a switchblade. The blade swoops open from inside the handle, fast as a blink.
However, the mechanics are nothing like a switchblade. Unlike switchblades, the Leek’s blade is biased to stay inside the handle. The user doesn’t press a button or switch on the handle to eject the blade. Instead, a part of the blade itself, a tab, is pressed. This opens the blade halfway. Then an “assisting” mechanism takes over and pushes the blade the rest of the way out. The whole thing happens in a fraction of a second.
Legally this means the Leek is not a switchblade. It’s an incredibly popular knife in the civilian market for that reason.
Many other assisted openers exist, but this is a go-to model.
SOG Aegis
If the laws of the setting won’t allow a character to carry a switchblade or automatic knife, an assisted opener may be a better fit. And if that assisted opener needs to stand up to tough conditions, the SOG Aegis is a prime pick. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: assisted opening knife
Blade length: 31⁄2 inches
Length closed: 43⁄4 inches
Length open: 81⁄4 inches
Introduced: early 2000s
For as ubiquitous as the Leek is on the market, it’s not cut out for hard use. That can matter in a fight scene.
The SOG Aegis is a great alternative. It’s an assisted opener with a tactical brain. It’d work well for any character in need of a quick and effective weapon.
Pro-Tech TR-3
If a character in a story set in recent years needs to carry a switchblade, consider outfitting him or her with a modern automatic knife, such as a Protech TR-3. Automatic knives are the modern equivalent of switchblades. They use the latest designs and materials. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: automatic knife
Blade length: 31⁄2 inches
Length closed: 41⁄2 inches
Length open: 8 inches
Introduced: mid-2000s
Law enforcement and military characters don’t need to mess around with assisted openers. They can obtain automatic knives (the term for modern switchblades).
The Pro-Tech TR-3 is a great choice for those modern characters. The character would press a button on the handle to open the blade from the side. Although it’s an automatic, the TR-3 is one of the tougher models available. It’d hold up well in a fight scene.
Spyderco Embassy
Assign the Spyderco Embassy automatic knife to law enforcement characters and others able (or just willing) to carry restricted knives. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: automatic knife
Blade length: 31⁄8 inches
Length closed: 49⁄32 inches
Length open: 73⁄8 inches
Year introduced: 2008
From a writing standpoint, the Spyderco Embassy is not all that different from the Pro-Tech TR-3. The Embassy is popular with the law enforcement crowd, so it’s worth mentioning.
Benchmade Infidel
No, the name isn’t very politically correct. But the Benchmade Infidel is a prime example of an OTF (out the front) knife suitable as a modern alternative to the classic switchblade. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: OTF (out the front) automatic knife
Blade length: 39⁄10 inches
Length closed: 5 inches
Length open: 89⁄10 inches
Year introduced: 2006
If vanilla automatic knives or Italian stiletto switchblades just aren’t enough, go with the Benchmade Infidel. It’s an OTF, or “out the front,” automatic. That means the blade comes out the front of the handle instead of the side. The character would need to push a slide forward to release the blade. Getting the blade back inside involves slipping the slide backward.
Military, law enforcement, and criminal characters are more likely than civilians to have an Infidel or any other automatic knife. Civilian characters would have to live in an area that permits switchblades in order to buy one.
Top Folding Knives
Buck 110
The classic Buck 110: the essential folding hunting knife. (Photo courtesy of Buck.)
Blade length: 33⁄4 inches
Length closed: 47⁄8 inches
Length open: 85⁄8 inches
Year introduced: 1964
The Buck 110 is the template for folding hunting knives. Give it to outdoorsy characters or any character in need of a simple, reliable folding knife. Few folders can match the popularity of the Buck 110.
However, the Buck 110 isn’t the best choice for fighting. It’s a great knife, but it’s meant for use outdoors and for everyday tasks.
Emerson CQC
The Emerson CQC has “close quarters combat” built into its name. Characters might use it for just that. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Blade length: 31⁄3 inches
Length closed: 42⁄3 inches
Length open: 8 inches
Year introduced: 1994
The Emerson CQC (close-quarters combat) is a true tactical folding knife. Its designer, Ernest Emerson, helped launch tactical folding knives in the 1980s. Any character anticipating a fight could confidently carry one.
Many variations of the CQC exist. The specs listed are for the CQC-7, which is one of the most popular.
Writers needing a knife similar to the CQC-7 but in a slightly earlier time period might check out the CQC-6, introduced in 1989.
Gerber LST
The Gerber LST is an all-purpose folding knife for characters from the 1980s and beyond. It’s nothing too fancy but might be worth writing instead of a generic folding knife if it matters to the story. (Photo courtesy of Gerber for BLADE.)
Blade length: 22⁄3 inches
Length closed: 32⁄3 inches
Length open: 61⁄10 inches
Year introduced: 1980
The Gerber LST is a great choice for stories set in the Reagan years. It fills the gap between the old school Buck 110 of 1964 and Spyderco’s Delica/Endura models in the 1990s. It’s mentioned here for that reason, so heads up 1980s writers.
Performance-wise, this is an all-around knife with a smart design. It would go well with a similar kind of character.
Spyderco Delica/Endura
The Spyderco Endura (top) and Delica (bottom) are two popular folding knives. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Delica blade length: 27⁄8 inches
Delica length closed: 41⁄4 inches
Delica length open: 71⁄8 inches
Endura blade length: 33⁄4 inches
Endura length closed: 5 inches
Endura length open: 83⁄4 inches
Year introduced: 1990
The Spyderco Delica and Spyderco Endura are two of the most popular and successful folding knives. They’re used across the board in nearly every occupation and around the world.
Either is a good pick for a character after 1990, the year they were introduced. They sport a modern look and come in many variations.
Like the Buck 110, they are default knives for writers. Unlike the Buck 110, the Delica and Endura would fare better in a fight. They’re not tactical knives per se, but neither would be the worst choice.
Top Fixed Blade Combat Knives
Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife
The Fairbairn-Sykes could also be abbreviated as the F-S. Just spell it out the first time you reference it. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: dagger (sharpened on both sides)
Blade length: 7 inches
Overall length: 111⁄2 inches
Year introduced: 1943
Great Britain scrambed to put a decent knife into the hands of its special operations units in World War II. After several attempts, the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife (also known as the British Commando Knife) made it to frontlines in 1943.
Several incarnations of this knife exist, but feel free to write it with a 7-inch blade. Military characters from the United Kingdom in the 1940s through today could carry this knife. It’s possible characters in other countries might use this knife, too, since it’s so popular. This knife proliferated across the globe in World War II, and people on all sides became familiar with it.
However, be careful about outfitting U.K. civilians in stories set in recent years with the Fairbairn-Sykes. Knife laws in that country severely restrict anything resembling a “fighting knife.”
Applegate-Fairbairn Fighting Knife
It’s tempting to write the Applegate-Fairbairn into stories set in World War II. Although the A-F can trace its lineage back to that era, it was actually introduced in 1980, according to BLADE magazine. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Type: dagger (blade sharpened on both sides)
Blade length: 6 inches
Overall length: 103⁄4 inches
Year introduced: 1980
Not to be outdone by their counterparts in Great Britain, the United States responded to the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife with the Applegate-Fairbairn Fighting Knife. It took only forty years to do it.
What’s the difference? Introduced in 1980, the Applegate-Fairbairn (also abbreviated as A-F) sports a more modern feel and updated materials. The late Col. Rex Applegate designed this knife specifically for hand-to-hand military combat. Applegate’s techniques and knives survive him.
Here’s why Googling this knife will lead writers astray. The A-F can trace its heritage back to World War II, when the first incarnations hit the frontlines. However, Applegate didn’t formally introduce the A-F until 1980.
That means the A-F only sort of existed in World War II. For the sake of accuracy, write the A-F in stories set in 1980 or later.
Feel free to assign the A-F to Western covert or military characters. The A-F is also available on civilian markets where laws allow (research the setting’s blade length laws and dagger restrictions).
Several A-F variations are available from different manufacturers, but a good go-to is the 6-inch blade model made by Boker. Gerber also makes automatic and assisted opening versions of this knife. Blade lengths with those vary from less than 3 inches to 41⁄2.
Benchmade Nimravus Cub II
Sure, this is a shameless endorsement of a product I happen to like. But the Benchmade Nimravus Cub II really is the perfect portable, do-it-all fixed blade knife. Give it to military, outdoors-y, law enforcement, civilian, and criminal characters. (Author's photo.)
Type: fixed blade
Blade length: 31⁄2 inches
Overall length: 722⁄25 inches
Introduced: mid-2000s
The “Nim Cub,” as it’s often called, doesn’t pack the history of the other knives on this list. It didn’t revolutionize combat knives. In fact, it’s pretty vanilla.
However, it ranks as my favorite fixed blade knife in the real world. It’s ergonomic, lightweight, portable, tough, and versatile. No hunting or outdoors trip of mine goes without the Nim Cub.
Benchmade designed this knife for use by airborne military units. The Nim Cub needed to do everything, from tactical to survival. It succeeded in spades. For fiction, this is a top choice for characters in and out of the military.
Cold Steel Tanto
The tanto in this Cold Steel Tanto refers to the roughly 45-degree angle at the tip. This makes it ideal for characters needing to plow through tough materials. (Photo courtesy of Cold Steel for BLADE.)
Type: fixed blade
Blade Length: 6, 71⁄2, 9, or 12 inches
Overall Length: 111⁄2, 131⁄8, 145⁄8, or 175⁄8 inches
Introduced: mid-1980s
The tanto term refers to the style at the tip of the blade, where the edge forms a hard angle to meet the point instead of the classic sweeping shape. Tantos are present on the Cold Steel Tanto, as well as many other knives.
This design strengthens the tip of the blade. Characters needing to hack through hard materials, even metal, should consider a Cold Steel Tanto.
Caveat: The character should be familiar with handling knives. The size of some of the models approaches that of a short sword. The version with the 6-inch blade is the most practical in all likelihood.
Of course, a writer surely could think of things to hack to pieces with the 12-incher.
Gerber Mark II
As a dagger, the Gerber Mark II is ideal for quick hit-and-run scenes. (Photo courtesy of Gerber.)
Type: dagger (blade is sharpened on both sides)
Blade length: 61⁄2 inches
Overall length: 123⁄4 inches
Year introduced: 1966
Need something to round out that cloak and dagger ensemble? Introduced in 1966, the Gerber Mark II is the ticket.
The U.S. military put the 1966 Mark II to use for the next forty years, so it’s a good choice for outfitting your characters. The Mark II is also available on the civilian market (where the law allows).
Like all daggers, the Mark II is best used for stabbing when writing fight scenes. The drawback is that in a struggle, there’s twice the number of ways for the character with the knife to cut himself, since the blade is sharpened on both sides.
KA-BAR USMC
Introduced in World War II, the KA-BAR USMC is still issued to U.S. Marines and members of other branches of the military. Pictured is an updated version using modern materials. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Type: fixed blade
Blade length: 7 inches
Overall length: 117⁄8 inches
Year introduced: 1942
Few knives are as iconic as KA-BAR’s USMC. The U.S. Marine Corps started using this fixed blade knife in late 1942 during World War II. Other services quickly adopted it.
This knife is tough as hell, versatile, easy to grip, and imitated by a number of companies. It’s appropriate to write this knife generically as a KA-BAR instead of KA-BAR USMC.
This is the perfect knife to outfit any U.S. military character up to present time in any conflict or setting. It’s also popular on the civilian market.
I place the KA-BAR as the number one pick for characters needing a knife for combat—even outside of the military. It’ll handle nearly anything, including a tour of duty through the pages of fiction.
Randall Model 1
The Randall Model 1, knife of the stars. It’s been used by everyone from the Army to astronauts. (Photo courtesy of Mike Silvey for BLADE.)
Type: fixed blade
Blade length: 5, 6, 7, or 8 inches
Overall length: approximately 113⁄4 inches, depending on blade length and style
Year introduced: 1941
World War II cranked out many more iconic knives than just the KA-BAR. The Randall Model 1 “All Purpose Fighter” debuted to incredible demand by U.S. troops. It’s since been used in every branch of service up through today, as well as “astronauts, government agents, celebrities, statesmen, and royalty,” according to information found at www.RandallKnives.com.
The Model 1 is not as well known to the general readership, but including it will make the writer look pretty sharp. Plus, the variety of blade lengths offers versatility when the story calls for it.
Top Survival Knives and Multi-Tools
Famar’s USA SRT Survival Knife
Famar’s USA SRT Survival Knife comes with everything but the plot. (Photo courtesy of Living Ready.)
Type: folding knife
Blade length: 31⁄2 inches
Length closed: 51⁄8 inches
Length open: 85⁄8 inches
Year introduced: 2013
For characters with more inner “Inspector Gadget” than “MacGyver,” there’s the Famar’s USA SRT Survival Knife.
The SRT comes with a built-in LED light, a fire-starting rod, a glass breaker (a stud on the bottom of the handle, called the pommel), and a razor belt cutter. Oh, and a half-serrated blade.
Will it keep a character on an adventure alive in a pinch? Yes. Does it pass scrutiny in real life? It depends. Either way, writers should feel free to use the SRT for the fiction its designers must have had in mind.
Leatherman
The Leatherman started as a glorified pair of pliers. It’s perfect for bringing out the MacGyver in any character. (Courtesy of Leatherman Tool Group for BLADE.)
Type: multi-tool
Length: varies
Year introduced: 1983
has various blades and accessory tools
The original Leatherman multi-tool came to the market in 1983. It’s now become a generic term for a pliers platform with knives and other tools folded inside, and it’s acceptable to write it that way.
If a character needs a multi-tool prior to 1983, write in a Swiss army knife.
SOG Trident Tanto TF-7
Why would a knife need a built-in seat-belt cutter? In an emergency, a character could cut straps or other material without unfolding the blade first. The seat-belt cutter is located in the notch near the end of the handle on this SOG Trident. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: assisted opening knife
Blade length: 33⁄4 inches
Length closed: 43⁄4 inches
Length open: 81⁄2 inches
The Trident would be categorized as yet another assisted opening tactical knife, except for one important difference: There’s a seat-belt cutter in the handle.
It may seem redundant to include a separate seat-belt cutter in a knife, but this small slot with a blade inside makes it much easier to cut a seat belt after a wreck. The knife doesn’t need to be open.
This isn’t a feature exclusive to the Trident. It’s just that this is a great example of a knife with a belt cutter. This knife is perfect for first-responders (EMT, firefighter, police officer) or simply well-prepared characters.
Spyderco Assist
Knife handles don’t always have to be black. The highly visible blaze orange on this Spyderco Assist complements its intended purpose. It’s an off-the-beaten-path choice for characters in maritime or emergency scenarios. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: Folding knife
Blade length: 37⁄10 inches
Length closed: 47⁄8 inches
Length open: 83⁄8 inches
Introduced: around 2008
Several features of this knife make it ideal for a first-responder or marine-centric character.
The Spyderco Assist lacks a tip, which allows for close work next to skin or other sensitive materials. Think freeing someone from a wrecked car. Small serrations along the blade come in handy for this purpose, too.
Rounding out the knife is a wavy pattern along the handle, a feature that assists in cutting rope. The rope is placed inside one of the indentations in the handle before the blade is folded down and closed on top of it. This action cuts the rope cleanly without having to saw away at it.
Victorinox/Wenger Swiss Army Knives
A Victorinox Swiss Army Knife is great for getting characters in and out of trouble. (Photo courtesy of Victorinox for BLADE.)
Type: multi-tool
Length: varies
Introduced: 1880s
tools vary
A certain irony coincides with the fact that a country known for neutrality is also the home of one of the most famous “army knives” in existence. Swiss army knives hit the scene in the 1880s and are now found across the globe.
While there are scores of imitators, those made by Victorinox and Wenger are the granddaddies of them all. While it’s acceptable to write Swiss army knife generically, mention either brand to amp up a manuscript’s authenticity.
What’s the difference between the two brands? Not much. Both played a part in introducing the knife to the Swiss army in the 1880s. Both are located in Switzerland. The only difference is Wenger came from a French-speaking area, while Victorinox hailed from a German-speaking area. The Swiss government bought from both companies to supply its military.
Top Machetes
Cold Steel Bowie Machete
For a size comparison, the Cold Steel Bowie Machete (second from bottom) is pictured next to full-sized machetes. Note how the Bowie Machete sports a more compact design. It straddles the line between a standard fixed blade knife and a machete. This middle ground can come in handy when a scene needs an exceptionally beefy blade but a machete doesn’t make sense. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Blade length: 12 inches
Overall length: 175⁄8 inches
The large size of a machete makes it difficult to control. For something more practical, go with the Cold Steel Bowie Machete. It takes the tried-and-true design of a classic Bowie knife and adds a few inches.
This is as small as machetes get without becoming regular fixed blade knives. Give it to a character with a flair for style while hacking things to pieces.
As far as a year of introduction for this specific model, the earliest I could confirm was 2013.
Cold Steel Two-Handed Katana Machete
Sometimes, a mere machete just won’t do. This Cold Steel Two-Handed Katana Machete can pull triple duty as a machete, sword, and throwing spear. I couldn’t mention this little number without directing you to an equally over-the-top, tragicomic video demonstration. Don’t view before eating. tinyurl.com/katana-machete (Photo courtesy of Cold Steel.)
Blade length: 24 inches
Overall length: 401⁄2 inches
Here’s an over-the-top twist on any standard machete. The Cold Steel Two-Handed Katana Machete’s handle takes up almost half of its overall length. Why? It’s meant to be thrown.
That’s right. It’s a machete the length of a sword designed to be thrown like a spear. Two hands are recommended—for safety, of course.
The Katana Machete can be used for standard slashing and hacking, too. But the fact it’s designed for throwing may prove too tempting for fiction.
The earliest I could confirm this machete was available was 2010.
Condor Tool & Knife El Salvador
The El Salvador machete sports a classic design. It’s an easy choice for characters slashing through brush, zombies, or whatever else is in the way. (Photo courtesy of Condor Tool & Knife.)
Blade length: 18 inches
Overall length: 231⁄2 inches
Year introduced: 2004
For a machete with a classic look, the Condor Tool & Knife El Salvador is the ticket. It’s the perfect first choice when outfitting a character from 2004 onward. It’s inexpensive—around $75.
Remember that it’s perfectly acceptable to write machete generically. But if you need the name of a classic-looking machete, the El Salvador is it.
Gerber Gator Sawback
Other than the teeth along the spine of this machete, the Gator’s other advantage is its ubiquity. It’s a staple at sporting goods stores across the U.S., increasing the chances your character might own it. (Photo courtesy of Gerber Gear.)
Blade length: 18 inches
Overall length: 257⁄10 inches
Introduced: early 1990s
For a sadistic twist, outfit a character with the Gerber Gator Sawback. It sports a saw along the spine of the knife. Controlling the saw teeth is a challenge, since pressing down on the sharpened edged on the opposite side of the blade will guarantee a gaping hand wound.
Then again, maybe a slow, clumsy saw is just what the scene ordered.
TOPS Knives Armageddon
Designers had tactical uses in mind when crafting the Armageddon machete (top) instead of utilitarian outdoors work. It could be dropped into any setting, though. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Blade length: 105⁄8 inches
Overall length: 161⁄2 inches
Most machetes aren’t designed for combat, but this is the exception. The TOPS Knives Armageddon is considered a tactical machete, and it’s ideal for characters who are expecting trouble.
The key difference lies in the thickness of the blade. Most machetes use thinner blades compared to knives. The Armageddon uses a quarter-inch-thick blade. This allows it to handle tougher cutting jobs like a knife while maintaining the oversized utility of a machete.
The earliest I could confirm the Armageddon’s existence was 2006.
Top Boot Knives
A.G. Russell Sting Boot Knife
Since the mid-1970s, the Sting set the standard for boot knives. Writers would do well to slide it into a character’s boot as a backup knife. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: dagger (blade is sharpened on both sides)
Blade length: 31⁄8 inches
Overall length: 67⁄8 inches
Year introduced: 1975
The AG Russell Sting is one of the most popular boot knives on the market. It’s perfect for slipping inside a sheath in a boot, or for everyday tasks that don’t involve concealment. The Sting is a tough little number ready for a character’s last-ditch defense.
Like all boot knives, the Sting isn’t necessarily carried in the boot. A boot knife refers more to a style than a specific function. The Sting could be used like any other knife.
Columbia River Knife & Tool (CRKT) manufactures the Sting today.
Gerber Guardian
For a boot knife that also functions well as a classic dagger, write in the Gerber Guardian. (Photo courtesy of www.KnifeForums.com.)
Type: dagger (blade is sharpened on both sides)
Blade length: 32⁄5 inches
Overall length: 71⁄3 inches

The Gerber Guardian ranks up there with the Sting as a popular boot knife. The two knives are quite similar, although the Guardian sports a more classic dagger design.
When a character needs a boot knife, use either the Sting or the Guardian. Both are no-fail picks.
Top Butterfly Knives
Benchmade 42 Bali-Song/Bali-Song, Inc. Wee Hawk
For fiction, the variations of butterfly knives, such as this Benchmade 42, don’t matter so much. The laws do, though. Be sure to check them if it’s important to the setting. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Blade length: 41⁄5 inches
Closed length: 51⁄5 inches
Open length: 92⁄5 inches
Introduced: late 1970s
The go-to butterfly knife for fiction is the Bali-Song, Inc. Wee Hawk. It was first introduced in the late 1970s and ended production in the late 1990s, but many remain in circulation.
The design proved incredibly popular and is still considered by many to be the ultimate butterfly knife. It lived on as the Benchmade 42 Bali-Song (write it as Benchmade 42), produced from the early 2000s to 2010. Keep those brand names—Benchmade and Bali-Song, Inc.—in mind if such things matter to the year the story takes place. Also consider applicable laws for the setting, because this knife is often restricted.
Other Butterfly Knives
The Bradley Cutlery Kimura series, models from Bear & Son Cutlery, and standards like the Spyderco SpyderFly could all have their own separate entries—but they’re not getting them. Why not?
Here’s the thing. When writing fiction, butterfly knives don’t need to vary too much. They’re used for intimidation and light cutting jobs. That’s about it. The differences between the go-to Benchmade 42 and these others begin to dissolve because of that narrow usage.
As a shortcut, remember it’s acceptable to use butterfly knife or balisong generically. Bali-Song is a registered trademark of Benchmade. That hyphen makes a difference.
