A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
Gender may be an issue with this lesson because a lot of things are considered unacceptable for women to do. If a woman’s purpose in life is to do something society believes is unacceptable, you have a character in direct conflict with society rules. Think of Chopin’s Story of an Hour. When the main character hears that her husband is dead, she is upset but then begins to see how much freedom she now has to pursue her interests as a widow she can do more and does not have to get married again. She feels unimaginable joy, until the surprise ending.
A twist can also play in culture and geography. Remember the bobsled racers from Jamaica? Where are they going to practice? The geography of their home proved to be a problem, but they still listened to their calling and did whatever they had to do to learn their craft so they could compete in the Olympics. It wasn’t until they developed their own style that they became successful. They had to give up trying to be like everyone else.
