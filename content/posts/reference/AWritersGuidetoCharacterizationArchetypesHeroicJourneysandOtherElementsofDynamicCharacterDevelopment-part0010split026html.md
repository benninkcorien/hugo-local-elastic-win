A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and the AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. She can help him with this but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. As long as he can have his alone time he doesn’t care where she is guided. As an asset he can help her find safety as she carries out her mission. He may feel a sense of pride in her and her missions.
He can be a drawback if he refuses to take her seriously or believe in her. He can disappear and cause a lot of trouble for her.
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. On the other hand the Recluse needs a steady home base to build his sanctuary. He can be a very faithful husband and set up a home base for her to come back to when she needs it. He doesn’t mind living alone for long periods of time at all and she may be gone often.
If he doesn’t get sucked into her mission, he will likely leave her and the entire situation. He can easily walk away from others.
