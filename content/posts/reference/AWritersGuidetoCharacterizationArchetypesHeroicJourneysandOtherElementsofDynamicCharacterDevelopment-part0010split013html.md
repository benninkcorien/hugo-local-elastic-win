A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE AMAZON
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. This is not something the Amazon would put up with for long. She will not allow any man to talk to her in a harsh way. She wants to find a place of her own, and she wants to be recognized for her contributions. The Protector will value what she does because he’s just like her, but that’s also the problem—they are too much alike.
The Amazon doesn’t want to be protected or saved; she wants to do that herself. The Protector wants to protect her and gets frustrated when she won’t let him do his job. If she messes up even in the slightest, he will point it out to her with an ‘I told you so’ attitude.
He may not know how to act around the Amazon because he’s used to having to protect most other people. When she accomplishes something he has done, he feels like he should do something bigger, better, and this attitude sets them off on a competitive tangent.
She has a hard time understanding why he feels the need to protect her, and she wonders why he doesn’t see that she can care for herself. Maybe she needs to learn to work with others or accept their help?
