A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER AND THE MAIDEN
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Father’s Daughter cannot understand a woman who can’t or won’t take care of herself. She may have had a difficult childhood, and when she’s around the Maiden she is reminded of that time.
The Maiden can’t understand a woman who would choose to be so strong, mental, serious, and responsible all of the time.
The Maiden can teach the Father’s Daughter that it’s healthy and enriching to let go and play once in a while, that life can be fun and enjoyable.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Maiden the value of a good education and how to plan for the future.
