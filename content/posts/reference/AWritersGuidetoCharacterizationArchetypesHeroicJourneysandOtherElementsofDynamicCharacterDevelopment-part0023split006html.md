A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
A tragic resolution occurs when the hero continues to sabotage himself and misses out on developing meaningful relationships in his life. He’s not strong enough to risk vulnerability. He probably doesn’t think he could survive a letdown. Something from his past still has a hold on him, and he can’t find a way to heal and move on.
As the all-American hero, he would not acknowledge his shortcomings, which could manifest in his ability to inspire and motivate others to help him. The shortcoming need not be physical. It might be that he is not able to acknowledge whatever issue is keeping him off his game, and it winds up taking down the entire project or goal.
