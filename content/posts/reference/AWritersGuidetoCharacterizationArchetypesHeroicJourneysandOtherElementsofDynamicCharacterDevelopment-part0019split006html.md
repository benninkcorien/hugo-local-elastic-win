A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
An unsuccessful resolution occurs when the hero’s idea doesn’t work, or when he hesitates to act and somebody else comes to the rescue with a very similar idea and the rescuer reaps all the benefits and rewards. (An example is the competition between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to create the first computer.) Or the hero fails to attempt his idea, and as a result a huge disaster occurs that could have been averted. As a consequence, the hero has to deal with a lot of guilt and shame. He wonders why he didn’t believe in himself. A lot of internal agony may be associated with this lesson.
