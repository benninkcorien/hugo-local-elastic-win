A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
MENTAL VS. MENTAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to feel vulnerable to change, and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. The Father’s Daughter will never make him feel vulnerable, but she is used to being around powerful men.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. The King can’t help her with any of this. He likes women who are in control and mentally focused. The Father’s Daughter is like this.
They are very comfortable around each other and can be business partners. He can work with women who show they know what they are doing. The Father’s Daughter has much experience working with men.
She’s attracted to powerful men, which the King is, plus he is as mentally focused as she is. The problem for this pairing comes when he wants to settle down and build a home and family—his kingdom. She wants to continue working. Her career is number one in her life, not kids. She usually won’t give into his demands and if she does it may hurt her in the long run.
She likes being the only female in the group, and feels she is the ‘exceptional woman.’ “The King may not be able to work with other women but I’m different,” she tells herself. She expects him to give her respect and to see her as an asset.
