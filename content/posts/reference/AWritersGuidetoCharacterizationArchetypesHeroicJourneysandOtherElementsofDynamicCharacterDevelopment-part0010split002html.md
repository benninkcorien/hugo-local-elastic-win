A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
King Henry VIII to Lady Anne Boleyn:
“…No more to you at this present, mine own darling, for lack of time.
But I would that you were in my arms, or I in yours for I think it long since I kissed you.
Written after the killing of a heart, at eleven of the clock; purposing with God’s grace, tomorrow, mighty timely, to kill another, by the hand which, I trust, shortly shall be yours. HENRY R.”
