A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Romantic Themes:
INDEPENDENCE: Desire for someone different than the people you have previously dated or desire for someone completely different from you. Wanting a life change and needing someone who is where you may want to go.
LOVE VS. HONOR: What you want to do versus what you should do. Considering others’ needs and your duty to your family. There is a major obstacle in your relationship and you have to learn to value your own needs. This fits well with paranormal stories as the hero is usually otherworldly and ‘normal’ people and family members may not accept him.
BEAUTY ARCHETYPES: Seductive Muse, Amazon, Matriarch
BEAST ARCHETYPES: Recluse, King, Protector, Artist
Variations on this story include Ugly and the Beast by Barbara Walker and Tale of the Rose by Emma Donoghue.
