A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE ARTIST
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Fool and the Artist can potentially be two peas in a pod. The Fool loves to live outside of what is considered a ‘normal’ lifestyle, and the Artist is always available during the daytime.
The Fool possesses a natural gift for bringing joy to others. Simply being around the Fool makes the Artist feel young again. The Fool supports the Artist’s view of life and validates his choices.
The Artist can teach the Fool to respect the arts. The Fool can share his views with the Artist, without worrying about being condemned.
