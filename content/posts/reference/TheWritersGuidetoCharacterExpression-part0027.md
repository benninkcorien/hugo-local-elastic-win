SHALLOW: DOUBT
SHALLOW: DOUBT
Quote: “These emotions—fear, pain, doubt—are part of the human condition. If your hero is impervious to them, it is harder to understand them and harder to imagine ourselves as them.” —author, Tristan Gregory
If you write mysteries, thrillers, or suspense, then this chapter should help you strengthen your storyline with a Deeper POV. Having a suspicious character(s) is a useful trope in almost any drama, even if that shady character turns out to be innocent.
Suspicion or doubt can take on many forms, like the unreliable narrator, and these traits can be another way to add a deeper layer of characterization to any fiction novel.
In order to realistically explain any suspicious characters, I would use a traumatic event from the characters’ past, or something that happens plot-wise to arouse your character’s suspicion. (But be careful of it not becoming a sense of paranoia.)
Suspicion and doubt can also make a great “fatal flaw” for your character to overcome by the end of the story.
Doubt is closely tied with suspicion, but it can also be used to create unanswered questions about secondary characters or mysterious events throughout the storyline. It can also be used subtly throughout a narrative to build-up suspense.
Signs of doubt or suspicion might be:
Narrowed eyes
Brows drawing together
One eyebrow lifted
Squinty eyes
Long, hard stare
Throat clearing
Puckered lips
Nodding head
Folding arms
Stiff posture
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I was doubtful that Shawn was telling me the truth.
DEEP POV: With narrowed eyes, I stared at Shawn. “Is that true?” I demanded.
SHALLOW: He felt doubtful about going on the vacation.
DEEP POV: He checked his bank statement, but the small number meant he probably couldn’t go on the vacation.
SHALLOW: I did not believe Alex because he was a two-faced liar.
DEEP POV: My brows drew together and I sighed. “How can I trust anything you say?”
SHALLOW: I did not trust him and he was acting suspicious.
DEEP POV: I squinted at him and tilted my head to the side. “You’re not fooling me.”
SHALLOW: Maggie listened to Glenn’s story with a shadow of doubt. (cliché)
DEEP POV: Maggie nodded her head while Glenn talked, but her gut instinct told her to be wary.
SHALLOW: I saw a strange, suspicious man outside.
DEEP POV: My posture stiffened when I glimpsed a strange man lurking outside.
SHALLOW: As a cop, Malcom didn’t believe one word the suspect said.
DEEP POV: Malcom rolled his eyes heavenward and fingered the silver badge fastened to his belt.

Here is a condensed scene taken from my paranormal romance novel, UNDER SUNLESS SKIES, which depicts the feelings of doubt and suspicion in the main character. She is being blackmailed and everyone seems like a suspect.
Please carefully examine this scene…
DEEP POV:
When I stop at my locker before third period, Tanisha Jackson, one of my good friends and fellow lovers of dark-side apparel, rushes up to me in the corridor.
“Hey! I’m glad I caught you,” she says breathlessly.
“What’s up?” I ask, opening the locker.
Lowering my sunglasses, I check my teeth for lipstick stains in the mirror, rubbing one finger over a red smudge on my front tooth. As I lean back, a black envelope flutters out of the locker, and I barely manage to catch it before it hits the ground.
“Can I borrow your notes for trig tomorrow?” Tanisha briefly touches my shoulder, and I glance at her. “I’m leaving early for a dentist appointment.”
“Um, yeah, I guess…” I say distractedly.
“I don’t even want to go because the last time I had an appointment,” she says, “it was so annoying when the dental assistant asked me to remove my tongue ring…”
While Tanisha is talking, I rip open the envelope and pull out a white slip of paper with the typed words:
I KNOW YOUR SECRETS. TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS NOTE, AND THEY BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE!
My hands shake as I scan the note, and then I reread it because I can’t quite believe what I’m seeing. My chest tightens painfully. I just learned the truth about my parents and I’m still dealing with the big reveal of my heritage, along with the breakup, and now someone is blackmailing me.
I am so screwed. This is like a bad slasher movie. Some twisted version of I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer. I clutch the warning message to my chest so Tanisha won’t see it. Not that she’s even paying attention because she is still rambling about going to the dentist.
“...then when I do it,” Tanisha continues, flipping her dreadlocks over one shoulder. “The dentist claims he lost the barbell during my teeth cleaning. But I think my mom put him up to it. So can I borrow them tomorrow?”
Images flash through my mind like an erratic slideshow, displaying everything bad that’ll happen if my secrets are revealed, like Sector Thirteen soldiers storming my house, and next comes the painful ice pick lobotomy, followed by my dad being sent to prison. My family will be ripped apart…
“Sloane?” Tanisha touches my shoulder. “Are you okay? You look like you’re gonna spew chunks.”
“Huh? Yeah, I’m good.” I thrust the note into a pocket of my backpack and zip it tight.
Tanisha stares at me. “So can I or not?”
For the life of me, I can’t remember what she wanted.
 Oh, right—math class. And something about notes.
If someone at school knows my dark secret, taking notes in trig will be the least of my worries.
But I can’t very well lose my mind in the hallway, so I force a stiff-lipped smile. “Uh-huh. I’ll give you the notes tomorrow.”
“Thanks! I gotta take off now. See you later.”
Once Tanisha walks away, I inspect the corridor. My mouth goes dry. Whoever left me this warning might be skulking nearby, watching my reaction. My squinty gaze flits over each student lingering in the corridor, searching their expressions for any signs of guilt.
Emma Fowler and Kaitlyn Carter are gossiping at their lockers, and when they catch me staring, my frenemies glare. The culprit could be Emma. My friend Raymond McGregor walks by with a classic chin jerk to say hello, but he doesn’t stop. A pack of giggling freshmen amble by, giving me a weird look. Hayden’s younger brother, Zach Lancaster, stands at the other end of the hall, talking with one of his basketball teammates with his back to me.
Yet it suddenly seems as if the entire population of Haven High knows the truth….

Deep POV can make the story more interactive and intimate. Showing allows readers to experience differing emotions or visit exotic places. And a reader who feels like they’re connected and really experiencing the story, is a reader who won’t be able to put the book down.
