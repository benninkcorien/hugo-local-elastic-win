A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
ROMANCE WRITERS
Some of you may be writing romance novels and wondering how the masculine and feminine journeys I presented in 45 Master Characters (or the Joseph Campbell model) fit with the romantic journeys. Well, if you want to write a great romance, you should start with a traditional journey model as the plan for your main plot and use the romantic journeys as a plan for the subplot. This doesn’t mean the romance will take a backseat to the main story. Romances are supposed to be about romance after all.
The main story becomes the spine on which the relationship is developed. Remember the traditional journeys are very suitable to character-driven stories where the hero will face many obstacles to her goal and have to face hardships. The elements of the romantic journeys become the hardships. You can create an adventure plot and weave the romantic subplot into it.
Think of it this way: Most of Barbara Cartland’s romance novels (which have collectively sold over a billion copies) are similar to the Cinderella romance model—the pretty, quiet, innocent girl meets the handsome, powerful, older man who is usually a cynic. He falls in love with her and molds her into a beautiful princess, teaching her the art of love by the end of the story.
At the same time, though, most of Cartland’s novels take place in exotic places and feature heroes who explore exotic lands, intent on saving the world. She purposely ‘added a touch of James Bond’ as she put it, to all her stories.
