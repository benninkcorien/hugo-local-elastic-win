A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: THE HEROINE HOLDS THE POWER.
“Independence” and “Love vs. Honor”
In Beauty and the Beast, the heroine saves the hero.
   •  Beauty asks her father for a rose when he goes out of town.
   •  Her father gets stuck in a storm and finds shelter in a strange castle.
   •  When he leaves, he picks a rose and the Beast comes out to yell at him and demands his life in payment.
   •  The Beast agrees to take Beauty as payment instead.
   •  Beauty agrees to live with the Beast to save her father.
   •  Beauty and the Beast become friends, but Beauty can’t agree to marry him.
   •  Beast allows Beauty to go home to visit her sick father if she agrees to return in seven days.
   •  She forgets to return and the Beast gets sick without her. Beauty rushes back to his side to pronounce her love for him.
   •  The Beast is saved by her love and turned into a handsome prince.
The focus on this story is on the heroine and how she feels. She has to fall in love with the hero of her own free will. He cannot force himself upon her. He doesn’t live in the normal world and can’t make any claims upon her. Society’s rules do not apply to him.
The Beast demands her in payment regardless of how she looks or who she is, sight unseen. He is not looking for the best woman in all the land but any woman who can truly love him for who he is.
Power, tension, and violence set the tone in this gothic-style story. The Beast is like a child and Beauty holds the power to save him. She is the light to his darkness. She changes his life for the better in the end and he feels unworthy of her.
This story focuses on the heroine falling in love with the hero, since he is already in love with her from the start.
