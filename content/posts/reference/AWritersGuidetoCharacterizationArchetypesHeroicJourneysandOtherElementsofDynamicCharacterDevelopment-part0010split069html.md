A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
EXERCISE:
Write love letters between your hero and heroine when they first meet. Who would write the first letter? Who is the pursuer? Who is able to express their feelings? How does the heroine perceive what the hero has written, and vice versa?
Now write love letters that take place after the couple has shared an intimate moment. Then write one that takes place after the story is over.
If you prefer, you can write a love letter from one of your characters to another character who isn’t in your story. The hero can be in love with a woman who has passed away, for example, and the letter can be to her.
Paint a very vivid picture of how your characters feel, even if they would never give this letter to their loved one.
Show their sense of loneliness, loss, anticipation, or awe. If you speak from your heart and not your head you can write such letters yourself and use them to inspire your novel writing.
If you are an action writer and this is hard for you, think of Lethal Weapon and how Mel Gibson told the story of his wife’s death to his partner.
   •  Try not to be obvious with your words.
   •  Paint a picture of how the character feels using metaphors. Think about using all the senses: sight, smell, taste, hearing, and feeling.
   •  Take a walk in a natural setting or listen to music to get in the mood and into the character’s feelings.
   •  What would your character say if no one was going to read the letter?
Now read the letters and see what this tells you about your characters. If your character is reluctant to talk, consider why this is so. If your character blabs on and on about herself, consider why this is so.
Did you find another layer of subtext to add to their backstories? Use these letters later on to develop your love scenes.
