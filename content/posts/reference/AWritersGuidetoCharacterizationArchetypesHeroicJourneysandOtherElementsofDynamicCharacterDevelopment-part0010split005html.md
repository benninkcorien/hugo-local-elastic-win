A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE AMAZON
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, and if they are doing physical activities—hang gliding and bungee jumping can really loosen him up—the Amazon can help him with that. She wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The Businessman may not value the same things she does.
The Businessman may not know how to act around the Amazon. She may be tougher than he is and this may make him feel like less of a man. In turn, he may be short with her and uncooperative. He may use his brains to make her feel stupid. Or he may like the dominatrix type and seek her out.
She has a hard time understanding all the intellectual jargon he uses, and she wonders if he is trying to impress her or make her feel stupid. He can be a good balance for her if he’s assertive, but if he’s not, they will have a tough time making things work.
