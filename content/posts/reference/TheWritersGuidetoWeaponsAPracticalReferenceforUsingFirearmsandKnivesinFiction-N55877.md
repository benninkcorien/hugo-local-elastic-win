How to Kill a Character with a Knife, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
How to Kill a Character with a Knife
Dissecting Knife Violence: The Three Purposes
Knife fights are a brutal business in both fiction and reality. The personal nature of the violence almost requires a reversion to primitive instincts. Maybe that’s why stories of attacks with edged weapons have been around since storytelling itself.
However, knife fight might not be the best term to describe the situation. Fight involving knives may be the better way to put it. Unlike firearms, knives don’t define the fight. Knives are accessories to a scene. They’re in the picture, but they aren’t the frame.
That’s because a prolonged fight involving only knives is unlikely in the real world. As an online editor for BLADE, I attended several knife-fighting demonstrations at various events. These choreographed martial arts demonstrations involved two combatants, each with a knife. While these performances were certainly interesting and required great talent to master, they had more in common with dancing than they did with fighting.
Sure, a character can break out some gratuitous mall ninja knife moves that would make the ghost of Bruce Lee proud. But for violent knife depictions grounded in reality, there really are only three practical applications:
attacking another character using the element of surprise
a last resort for self-defense
mutilating or intimidating another character who cannot fight back
Pick up a newspaper and flip to the crime section. The majority of knife violence, unfortunately, will fall into those three categories. Note the circumstances that led to the violence, then work backward to determine how the type of knife influenced the outcome. It’s surprising how well this can inform a scene, though it’s a bit morbid.
Fiction isn’t journalism, but recognizing the nature of this violence is key to understanding the knives themselves. Some knives are better than others for carrying out brutal tasks.
Think Quick, Knives Are Fast Fighters
When writing a fight, think of knives as racecars careening through a scene at 200 mph. They’re fast. In the time line of the story, they should cross their finish line faster than a football captain on prom night. There are four reasons for this.
First, as stated in the section on knife laws, using a knife in a violent encounter—even if it’s for self-defense—treads some gray legal grounds. If a character intends to stay on the right side of Johnny Law, a prolonged knifing just isn’t going to look good in the courts of law or public opinion.
Second, a struggle involving a knife dramatically increases the risk of a self-inflicted injury. Blades don’t come with an off switch. They cut anything they touch. The shorter the encounter, the better the odds that the character with the knife will make it out unscathed.
Creative license can influence those odds. Michael Myers managed to murder scores of victims in the Halloween movies without accidentally cutting himself. Thrillers and crime fiction are certainly allowed to take the same liberties. But in the real world, people have difficulty slicing bagels without injuring themselves. My father chopped all but a shred of a finger off while butchering a chicken. And unlike a character in fiction, the headless, plucked chicken wasn’t fighting back.
Third, there’s going to blood. For some reason, thrillers and crime fiction overlook this fact all the time—it’s as if blood disappears into the ether after a cut. The character using the knife is going to get messy. Maybe that matters to the story, maybe it doesn’t. But the blood has to go somewhere.
Fourth, even if none of the three other points matter, knife fights are physically taxing. Get out of that chair and run in place for a solid minute. It’s exhausting, right? Now imagine doing that with a knife while another person tries to kill you.
Granted, characters might be in better shape than the average writer (not you, though; I mean those other writers). It’s still worthwhile to have a perspective on the physical toll anything beyond a quick knife encounter will take.
Know the Three Ways to Injure
There are essentially three ways to inflict injury using a knife.
Stabbing: The knife is thrust into a target.
Slashing and cutting: The knife is in motion as a laceration is made along the edge of the blade.
Chopping and hacking: The knife’s edge is pushed deeper into a target.
These definitions might seem obvious, but things get fuzzy when knives are part of the action in a scene. Is the particular knife suited to stabbing, slashing, chopping, or some combination of the three? Keep it consistent.
A kitchen cleaver is ideal for hacking a hunk of meat off a character, but it’s not designed for stabbing. It’s a metal square. There’s no tip.
A generic folding knife might take care of stabbing plus slashing, but not chopping or hacking.
A straight razor will slash an ear clean off. It might be up for limited stabbing action, but straight razors lack a tip. Chopping or hacking is off-limits, since straight razors are on the flimsy end of the knife spectrum.
The idea is to keep injury routes consistent with the knife design.
A less-common way to injure with a knife is by sawing, which for the purposes of this guide is considered a type of hacking. Striking a character with an unsharpened component of the knife, such as the bottom of the handle (pommel), is another way to inflict harm.
Knife Combat Essentials
Four essential scenes make up the bulk of knife violence in fiction. These are similar to the three purposes outlined previously but focus more on the what than the why.
grappling
mutilation
self-defense
surprise attack
In all situations, remember the 21-foot rule of thumb. As determined by the Tueller Drill (a law enforcement drill), an attacker with a knife 21 feet or less away can inflict a lethal injury before the defender can draw, aim, and fire a gun. This may help to explain news reports of police officers shooting people with edged or blunt weapons to death. Consider the 21-foot rule when writing fiction, too. It applies to both the attacker and the defender.
Grappling
Intense struggles involving knives are so profoundly brutal in the intimacy of their violence that they leave little wiggle room between life and death. In the same way no one can be a little bit pregnant, a knife fight is an all-in proposition, a commitment to seeing through to the death of an opponent who is only an eyelash’s distance away.
These struggles make for great fiction for that reason, but many depictions leave out one critical element: The character with the knife is probably going to get cut—maybe even worse than the one under attack. For whatever reason, fiction awards injuries only when they’re convenient. That’s fine, but I’d make the case that everyone in the struggle is going to get cut at some point.
Regardless, I suggest six routes to take as characters grapple with knives:
One character gains a physical advantage and uses the knife to injure the other.
The character without the knife gains a physical advantage and/or control of the knife, then injures the other.
The character without the knife manages to escape.
The character with the knife manages to escape.
Both characters succumb to injuries.
Both characters come to the conclusion that knife fights are crazy. They shake hands and get lunch.
Okay, that last one is unrealistic. A little humor never hurts.
The meat of the scene will be how these ends are achieved. How is the physical advantage obtained? Does the knife change hands? Toss in some dramatic descriptions, and it’s a knife fight.
Just remember that during that struggle, the blade will change its orientation many times, and the edge will lacerate whatever it touches.
Also keep in mind the injuries inflicted on the periphery of the violence. Decisive cuts, slashes, and chops are worth words. So are the fingers sliced off as the defender shields his face, the arms gouged as the character slouches into the fetal position, and the cuts made in hesitation before plunging the blade deeper.
Mutilation
When the character with the knife has total dominance or control over the other, it’s no longer a fight. It’s mutilation.
Serial killers in fiction are most often involved with this category of knife violence. So are torturers of immobilized characters.
This is still a type of combat; it’s just one-sided. The only sage advice for writing this scenario is to make sure the type of knife you choose is up for the task.
Self-Defense
As explained in the section about knife laws, self-defense is a difficult proposition when it comes to knives. At best, the knife will be used to inflict an injury that allows a hasty escape when no other means are possible. Hanging around to inflict further injuries when retreat is possible won’t look good in court, given the disparity of force would tip in the defender’s favor.
That doesn’t mean self-defense knife scenes have to be tame. Even a quick knife jab can be forged in fear.
Surprise Attack
Depending on the scenario, a surprise attack is arguably the best way to off a character while using a knife. It removes much of the risk of the attacker becoming injured with her blade during the encounter. For the writer, it can also be a lot of fun to set up.
There are a few classic surprise knife attacks that form the template for the technique.
One of the most widely used in fiction is the quick cut to the throat from behind. This is effective for obvious reasons, but there’s a caveat. It may take two hands: one to pull the head back to expose the throat and one to work the knife. Remember that the attacking character likely cannot see the victim’s throat. If the victim is looking downward, the knife might catch the chin instead of the throat.
Another standard is the hidden assailant cutting the Achilles tendon at ground level. Writers often put the attacker under a vehicle to catch someone walking nearby.
The aerial knife attack is also common. The classic aerial attack usually involves a concealed character tossing a knife or other edged object into the chest of a target victim. In scenes such as these, remember that, like bullets, these blades are not freight trains. They don’t hurl the victim backward upon impact. They make contact, that’s it. The victim might stagger, sure, but the knife wouldn’t launch him 30 feet. The impact from such a hit also wouldn’t stop a running victim in his tracks. In my opinion, the aerial attack is overused without merit in stories, but, hey, it’s fiction. (See the discussion of throwing knives in the Knives 101 section for more.)
One surprise attack comes from old military manuals: The kidney stab is perfect for scenes requiring stealth. The attacking character sneaks up from behind, places a hand over the mouth, stabs the kidneys in the lower back, and holds the victim silently in place. The victim dies quietly from blood loss.
No matter how the surprise attack is written, consider what happens immediately after the cut. Human beings, like any other creature, have a will to survive. Drawing their blood doesn’t turn them into helpless mannequins. That blood doesn’t magically evaporate, either. Ask yourself: Is there a struggle following the attack? Does the attacker get soaked in blood, and does that affect the story? Does the victim make noises during and after the attack? Consider the variables.
Where to Use a Knife on a Character: Kill-’Em-Quick Hot Spots
When having a character inflict a knife injury, consider some vulnerable hot spots that will put enough blood on the floor to render the victim unconscious or dead in minutes. I won’t go too deeply into the anatomical reasoning here, but you might want to consider consulting an anatomy textbook when slicing and dicing your characters to pieces, just so you know what is where.
An additional note: For maximum damage, have the character further twist or gouge these areas with the knife after making a puncture. This will open up the wound further and allow more blood to spill out.
Throat and Neck
These areas house the jugular veins and carotid arteries. Along with the carotid artery, there are three pairs of jugular veins: external, internal, and anterior. They all share a common intersection in the neck as they pump blood to and return blood from the head and the heart. A solid knife strike to the side and front of the neck and just under the jawline will likely sever one of these vital veins.
In fiction, a prominent misconception about jugular veins is that they spew blood. The high-pressure carotid artery, not the internal jugular veins, actually paints the ceiling with blood. When athletes and first responders feel for a pulse in the neck, they are feeling for the carotid artery. The internal jugular vein is right next to it. Although both are probably severed with the same cut, be sure to use the right term for which is spewing the blood—the carotid artery.
“Talk about a pain in the neck,” Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective, says.
On that note, also beware of terrible puns when writing these throat injuries.
Upper Inner Thigh
This is where you will find the femoral arteries, which deliver fresh blood into the legs before tucking behind the knees and branching off. A cut (or shot) to a character’s inner thigh near the groin down to just above knees is going to paint the scene red. There’s a reason the area from the inner thighs up to the groin is called the “Triangle of Death,” as explained in the section on knife safety.
“Will my jorts stop a cut in the Triangle of Death?” Maynard asks.
Probably not, Maynard. The femoral arteries aren’t protected by bone and travel dangerously close to the skin. Even a shallow cut can be lethal.
Upper Inner Arms
This is where you’ll find the brachial arteries. The brachial arteries deliver fresh blood to the arms. They run along the inner arms skirting the bottom of the bicep. From about the armpit down to the elbow, a cut in the middle inner arm will result in significant bleeding.
Brachial arteries don’t get a lot of attention in fiction, probably because they’re hard to reach. Writing one into a scene might set the author apart from all those who rely on passé jugular cuts, since it requires some extra imagination.
Kidneys
These beans are the low-hanging fruit of potential knife injuries. A pile of veins and arteries near the kidneys will bawl blood when cut.
The kidneys are located in the lower back on either side of the spine. A character does not need to know much about the exact location. A stab to the lower back will likely suffice.
Genitals
A character playing exceptionally dirty might go for the genitals. Does this area need much explaining? It’s a knife to the genitals. That about sums it up.
Where to Use a Knife on a Character: Challenging Areas
Bone is the last defense against a knife attack, and it’s a surprisingly effective one. It can deflect or stop anything from a bullet to a blade, depending on conditions. That’s bad news for characters wielding a knife as some of the most lethal arteries and veins are protected by bone. A skilled or lucky character can inflict a mortal wound in these areas, but it’s harder to accomplish.
Heart
Penetrating the heart or its many arteries and veins with a knife is a death sentence, but only if the blade can find its way past the ribs and breastbone.
Thrillers and crime fiction often depict stab wounds to the heart as if the character were mutilating a boneless turkey breast. The ribs and breastbone (sternum) are there for a reason, and they’ll take one hell of a beating before they yield. That presents a problem for writers. Here are three suggestions for getting around it.
The character makes a blow with the knife powerful enough to break through the hard plate of the breastbone and/or the ribs to puncture the heart. This requires a physically able character.
The character slips the knife “between the ribs” and into the heart. This maneuver would still take some skill or luck. Thankfully for those in the real world, the ribs don’t offer gaping spaces for easy access to insides. Neither does the breastbone.
If the knife punctures the flesh underneath the breastbone and then pushes up behind it into the heart, the problem is solved. But such a move is just brutal, and it would require a character with some serious strength (and anger issues).
The point is this: The human body is designed to protect the heart at all costs. It takes some doing to reach it with a knife.
Brain
A knife to the brain isn’t always fatal, but it may as well be in fiction. Like the heart, the brain is protected by bone, and the skull is one of the toughest bones in the body. Still there are three access points to consider that don’t involve the skull.
The first is through the ear canal and into the brain. This would require an exceptionally powerful stab and a longer knife. But it’s possible.
Another is through the eyes. This vulnerable area is always a top choice for bringing down a physically dominating character. In addition to being the fleshy doormen to the brain, the eyes can also become blinded with a horizontal cut to the forehead. Of course, a knife to the eye would have a more lasting effect.
The third is up through the nose. It’s an overlooked area. Remember those ice pick lobotomies from back in the day?
“I had one as a kid,” says Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective. “Although the ice pick got stuck up there for a few days, the procedure did help me stop lighting fires.”
Yes, Maynard, you did, and those quack doctors reached your brain through your nose. A blade up a nostril could take that concept to the next level.
Subclavian Arteries and Veins
These arteries and veins are hard-to-reach sweet spots tucked beneath the clavicle (collarbone). A cut to the subclavians takes extra effort, but it’s worth it. Because of the subclavians’ awkward positions under the collarbone, the character has zero chance of applying a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.
Where to Use a Knife on a Character: Painful, but Not Always Deadly
Knife wounds can inflict tortuous pain and injury without imposing an immediate death sentence. Shallow stabs and cuts to the legs, arms, sides, and other “meaty” areas can be painful but not necessarily mortal. Here are some specific and particularly painful places to plant a knife without necessarily causing mortal wounds.
“The Guts”
A knife to a character’s abdominal area can cause a serious injury, but it’s no guarantee of death. It may take time for things to turn south in a major way. Or it might not. This gray area allows for plenty of creative license. But there are a number of organs and arteries (the abdominal aorta, for one) in the guts that, if severed, can ruin someone’s day, year, or life.
“And if the knife doesn’t work, just have them hit up a cheap buffet. That’ll ruin their guts in no time,” Maynard says.
Spine
A cut to the spine will render the character immobile. Death is no guarantee, but the inability to move can definitely increase the chances of it.
Tendons
Snipping a tendon anywhere on the body will result in complications. The classic spot to hit in thrillers and crime fiction is the Achilles tendon, located just behind the heel. Cutting it will render the character unable to stand or walk on that foot. Cut both tendons and the character isn’t going anywhere. This is one trope from books and film that is actually based in reality.
“Does that mean I should stop wearing black socks and sandals?” Maynard says.
If you’re concerned about a slice to the Achilles tendon, it’s best to wear thick work boots. Be sure to consider a character’s footwear when writing such an attack. Is the Achilles easily accessible or not? High heels, for example, offer little protection.
Infection
True, this isn’t a “location,” but any wound, even a superficial one, can become infected and thus painful and deadly if untreated. Speed the process up with a dirty knife or seal the wound with filth and you’ve got a surefire infection on the way. This can lead to drama long after the knife fight is over.
Bleeding Out
Again, not a location, but a serious threat. Any deep cut has the potential to kill, not just the ones located in the various sweet spots. As with infection, it just takes patience and creativity to kill a character this way. And a small cut lengthwise along any artery or vein (even a small one) can cause a flood of blood.
How to Dismember a Character
Thankfully I have zero real-world experience with the violent dismemberment of a deceased human being. Perhaps unsurprisingly, resources for this topic were hard to locate for this guide (outside of a few death metal bands with questionable medical credentials).
However, chopping up a body isn’t all that uncommon in fiction, especially for plots that feature serials killers and organized crime. Here are a few pointers for those stories.
One of the most infamous scenes from the movie Scarface involves a drug dealer using a chainsaw to dismember another character in a bathroom. Chainsaws come up quite a bit for dismemberment scenes, but I get the feeling they make cleanup more difficult. A character trying to cover her tracks might opt for knives instead to better direct the carnage.
Also, using a chainsaw indoors is suspicious and could draw unwanted attention, not to mention exhaust fumes. “Unless using chainsaws indoors is a common thing for that setting, of course,” Maynard says. “I always use one for carving turkeys in the RV.”
Uh, yeah, of course.
Do the tools fit the task? Characters would need heavy-duty knives, usually fixed blades, to complete this gruesome work. If none are available, it’s time to get creative.
Does the character fit the task? Dismemberment is physically demanding. Is the character up for the job? Maynard, for example, is frail and has a bad back. He’s no Buffalo Bill or Deputy Lou Ford.
Writers are free to conduct research firsthand and write me from prison about the results, but I’m not suggesting they do.
A Quick Word About Forensics
The use of forensic science in fiction is a topic that deserves its own separate guide—it’s actually a subject that could fill several volumes—but there are some important points to mention here.
In his article Forensic Autopsy of Sharp Force Injuries for Medscape.com, Dr. Joseph A. Prahlow, a forensic pathologist at the South Bend Medical Foundation, busts three myths about CSI-ing knife injuries Hollywood style.
First, he says, “Forensic pathologists are usually unable to determine the direction of infliction of an incised wound.” The shape of a wound doesn’t necessarily indicate whether it was made right to left, left to right, up-down, etc. The exception is when flesh alongside the wound points to a particular route.
Second, forensic pathologists can’t tell if the attacker was right-handed or left-handed based on the injury, or whether the attacker was in front of or behind the victim. For example, an injury might appear the same with a right-handed attacker standing in front as a left-hander from behind.
Finally, a knife injury has little to say about the blade characteristics. Wound depth, width, and length could all be smaller, equal to, or larger than the blade’s dimensions.
So just because your favorite movie includes one of these forensic scenes, it doesn’t mean the information gleaned therein is true or accurate.
