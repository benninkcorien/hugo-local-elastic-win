Rifles 101, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Rifles 101
Rifles work best over longer distances and in tactical situations. They offer power and precision. Rifle calibers abound, but most practical for fiction (sorted least to most powerful) are the .17, .22, .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, .30-06, 7mm, .338, and .50. The larger the number, the greater the firepower. A .50 has more firepower than a .22.
Semi-Automatic Rifles
Here’s a look at the parts of a semi-auto rifle, specifically the AR-15, one of the most popular civilian rifles. The terms in this image would be similar for other rifles. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Popular semi-automatic rifles: Colt AR-15, Browning BAR, Ruger 10/22, Springfield Armory M1 Garand
A semi-automatic rifle functions much the same way as a semi-automatic shotgun—one pull of the trigger equals one shell fired. A character cannot hold down the trigger to continuously fire; only fully automatic rifles can do that, and they are covered in their own section in a few pages.
Generally speaking, a shooter would load a semi-auto rifle in one of three ways. The most common, and of most use to writers, is to insert a detachable magazine of ammunition into the firearm. A second method is to load cartridges (another term for shell or round) one at a time into a magazine built into the firearm (called an internal magazine). The least common way is to insert a clip of several cartridges bundled together into an internal magazine.
The shooter then works a charging handle (a small knob or tab) back and forth one time to move a cartridge out of the magazine and into the chamber (the spot inside the firearm where a cartridge is seated to be fired). Only after the first cartridge is fired does the rifle’s semi-automatic action take over. It harnesses energy from the recoil from each shot to simultaneously unload and reload ammunition.
Some fully automatic rifles, usually leftover military models, are modified to function as semi-automatics only. This makes them more marketable, since the law places many restrictions on fully automatics. That’s a point worth considering if a character doesn’t have access to a black market yet needs an aggressive-looking firearm.
Advantages
Semi-automatic rifles enjoy far fewer restrictions than fully automatics. Because of this, a variety of calibers (not gauges) are available for any number of needs.
Compared to bolt-action and pump-action rifles, semi-automatics can fire shells faster. However, the increase in speed is not usually that great because recoil can negate it. The operator has to aim again.
Scores of modifications for semi-automatic rifles can be had. This is especially true in recent years, with the popularity of the AR-15, a firearm suited to accessories and modification. Characters needing an especially customized firearm might choose a semi-automatic rifle.
Disadvantages
As with any automatic firearm, semi-automatic rifles contain moving parts prone to failures and jams. By comparison, a bolt-action rifle is much more reliable. But, as I’ve mentioned before, a well-timed mechanical failure may come in handy at some point in your writing. The most common problem is fired cartridges becoming jammed inside the rifle when they are supposed to eject.
Semi-autos are prohibited in some areas and situations. Adjust your setting based on real-world regulations.
Converting a semi-auto rifle to a fully automatic version requires a ton of gunsmithing know-how that is out of reach or too onerous for most people. Such a conversion is like switching a car’s manual transmission with an automatic one. It’s not easy, and it’s also illegal. Characters in settings prior to May 19, 1986, (the date the Firearm Owners Protection Act went into effect) would have a less challenging time making the conversion, since there was still a legal market for homemade fully automatics. But nowadays? Forget it. Unless a character has an extensive understanding of firearms or outside (criminal) help, no number of illegal kits over the Internet or mail are going to make conversion as easy as one, two, three.
Inaccurate Example
Through the scope, Bill Robber could see the damage his rifle inflicted on Maynard Soloman. The first two shots shattered each of the sleuth’s knees, sending him to the ground. The third demolished a hip. Each pull of the trigger ejected another red and yellow chunk from Maynard’s body.
Bill lit a cigarette and reloaded his assault weapon’s clip with a quick pump. With Maynard down for the count, he could relax and enjoy using the detective for target practice.
“I’ll be dipped—I knew I should’ve brought something more than a screwdriver to this gunfight,” Maynard said before dying. “Well, you win some, you lose some.”

What Went Wrong?
The first paragraph of the inaccurate example suggests Bill is firing a semi-automatic rifle. Each pull of the trigger appears to fire one shot.
However, things get complicated in the second paragraph. Bill is suddenly reloading his “assault weapon’s clip with a quick pump.” What is an assault weapon? Is it a fully automatic rifle? A semi-automatic rifle? Or something else? Assault weapon doesn’t have a set definition. Semi-automatic rifle and fully automatic rifle do, though, and they won’t confuse readers like assault weapon will. Pick one, say what it is, be consistent, and avoid using vague terminology.
Also, the vast majority of semi-automatic rifles use detachable magazines—mags for short—instead of clips. Unless Bill’s rifle model specifically uses clips, magazine is the better term. And reloading that rifle wouldn’t involve pumping any part of the firearm unless the rifle model is specifically a pump-action. Although there are pump-action rifles out there, my experience as a reader is that some writers reload every firearm with “a quick pump” a la pump-action shotguns.
This highlights two important things. First, a lot can go wrong in only seven words. Second, it’s a good idea to choose a specific firearm to write about to avoid inconsistencies—even if the exact gun model is never revealed. For example, I might have a Colt AR-15 in mind when writing about a generic semi-automatic rifle. That gives me details about the rifle to stick to throughout the story.
Fully Automatic Firearms
Popular fully automatic firearms: Avtomat Kalashnikov 47 (AK-47), Fabrique Nationale FAL, Colt M16, M4, Thompson submachine gun (Tommy gun)
A fully automatic firearm is capable of firing more than one time per pull of the trigger. The action (the mechanism that cycles ammunition through the firearm) captures force from the recoil to continuously move cartridges in and out of the chamber. A detachable magazine usually feeds the ammunition. A long belt of ammunition is another option.
Much like semi-automatic rifles, preparing a fully automatic to fire requires the operator to insert a detachable magazine (not a clip) loaded with ammunition into the firearm. Then the operator works the charging handle (a small tab or knob located near the chamber) back and forth one time to move a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber (the spot inside the firearm where the cartridge is seated to be fired). The gun is ready to fire.
Fully automatic firearms fall into one of two categories: submachine guns and machine guns. The primary difference is in their ammunition. Machine guns use rifle ammunition and are more powerful. Submachine guns use pistol ammunition and are less powerful.
Does that mean submachine guns are actually amped-up pistols? That’s true in some cases but not all. It usually depends on the size of the firearm. Small models approaching pistol sizes might be called machine pistols. Larger models leaning toward rifle sizes might be called submachine guns. There isn’t a clear line in the sand, though. The best bet is to stick to the submachine gun term.
Since they use the same type of ammunition, the term fully automatic rifle can be used interchangeably with machine gun. If you’re unsure whether machine gun or submachine gun is the right term to use, go with full-auto or fully automatic instead.
Fully automatic firearms are highly restricted, and they’re difficult to obtain—even when you fill out the proper paperwork and pay the fees. In the United States, civilians may only possess fully automatics that were made before May 19, 1986.
So why are there videos of people online shooting “new” full-autos? If they’re within the law, they’re using pre-1986 parts and housing them inside new bodies. Remember, function matters with firearm laws, not form. (Check out the upcoming section on firearm laws for a more thorough rundown of automatic firearm restrictions.)
Some fully automatic firearms feature toggles that adjust the rate of fire. Depending on the model, a character could switch between fully automatic, a burst of only a few shots, a semi-automatic mode, and back again. Firearms with this toggle are said to be select-fire.
Advantages
If a character needs to put the fear of God into someone, he or she should bring a fully automatic firearm to a fight. Its mere presence is intimidating.
Fully automatic firearms crank out more shots in a shorter period of time than any other firearm.
An automatic firearm will often inflict multiple wounds due to the high rate of fire.
Modern fully automatic rifles (machine guns) can be effective at long ranges. A character would need a lot of experience to shoot accurately, though.
Outfitting a character with a fully automatic firearm says something about her. There’s a good reason the character has it, and that reason probably isn’t to protect herself when she picks up the kids after soccer practice.
Disadvantages
Accuracy is a problem with fully automatics. The stereotype for these firearms is a shooter holding down the trigger and spraying an area with bullets. That’s the worst way to depict a full-auto if you’re trying to be accurate. The constant bucking and jerking of the recoil would send bullets flying every which way. The most effective way to fire fully automatics is in short bursts. Doing so keeps clusters of bullets on target and recoil in check, but it takes experience to get the technique right.
Legal restrictions make fully automatic firearms difficult for civilians to purchase or possess. Characters in law enforcement or the military are most likely to use them. Criminals may find their own means of obtaining them as well. Again, check out the section on firearm laws to understand what’s possible and what’s unrealistic.
There’s no mistaking the sound of a fully automatic firearm’s rapid fire. This distinct sound isn’t helpful for a character trying to keep his activity on the down low.
More moving parts means more chances for things to go wrong. Fully automatic firearms are highly susceptible to jamming, and they require considerable maintenance to function properly.
Fully automatic firearms can empty their magazines in a few seconds. Unless a character has preloaded magazines on hand, plan on her taking a couple of minutes or more to reload the mag with ammunition. Remember that loaded magazines carry considerable weight. Stuffing a few into a pocket means those pants will be around the character’s ankles if a belt isn’t present.
Of all the different firearms, fully automatics have the steepest learning curve. Machine guns and submachine guns aren’t something a person masters in an afternoon. Characters either need experience or the ability to figure out their operation quickly.
Inaccurate Example
Bill Robber, chronic check-kiting enthusiast, kicked open the door to the crowded First City Bank of Overdraft Fees. He opened up with his submachine gun and let the lead fly for a solid minute. Two dozen bodies folded onto the concrete.
Maynard Soloman managed to dodge Bill’s death rain by locking himself in the bathroom. But that didn’t prevent Bill from finding him.
“Come on out, Maynard. I’m not leaving any witnesses,” Bill said.
“Go to hell, you dewdroppin’ four-flusher,” Maynard said from behind the bathroom door, dropping his signature old-timey insults—and something else into his pants.
Bill held down the trigger. A cloud of bullets dissolved the bathroom door and drained the warmth from Maynard’s insides. The gal-damn detective said a prayer as his life ended perched against a toilet.
A SWAT team answered the prayer a few seconds later. Bill hosed the officers in lead from his machine gun before making off with $27 and a handful of breath mints.
“Totally worth it,” Bill said to himself in the mirror of his getaway car.

Maynard Soloman managed to dodge Bill’s death rain by locking himself in the bathroom. But that didn’t prevent Bill from finding him.
“Come on out, Maynard. I’m not leaving any witnesses,” Bill said and popped a fresh magazine into the machine gun.
“Go to hell, you dewdroppin’ four-flusher,” Maynard said from behind the bathroom door, dropping his signature old-timey insults—and something else into his pants.
Bill held down the trigger. A cloud of bullets dissolved the bathroom door and drained the warmth from Maynard’s insides. The gal-damn detective said a prayer as his life ended perched against a toilet.
A SWAT team answered it a few seconds later. Bill raised his gun to shoot but only heard a single click. Out of ammo.
The officers spared no time shooting Bill to death.
What Went Wrong?
Consistency is a big problem in the inaccurate example. Is Bill using a machine gun or a submachine gun? It’s written both ways. It’s an important choice. He needs to demolish the bathroom door Maynard is hiding behind. A machine gun, the more powerful of the two, is the better bet for handling that task.
This scenario also presented a classic case of the magic machine gun that never runs out of ammunition. It’s assumed Bill did a lot of shooting in the beginning, having killed two dozen people. He needed to reload before “dissolving” the bathroom door to kill Maynard. Bill probably needed to reload again just as the SWAT team arrived. Since he only had a few seconds, it’s unlikely he had the time. That’s why the SWAT team killed him in the accurate example.
Did you notice the click when Bill ran out of ammunition? It only happened once. That’s more accurate than writing in multiple clicks as the trigger is pulled, a common trope in fiction when the ammo runs dry. Without getting too technical, that click sound comes from the gun attempting to fire. The only way it can reset itself to click again is to actually fire. But if the ammunition is out, that can’t happen. The result is just one click.
Bolt-Action Rifles
Bolt-action rifles are generally used for precision shooting. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Popular bolt-action rifles: Browning A-Bolt, McMillan TAC-50, Remington Model 700, Springfield Model 1903, Winchester Model 70
A bolt-action rifle uses a sliding metal cylinder (bolt) to move shells in and out of the chamber (the spot inside the firearm where the shell is seated to be fired). The operator manually shifts the bolt-action (it looks like a metal knob on the side of the gun) up and back to eject a shell from the chamber. Then the operator moves the knob forward and down to seat the next shell from the magazine (the place where ammunition is held in reserve) into the chamber. With the bolt-action in this forward-down position, the rifle is ready to fire.
If the bolt is not in the forward-down position, it’s mechanically impossible for this type of rifle to fire.
Bolt-action rifles use either an internal or detachable magazine. Internally, shells rarely exceed single-digit capacities. A magazine with up to six shells is pretty common, depending on caliber. Detachable magazines have a much greater capacity.
Some detachable magazines are flush with the stock of the rifle. This detail might not be clear if you simply peruse Internet photos of rifles when researching for a story. Double-check the model’s specs to be sure. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
To fire the first shot, the operator would first insert a magazine or load shells into an internal magazine, then manually work the bolt. After switching off the safety, the gun is ready to fire. The operator would work the bolt between each consecutive shot to unload and reload.
Remember: There is nothing automatic about a bolt-action rifle. The operator must manually work the action at all times. Also, bolt-action rifles don’t have hammers, but they do have a safety button or safety switch. On some models, the safety must be off for the bolt-action to move freely, meaning the character can load and reload only if the safety is off. Even with the safety off, it is mechanically impossible for the rifle to fire unless the bolt is in the forward-down position.
Advantages
A bolt-action rifle is more reliable than other rifles. It has fewer moving parts than an automatic rifle. It’s also dependent on the shooter (rather than the recoil) to work the action. Unless the shooter loses a hand between shots, the action is going to cycle ammunition through the rifle.
A case could be made that bolt-actions are more accurate than their semi-automatic counterparts. There’s plenty of room for debate, but characters needing to fire over long distances would likely choose a bolt-action rifle. Sniper characters are great candidates for bolt-action rifles.
Compared to other rifles, bolt-action rifles have fewer restrictions placed on them, so characters will have an easier time obtaining one.
The popularity of bolt-action rifles is worldwide. You are virtually guaranteed that every rifle caliber is available as a bolt-action. This should make it easier on writers looking for a generic rifle type to use as a default.
Disadvantages
Characters who need to put out a lot of lead might shy away from bolt-action rifles. They’re slower to reload and to re-sight between shots.
The fact that the safety must be off in order to move the bolt could be a concern. This counterintuitive setup could confuse characters new to bolt-actions. Even worse, they might forget to switch the safety on when the action is in the forward-down position. Accidents convenient to the plot could happen this way.
Despite their reliability, bolt-action rifles can still become jammed when reloading. When inserted at the right moment, these jams can be critical to a story.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman bolted into the shop with the XXX sign above the door, rifle in hand.
“Which one of you latrine dippers is making gal-damn moonshine in here?” Maynard said to a woman next to a window.
“Uh, we’re not that kind of store. You’ve got the wrong place,” the woman said. “Are you here to rob my store?”
“No, but I’m not leaving here without arresting someone for something, or I don’t get paid,” Maynard said. He worked the bolt on his rifle to load the first round.
“I’m not going anywhere,” the woman said and produced a revolver.
Maynard took aim and shot the revolver out of her hand, then quickly pulled the trigger again to send the woman through the window.
Accurate Example
Maynard Soloman bolted into the shop with the XXX sign above the door, rifle in hand.
“Which one of you latrine dippers is making gal-damn moonshine in here?” Maynard said to a woman next to a window.
“Uh, we’re not that kind of store. You’ve got the wrong place,” the woman said. “Are you here to rob my store?”
“No, but I’m not leaving here without arresting someone for something, or I don’t get paid,” Maynard said.
“I’m not going anywhere,” the woman said and produced a revolver.
Acting quickly, Maynard took aim and shot the woman’s shoulder, forcing her to drop the revolver. Without skipping a beat, he reloaded and pulled the trigger again. The woman slumped to the ground as the window shattered behind her.
What Went Wrong?
Aside from Maynard’s botched moonshine raid, let’s start with how he entered the shop without having a shell in the chamber. He waits to load when he needs to accent a point. If he’s anticipating a firefight, it’s best to be ready for it. I reinforce this point throughout this guide only because it happens quite a bit in fiction.
When Maynard fires in the inaccurate example, he doesn’t pause to reload. It’s as if his rifle will continue to fire with each pull of the trigger after working the bolt one time. That’s incorrect. The bolt-action must be worked each time between shots.
Shooting a gun out of a hand is a trope from schlocky Western movies. That should tell you something about the realism (or lack of it) in this scene. The better bet is to have a character hit the hand or arm holding the gun. Those body parts are larger targets and easier to hit. A real-life scenario on this topic is presented in the true crime section.
This example also rolls out the “character hit by gunfire flies through window” trope. Remember Newton’s Third Law of Motion: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If Maynard’s shot packs enough punch to send the woman through the window, it should knock him backward with the same amount of force. He should slam against a wall behind him. He doesn’t.
This is corrected in the accurate example. Instead of the woman flying through the window, she slumps onto the ground.
What about the window shattering? In the accurate example, I assumed the bullet broke the window when it passed through the woman instead of remaining inside her. That choice was up to me as the writer, but it highlights an important point. Keep track of those bullets. They don’t dissipate into the air. Ask yourself if the bullet remains in the target character or continues traveling. If it does keep going, does it hit some other part of the scene?
Pump-Action Rifles
This is a short section because pump-action rifles play a relatively small role in thrillers and crime fiction.
Pump-action rifles are most common with smaller calibers, such as the .17 and the .22. The most popular pump-action rifle caliber is the .22. It’s not a high-power caliber, but a shot from one could still wreck someone’s day. To put its firepower into perspective, I use a pump .22 with a scope for my family’s annual squirrel hunt. (Yes, that’s really a thing. Yes, we make the finest buffalo squirrel wings on this side of the Mississippi. But that’s a story for another day.)
Unless your character is young or is hunting small game, you will probably be better off using larger caliber semi-automatic, fully automatic, and bolt-action rifles for characters looking to do some damage.
Pump-action rifles are sometimes called slide-action rifles, and they function similarly to pump-action shotguns. They usually use a tube magazine that runs underneath the barrel to store ammunition. One pump simultaneously ejects a fired cartridge from the chamber and replaces it with a fresh one from the magazine. Capacities can be quite high, into the teens and beyond. That’s one of the biggest advantages of pump-action rifles.
And, as stated earlier, pumping one of these rifles for dramatic effect doesn’t make sense.
Finally, don’t take any of these points to mean that pump-action rifles are off-limits to you as a writer. They’re still fine to include. Just don’t drop them into intense tactical situations if you can help it.
Lever-Action Rifles
Lever-actions, such as this Winchester 1886, are commonly found on older or classically inspired rifles. For all practical purposes, write them similar to pump-actions. The only difference is the lever used to work the action. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
When writing, think of lever-action rifles as the grown-up version of pump-action rifles. They function similarly, except they use a lever instead of a pump.
The key difference is the ammunition. Lever-action rifles, including the famous Winchester Model 94 (see the Hit List section of this guide), can get into the midpower calibers, such as the .30-30.
Lever-action rifles aren’t as prominent in thrillers and crime fiction (although they’re standard fare in Westerns), so they’re not explored in detail here. Writers might still appreciate knowing that the external hammer automatically cocks as the lever is worked. As with pump-action firearms, dramatic hammer cocking (or dramatic lever working) for intimidation is usually unnecessary and will empty unfired ammo onto the ground.
