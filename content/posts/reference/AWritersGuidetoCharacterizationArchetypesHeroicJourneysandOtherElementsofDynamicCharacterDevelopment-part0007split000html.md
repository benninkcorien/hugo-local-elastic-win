A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 2FEMALE INTERACTIONS
In this chapter you will learn how all the female archetypes interact with each other. Not only will this information help you when you create supporting characters, it will also assist you in creating ensemble pieces (stories with two or more main characters who interact with each other). Supporting characters may have their own archetype, depending on how involved they are in the story.
Think of The First Wives Club, The Big Chill, and Thelma and Louise as ensemble story examples. They each have several main characters who take up almost equal story time. Each one of their problems moves the story forward.
Think of Alien and The Wizard of Oz as nonensemble story examples. They each have a main heroine (Ripley and Dorothy, respectively). Everyone else, except for the villain, is a supporting character.
In some cases you will notice that an ability or aspect of an archetype is so strong that no matter who you pair that character with, she will teach the same thing. That’s okay. It just shows how strong an influence this aspect of her archetype is on the others.
The following pages show you how every female archetype interacts with every other female archetype. No matter how many main characters you have—you will be able to figure out how they mesh together.
Will you be writing an ensemble story, or will you have just one main heroine?
Here’s where you’ll start thinking about the other characters in your story.
CODE:
=They will generally get along from the beginning.
=They will generally clash from the beginning.
