A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
People like to see characters reach the highest level of mastery in their field. But we want to see them do it only after facing a lot of hardship. Since this lesson applies to heroes such as Beethoven or Mozart, who are really good at what they do, this makes for a problem. Their talent comes easily so their hardship will probably come from an element of angst and inner suffering—perhaps, the tortured artist syndrome. It also may come from other character issues, like mental and emotional issues and events from the past that come in and threaten to sway the character in the direction of self-sabotage. Talent will win out, especially if surrounding characters enjoy what the hero can do and won’t want him to give up.
We find these stories interesting because the character’s talent comes so easily, but other parts of his life suffer and are pushed aside because the hero finds so much passion in what he is doing. Just as he reaches the highest level of talent, the other areas of life fall apart. We enjoy watching the character deal with those conflicts. Everyone is looking for their purpose in life, so an audience will definitely relate.
