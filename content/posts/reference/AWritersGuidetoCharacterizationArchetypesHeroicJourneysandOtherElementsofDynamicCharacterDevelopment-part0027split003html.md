A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
A character might resist this lesson because he may not feel deserving of such goodness in his life of some reason. He also may not understand exactly what’s happening. In the beginning stages he may feel very much like he is losing his identity and everything about who he is. If humans went through what the butterfly goes though in order to mature, the transformation of being born as an adult would be extremely intense.
In the beginning, when the hero is facing what will happen, he may feel unworthy or afraid of the unknown. There is no trauma, nothing is pushing him to do this, but he experiences fear of the unknown.
