A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE NURTURER AND THE MATRIARCH
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
The Nurturer and the Matriarch both take care of others but the Nurturer isn’t as in control as the Matriarch is. The Matriarch wonders why the Nurturer gives so much to those outside of her family.
The Nurturer doesn’t understand why the Matriarch demands ‘payment’ for her services and expects people to act in a certain way. If the Nurturer is not careful in her relationship with the Matriarch, she will find herself under the Matriarch’s control. The Matriarch can be very dominating, especially around someone who is so accommodating.
The Matriarch can teach the Nurturer to value her ‘services’ and to demand respect at the very least.
The Nurturer can teach the Matriarch that the people she helps already repay her in ways she can’t begin to understand. They sometimes come back to help her because they are grateful, not because they owe her something.
