Suppressors, Silencers, Scopes, and Sights
Suppressors and Silencers
Thrillers and crime fiction depict silencers unrealistically all the time. Television shows, books, and movies often show these supernatural devices reducing a controlled explosion of gunpowder from a handgun, rifle, or shotgun to the sound of a gerbil fart. The truth is nothing like fiction.
Let’s start with the name: silencer. Suppressor is the more accurate term. Silencer became adopted colloquially, and it’s easy to see why. These tubular modifications, screwed into the end of a barrel, reduce the sound of a shot being fired. But reduced is not silenced. They “suppress.” That’s why they’re more accurately called suppressors.
Before I dive into how exactly that works, let me clarify something—I don’t think it’s necessarily wrong to use the term silencer. It’s just technically inaccurate. Still, the usage of silencer is so common that it might confuse readers to use suppressor. So if writers want to use silencer because it’s simpler, I won’t suppress them, but I still think it’s valuable to understand why suppressor is the more accurate term.
How Suppressors (Don’t) Work
Generally speaking, the sounds suppressors muffle are the sharp, high-pitched cracks from the shot. The rest of the noise will still echo all across that “dark and stormy night.”
The ignition of gunpowder inside a cartridge produces a powerful blast of gas. It’s that gas that makes gunshots so noisy. If the gas is contained inside something as it exits the barrel, like the tube of a suppressor, much of the explosive noise is reduced.
Reduced—not eliminated. The best suppressors capture the most gas, but there’s yet to be a model that contains all of it. Some gas still manages to escape and make noise.
Even if a suppressor contains 100 percent of the gas, that gunshot is still going to make noise. That’s because of a little thing called the sound barrier. The speed of sound is 1,126 feet per second (fps). That’s pretty slow in the land of firearms. Most ammunition can easily hurry past 1,126 fps. The ammunition in the .270 rifle I use for deer hunting clocks in around 3,000 fps. An object traveling faster than the speed of sound will create noise. The best suppressors in the world can’t bend the laws of physics.
Do Suppressors Actually Make a Difference?
None of this is to say suppressors don’t make a difference. They certainly do. A noticeable reduction in noise occurs when a suppressor is used. However, the reduction is not always huge, and the resulting shot won’t involve the joot sound Hollywood so often employs.
Nothing I write can tell that story quite like a trip to YouTube. There you’ll find many side-by-side comparisons of suppressed and nonsuppressed firearms, but one of the best I’ve found is at tinyurl.com/suppressor-comparison. It demonstrates much of what’s explained in this section.
The videos also highlight a noise many writers don’t consider: the normal function of the firearm itself. Even a fictional suppressor that absorbs every bit of the shot’s sound can’t cover up the click of the firing pin, the cacophony of the action cycling ammunition, and the various other metallic workings of the firearm. A firearm is a mechanical object that makes mechanical sounds. Total silence can't be achieved so long as moving parts are involved.
So, does it make sense to outfit a character with a suppressor? That depends on the scene. If total silence is required, a suppressor isn’t going to cut it. For characters trying not to be noticed amidst other background noises, suppressors will do the trick.
In the real world, outside of the military and law enforcement, suppressors are often used for special hunts near residential areas as a courtesy to those living nearby.
The Secret to Successful Suppressors: Subsonic Ammunition
Subsonic ammunition is designed to stay under 1,126 fps. This is most often associated with .17 and .22 ammunition, although calibers all the way up to the .50 can be subsonic.
Pairing subsonic ammo with a suppressor will drastically reduce the noise. The shot doesn’t produce much gas, and the bullet isn’t breaking the sound barrier. That’s the secret to using suppressors. Writers looking to add some realism to a covert operation might have their characters use suppressors and subsonic ammunition.
There’s a trade-off, though: Subsonic speeds reduce the amount of force the projectile exerts on a target, called “stopping power.” When it comes to putting a character down, stopping power is a good thing. Not enough stopping power means a character may need some extra coercing to die. Firing from closer ranges will always be the better bet. Point blank is ideal.
One final note: Subsonic ammunition is slow—but only in terms of firearms. It doesn’t mean the shooting character needs to fire ahead of a moving target (called leading the target) any more than normal.
Legality of Suppressors
Suppressors are considered Class III devices under the 1934 National Firearms Act and require ATF registration, just like fully automatic firearms. Law enforcement and military organizations are exempted, and they often have access to better suppressors that trap more gas than civilian models. That still doesn’t mean they don’t make noise, though.
The law might not matter to some characters, but it’s important to understand this bit of trivia anyway.
DIY Suppressors
Erotica isn’t the only genre with some wild ideas about pillow positioning. Thrillers and crime fiction do, too. According to many novels, you can just hold a pillow against a firearm’s barrel and pull the trigger in perfect silence.
Remember that trapping the gas coming out of the barrel is key to reducing noise. A pillow is soft and full of fluff. While it can trap the breath of a hospital patient who “knows too much,” it’s not going to lock in gas escaping a metal tube at 3,000 fps. The gunshot will still make noise.
The same goes for using socks, hats, gloves, blankets, grocery bags of food, pumpkins, roadkill, cheeseburgers, pog collections, pickle jars, phone books, and the rest. For any fictional DIY (do-it-yourself) suppressor to reflect reality, it must be able to lock in gas while allowing a projectile to pass through without affecting accuracy. So when you are writing about one, make sure you use your imagination.
Here are a few items that, once modified, have a chance of actually working as DIY suppressors. Steps to create them aren’t included in this guide, since manufacturing suppressors, even crappy homemade ones, requires special licensure from the federal government (another thing to keep in mind when writing).
flashlight
oil filter
PVC pipe
aluminum pipe
water balloon (one-time use only, of course)
Insert these DIY suppressors into the writing instead of pillows, and the story’s street cred will go way up.
Can Revolvers Be Suppressed?
It’s been said that revolvers cannot be suppressed. There’s a tiny gap between the cylinder and the barrel. Gas, and therefore noise, escapes through the gap, negating any benefit a suppressor might offer.
It’s also been said that the amount of gas escaping is minimal and that a suppressor is still beneficial.
Then someone else said there are certain revolver models that don’t have that gap. A suppressor would work just as well on those revolvers as it would on a pistol.
Yet a fourth person said that whomever ordered pizza needs to pay for it, because the delivery guy is about to leave.
Yes, things get confusing in a hurry when talking about suppressed revolvers. The only real gap at play is one of agreement. There isn’t any clean, fully agreed-upon answer.
Having said that, does it make sense to write about suppressed revolvers?
Yes. In my opinion, I think you should go for it. The majority of gas created by a revolver shot exits the barrel like any other firearm. That means a suppressor would still help. If presented with a choice, though, assign the character a suppressed pistol instead. There’s no reason to enter into this argument unnecessarily. Leave that to the voicemails of authors of gun guides.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman knew Bill Robber was in either room 237 or 217 at the Ov rlook Ho el (the hotel’s neon sign was neglected, possibly to avoid a copyright infringement). The trick would be to shoot him without waking anyone up. At this late hour, the hotel was completely booked.
Maynard snapped a silencer onto the end of his .50 caliber Desert Eagle pistol before slipping into the first room through the window. Bingo. Looking up from the pillows of his king-sized bed, Bill appeared to be surprised.
“Did you say your prayers tonight?” Maynard said and shined a flashlight into Bill’s eyes with his free hand.
Bill started to say something, but Maynard didn’t let him respond. He held a pillow against the silencer for good measure, then pulled the trigger until the drapes in the room matched the dingy red carpet.
It would be hours before hotel staff found Bill’s body. Plenty of time for Maynard to cross three state lines in his RV and make a clean escape.

Maynard screwed a silencer into the end of his 9mm Beretta 92 pistol before slipping into the first room through the window. Bingo. Looking up from the pillows of his king-sized bed, Bill appeared to be surprised.

The hotel lit up as the other guests woke in a panic. People flooded the hallways. Rats bolted from the toilets. Staff canceled the continental breakfast.
Security guards arrived at room 237 in a matter of seconds. They tackled Maynard and dialed 911.
What Went Wrong?
Given he’s at a crowded hotel, Maynard required total silence in this scenario. Unfortunately a suppressor can’t offer that, not even with the addition of a pillow pressed against it. That’s why Maynard’s plan went to ruin in the accurate example. This correction might’ve gone differently with a couple of alternatives. Maynard could’ve smothered Bill with a pillow or strangled him with a cord, provided I gave him more time to surprise his target.
Maynard did head in the right direction by switching from a .50 caliber Desert Eagle to a 9mm Beretta in the accurate example. Assuming he had the choice, Maynard would leave the .50 at home. Even with a suppressor, it’s a noisy hand cannon that’s not cut out for stealth. The 9mm makes much less noise and is a better fit. Here again is a general ranking of handgun calibers sorted by least to greatest firepower, a good indicator of noise: .22, .25, .32, .38, 9mm, .40, 10mm, .357, .45, .44, and .50.
Also, Maynard should screw in the silencer instead of snapping it in place.
Left unchanged in the accurate version was the silencer reference. As mentioned previously in this section, the term is so popular that using suppressor would probably cause more confusion than it’s worth.
Scopes and Sights
Scopes and sights help increase accuracy, but they’re not the last word in shot placement, as you’ll see. The terms scope and sight are sometimes used interchangeably. In some cases this is accurate, but I think it spares confusion to follow this rule: Use scope when referring to a telescoping lens. Use sight when referring to hardware that lacks a telescoping lens.
It generally takes more time to line up a shot with a scope than it does with a sight. First, when you look through a scope, it can take a second to find the target. A scope may need to zoom in or out, depending on the distance from the target, while a sight requires the user to simply look, aim, and shoot. There’s no need to find the target in the scope first. That’s why sights are quicker.
A scope on a handgun? With some larger hunting revolvers, this makes sense. With a bit of creativity, a scope could be mounted to a pistol—but it’s not common. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Most firearms come with sights built into them, while a scope is an adjustable, telescoping lens mounted on top of a firearm. Scopes are best for characters needing to make an accurate, long-distance shot; they are challenging to use at close ranges. If a character using a scoped firearm comes upon a target up close, he might have to shoot without any visual aid.
The lines used for aiming when looking through a scope are called a reticle. The classic crosshairs, commonly used in thrillers and crime fiction, are a type of reticle. However, scores of reticles exist. Some even help determine range and ballistics information using a few quick calculations. For a comprehensive rundown on types of reticles, head to www.gundigest.com/reticlebook for a free PDF from Gun Digest.
Sights are pieces of hardware fixed to a firearm and used to line up shots. They don’t contain a telescoping lens. Sights are most effective for mid- to close-range targets. It’s not impossible, but it is difficult for a character to make a long-range shot with a sight. Some sights are pieces of metal, such as a bead. Others are strips of colorful fiber optic.
The bright design of fiber-optic sights makes it easier to aim quickly. Since they’re a relatively recent innovation, only modern characters would use them. They work best on shotguns and handguns. They’re also used on rifles in place of open sights when precision isn’t a must. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Some sights are tubes mounted on top of a firearm like a scope. The difference is they don’t magnify the target. Instead they use batteries to illuminate a reticle, which is useful for low-light conditions. They might also display a red dot inside the tube used for aiming. This is known as a red dot sight. A shooter might use one for faster aiming, since the battery-powered red dot is so bright.
A variation of the red dot sight is the red dot scope, which sports a telescoping lens.
Don’t confuse red dot sights and scopes with laser sights. Laser sights are a popular choice in fiction, and they should not be written interchangeably with red dot sights and scopes. The classic image of law enforcement officers covering a suspect in red or green cherries is courtesy of laser sights, not red dot sights. When writing laser sights, remember these tips:
Think of laser sights like laser pointers attached to a gun.
They’re useful for low-light conditions or as a backup when the shooter cannot see into the regular sight or scope.
Laser sights can act as a useful distraction for tactical or intimidation purposes, too. Nothing says, “You’re screwed,” or “I’m watching you,” like a meandering red dot. That’s something traditional scopes and sights can’t offer.
Red laser sights are the most popular, but green versions are catching up. Some say green sights work better in daytime conditions.
Laser sights require batteries, and batteries add weight to the firearm that can throw off an otherwise comfortable aim. These sights are also expensive. That means more experienced or well-heeled characters would likely use laser sights over less experienced or less affluent ones.
Laser sights are available to the public, as well as law enforcement and the military.
Most laser sights are accurate out to around 20 yards. The laser can project beyond that, but it’s not as effective for the shooter’s aim. As explained in the Ballistics section of this book, bullets don’t actually travel in straight lines like a laser.
Laser sights are most commonly installed on pistols and rifles. Fiction sometimes pairs them with scoped sniper rifles. This isn’t practical for aiming purposes, so just use the scope in your writing.
Laser sights were first used by law enforcement in 1984. They didn’t gain widespread use until around 1994. If a story takes place prior to 1984, don’t write in a laser sight.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman got to work setting up his perch high above the busy city street. He loaded up his sniper rifle and studied the traffic below.
Some shady clients had paid him $50 (they had a coupon) to assassinate the newest appointee in the department of transportation, Undersecretary of Parking Tickets Dick Move. Needing to pay off the impound lot where his beloved RV sat, Maynard enthusiastically accepted the job.
Once Undersecretary Move’s motorcade appeared one block away, Maynard switched on the red dot sight on his rifle. Through the scope, he could see the red dot hovering on Move’s forehead.
“This is for towing my RV last week,” Maynard said as he pulled the trigger.

What Went Wrong?
The inaccurate example commits a pile of blurry errors in record time.
The red dot sight is being confused with a laser sight. A laser sight projects a red dot onto a target, sort of like a laser pointer. A red dot sight displays a red dot inside a tube used for aiming and does not project onto a target.
However, neither piece of gear is appropriate for a sniper scenario. Maynard is perched a block away from his target. That’s out of range for a laser sight, which is only effective out to 20 yards or so. Maynard needs more than a red dot sight, too, since that type of device doesn’t magnify targets. Remember the rule of thumb to spare confusion: A scope magnifies a target; a sight does not.
Since this scene seems intent on using some sort of ruby-themed aiming device, a red dot scope is used in the corrected version. It’s identical to a red dot sight, except it sports a telescoping lens. It could magnify Maynard’s target a block away.
If this is confusing, another route is to treat weapons depictions like grammar snags and just write around them. Simplify Maynard’s setup by giving him a standard rifle scope. Then it’s as easy as having him line up the crosshairs as the motorcade approaches.
