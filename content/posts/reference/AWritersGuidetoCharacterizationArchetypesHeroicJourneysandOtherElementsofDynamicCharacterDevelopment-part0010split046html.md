A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
SPIRITUAL VS. MENTAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. These things go against her ordered, planned lifestyle so she is not a good candidate for helping him achieve success.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. He can help her get back to nature and to value herself, but she may not enjoy the way he goes about it. He can really push people to change. He can’t teach her much about letting go of her inhibitions.
The Father’s Daughter doesn’t have much time to build causes and missions as the Male Messiah does. She may not have the patience for it and may not respect his choice to spend his time on it. She’s used to office drama and business negotiations. She’s used to smart, logical, and strong men. She can either admire or disrespect the Male Messiah for his choices. She certainly won’t join him without a compelling reason.
He understands all of the intellectual jargon she uses but doesn’t understand why she values the ability to use such big words all the time. What is the point?
If he really likes her, he may start reading about the subjects that interest her so they can talk about them. If she really likes him, she’ll dabble in his tasks to try to understand him better. Still, they come from different worlds.
