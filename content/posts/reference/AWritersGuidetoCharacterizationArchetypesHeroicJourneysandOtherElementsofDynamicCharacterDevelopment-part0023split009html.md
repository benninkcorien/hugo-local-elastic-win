A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
Audiences are interested in seeing love relationships work out. They want to learn from what they see or read. Love is something we all strive for in life. We all want to experience a deep connection with another person.
As for all-American hero aspect of the eagle, audiences want to believe that someone out there is ready and willing to save the day. In real life, we rest easy knowing we can depend on police and firemen, if we should need them. We like that they are specially trained and always on their game. On the other hand, we also like stories in which those heroes are made more human so we can better relate to them. We want to know we can count on them but it makes a good story if they, too, have weaknesses they must overcome.
