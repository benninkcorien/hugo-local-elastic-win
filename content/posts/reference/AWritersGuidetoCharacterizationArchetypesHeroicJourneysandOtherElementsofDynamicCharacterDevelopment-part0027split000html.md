A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 21THE BUTTERFLYJOYFUL TRANSFORMATION
“The butterfly is a colorful, delightful symbol of transition and growth. People with the butterfly totem are joyful people who appear to others as bright and cheerful…Butterflies teach us that change is positive and should be embraced. Butterflies are born after a period of struggle. Without the struggle the wings would not be strong enough to allow the butterfly to take wing.” —Totemwisdom.com
I once sat at the beach and was visited by ladybugs and butterflies, a highly unusual occurrence for a beach in Los Angeles. The insects’ beauty and peace in particular impressed me. They just floated along on the breeze, landing on my leg for a moment before playing in the air once again. They were so in ‘flow.’
Unlike snakes, butterflies symbolize a more delicate transformation. They have a more divine quality to them. The hero’s transformation here could be about moving toward a very positive outcome, such as a lifelong dream or love. Whatever it is, the hero wants to go through the transformation. A good example is the god Angus in search of his beloved after a lifetime of conquests: “It was then that Angus saw he could never be with her in his human form. Only if he would transform with her, could he know her love fully.” There is something to gain and the hero wants to gain it.
Butterflies are sensitive, especially to the earth and the earth’s energy. If something bad happens ecologically speaking, insects and butterflies are the first to leave an area. They are sensitive in that way. The hero might possess this kind of skill as well. He may have an awareness or sensitivity, or an inner knowing, that maybe he didn’t have before or maybe he always had but didn’t use.
