A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE NURTURER
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. The Nurturer is not skilled at letting go of her doubts. Because she is very committed to healing others, she’s also not used to letting go of the outcome of events.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and find her own identity. These are things the Male Messiah can help her with because he knows how to remain unattached.
He is also so unpredictable that she can’t rely on him to be there for her all the time. There’s not much for her to attach to and depend on with him, so she may look to others for this attachment rather than standing alone.
They both share the need to help others, which may keep them together for a long time. She understands where he is coming from but she simply can’t let someone suffer for their higher good the way he can.
He understands why she rearranges her life to help others because he rearranges his life for his task or mission. They respect each other and can be great friends. He can be a very faithful husband.
