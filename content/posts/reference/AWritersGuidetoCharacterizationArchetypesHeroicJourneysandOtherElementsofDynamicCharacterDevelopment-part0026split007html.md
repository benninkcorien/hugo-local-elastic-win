A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can show this lesson with symbols of snakes, circular snakelike symbols, and things that are dark. You might convey a dark mood, dark tone, dark opinions, and a dark view of things. Loneliness, going away, and absence may work into the plot.
You can have characters that have been through similar situations and act as oracles for the hero. They might fill her in a bit on what is happening, what’s going to happen, and show her the way a little.
Nobody can do this transformation for the hero, but guides along the way may help her understand things and they can symbolize what the hero is going through.
