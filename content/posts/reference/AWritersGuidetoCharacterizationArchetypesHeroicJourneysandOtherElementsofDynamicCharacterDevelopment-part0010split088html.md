A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Seeing:
   •  How does the heroine look? The hero?
   •  How does the hero look to the heroine?
   •  Where are they?
   •  What does the setting look like?
   •  Does the heroine see something that distracts her from the hero? Does this bring up a good or bad memory for her?
   •  How is the lighting?
Describe love as if it were a color. Use a metaphor: “As blue as the ocean.”
