Forensics: A Guide for Writers
INTRODUCTION  
The popularity of television crime shows such as CSI, Bones, and Law & Order underscores the public’s interest in forensics. Why is forensic science suddenly so interesting? Is it some macabre fascination with death or with the criminal world? Or is it that people are curious by nature and have always had a strong appetite for scientific knowledge? In truth, our fascination with all things forensic is probably a combination of all these. Science and drama can be a powerful mix.
The world of forensic science has proven to be quite fascinating, even to the layman. We are intrigued when we hear of a new forensic technique or a legal triumph due to forensic evidence. Whether it’s extracting DNA from a single eyelash, a tear, or a centuries-old mummy, or solving a decades-old murder with a single partial fingerprint, we are glued to the TV to see how it was done.
Forensics is a huge field, encompassing the sciences of anatomy, histology, physiology, pharmacology, chemistry, physics, biology, bacteriology, entomology, anthropology, and psychology, to name a few. It is, of course, impossible to cover every aspect of forensics in this book. In fact, the subject matter covered in each chapter would require several textbooks to thoroughly explore. And the average reader would find such an in-depth exploration confusing and boring.
In this book, I’ve attempted to open the doors to the world of forensics and provide the reader with a broad understanding of forensic science as well as an in-depth understanding of the most commonly employed forensic techniques. The ones you see on TV, read in the paper, and, for the writer of fiction, the details you want for your stories. For many, this book will supply all the information you need to understand forensic science, both in the present and historically, while others will want to dig deeper. If you are in the latter group, I suggest you simply search in an Internet search engine such as Google (www.google.com) for any subject or name or word you want to explore and see where it takes you.
Above all, I hope this book informs and fascinates, and of course makes you think and ask questions. For the writers among you, I hope it not only gives you the knowledge you need to create a believable story but that it also stirs your creative juices and makes you explore areas of your story you never before considered.
