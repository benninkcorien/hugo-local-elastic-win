Book Title
A GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS
This book uses many specialized terms from a variety of fields. Some of them occur only once or twice and are defined when they're introduced; so if you don't find a word or phrase here, try the index. This glossary is intended to provide a ready reference for a few terms of special importance and frequent occurrence. Some of its definitions are of necessity approximate and not fully rigorous, so if you need to know exactly what a term means and how to work with it, you should consult a text in the appropriate field to acquire the necessary background.
One general observation on word use within this book: a number of terms, such as “Solar System,” “Sun” and “Moon,” can apply either to our Solar System and its components, or to their analogs in any other system of a star and its accompanying planets. To minimize confusion, I have tried to spell these words with capitals when they apply to our specific examples, and lowercase when the use is general. Thus, for example, “Sun” refers to our Sun, while “sun” means any star in its capacity as the source of heat and light for planets orbiting it. “Moon” is Earth's natural satellite, while “moon” means any satellite of any other planet (including those in our Solar System).
amino acid: Any of a large class of nitrogen-containing acids that are important constituents of organisms.
angular momentum: A property of rotating objects or systems, important because it is conserved (remains constant) when the system is not acted on by external forces (or, more precisely, torques). For a point mass m revolving at speed v in a circle of radius r, angular momentum = mvr. A more complicated system can be viewed as a collection of such masses and its total angular momentum computed by adding up all the separate angular momenta; however, complete specification of angular momentum involves both a magnitude and a direction—i.e., it is a vector. For details, see standard physics texts.
arctic zone: That part of a planet on which the sun is sometimes above or below the horizon for a day or more at a time. Arctic zones are centered on the poles and, on planets of moderate axial tilt, tend to have the lowest temperatures occurring on the planet. However, their most important characteristic is not cold, but large variations, both seasonal and daily, in daylight/night ratio and weather conditions. A planet with no axial tilt has no arctic zones, by this definition; one with 90° tilt is all arctic.
astronomical unit: A convenient unit for distances within a solar system, equal to the average radius (or, more properly, the semimajor axis) of Earth's orbit.
axial tilt: The angle by which a planet's axis of rotation is tilted from the perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.
binary star (also called double star): A pair of stars revolving around their common center of mass.
black hole: A “hole in space” resulting from the collapse of a massive old star to a radius so small that not even light can escape its gravity.
brown dwarf: A “borderline object,” or very massive planet or small and feeble star, heated by gravitational contraction and radioactive decay, but not enough to initiate thermonuclear fusion reactions.
carbohydrate: An important class of organic compounds including sugars and starches, made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
cell: A more or less self-contained, usually microscopic unit that is the basic building block of organisms, at least on Earth—i.e., each organism consists of one cell or an association of many.
center of mass: For astronomical purposes, the point about which the members of a system revolving under their mutual gravitational attraction revolve. For two equal masses, the CM. is midway between them. For unequal masses, it is closer to the larger mass. If one mass is much larger than the other, as in the case of the Sun and Earth, the common CM. is so close to the center of the larger mass that the smaller is often said, with approximate truth, to revolve around the larger.
centrifugal force: The apparent outward force felt by a revolving object. “Actually,” i.e., from the viewpoint of an outside observer, centrifugal force is an illusion caused by the tendency of any object to continue traveling in a straight line—which, for a revolving object, means fly off on a tangent—unless acted on by a force.
centripetal force: The force toward the center that must be applied to a moving object to bend its path into a circle. Note that the centripetal force is not a result of circular motion, but its cause. Thus the gravitational attraction of the Sun for the Earth is the centripetal force that keeps it in orbit.
chromosome: One of the threadlike bodies within a cell that carries genetic information.
conservation law: A physical law stating that a particular quantity characteristic of a system remains constant no matter what internal changes the system undergoes, as long as it is not subjected to external forces. Important conserved quantities include energy, momentum and angular momentum.
convergent evolution: The independent evolution of similar forms in different but similar environments.
COTI: Acronym for Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, the nucleic acid, structurally a double helix, in whose details genetic information is coded in all Earthly organisms.
echolocation: Locating and identifying objects by analyzing echos of sound waves directed toward them, as by bats, dolphins and human-built sonar equipment.
ecology: The interactions and relationships among organisms and between them and their environment. Also sometimes used to mean the system consisting of an environment and the interacting organisms that inhabit it, though a better term for that is ecosystem.
electromagnetic radiation: Waves consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, including X-rays, light and radio waves. All types travel at approximately 3 × 108 m/sec in vacuum. For other information on types and characteristics, see figure 3-1.
energy: A physical quantity, roughly defined as capacity to do work, important because it is conserved (remains constant) when a system is not acted on by external forces, and because it is a fundamental requirement of all organisms. Energy can take many forms and be converted from one form to others; for a fuller discussion, see standard textbooks on physics.
escape velocity: The minimum speed that an object launched from some object (such as the surface of a planet) must have to avoid being pulled back to the object by gravity. This definition applies to an object that, once launched, continues only by its own inertia; if it carries and uses a means of propulsion, such as a continuously operating engine, the concept of escape velocity does not apply.
ethology: The study of animal behavior.
eukaryote: A cell containing internal membranes, a well-defined nucleus and chromosomes, and other internal structures; characteristic of most Earthly organisms, including all multicellular forms.
evolution: Broadly, any process of changing form, such as the successive stages of development of an individual human being or star, or the development of new species of plants or animals from old ones. It is not equivalent to natural selection or “survival of the fittest,” and does not necessarily imply improvement.
extrapolation: Predicting a possible course of events on the basis of established theory by applying it in a region of experience where it has been well tested, or by assuming (which may or may not be true) that it will continue to act the same way in a region where it hasn't been tested.
FTL: Acronym for “faster than light.”
hydrocarbon: Any of a class of compounds consisting only of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH4).
insolation: The amount of energy per unit time per unit area reaching a planet or other object from its sun.
isomers: Molecules having the same chemical formula (i.e., the same numbers of the same kinds of atoms) but different physical structures.
isotopes: Atoms of the same elements but differing in atomic mass—i.e., having the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.
jet propulsion: See rocket propulsion.
lipid: A class of organic compounds including fats and oils.
magnitude: A logarithmic measure of the brightness of stars or other astronomical objects. Apparent magnitude measures apparent brightness, which depends on both intrinsic brightness and viewing distance; absolute magnitude measures intrinsic brightness. For details, see the sidebar.
mass: The amount of matter in an object.
momentum: A physical quantity that is conserved in a system not acted on by external forces, such as a rocket or a pair of colliding objects. Like angular momentum, linear momentum is a vector, so both magnitudes and directions must be considered in determining the total momentum of a system.
mutation: A change in genetic code, leading to an inheritable change in characteristics of an organism.
nanotechnology: A kind of technology, now in its infancy, in which macroscopic objects are built up atom by atom by submicroscopic “assemblers.”
nebula: A cloud of dust and gas, denser than the average interstellar medium.
neutron star: The last stage of evolution of some massive stars, in which the outer layers have been lost and the remaining core is so compressed by gravity that it consists mostly of neutrons.
nova: An explosion causing a dramatic temporary increase in the brightness of a star; not as drastic as a supernova (q.v.), and some stars undergo more than one nova during their lives.
nucleic acid: Any of a class of organic acids important in biochemical processes.
oxidation: The chemical process of moving electrons from an atom or molecule, making it electrically more positive; so-called because oxygen is one of the most common and important oxidizing agents (but not the only one). Since electrons moved from one atom or molecule are moved to another, a chemical reaction that involves oxidation of one substance necessarily involves reduction (q.v.) of another.
parasitism: A relationship between two organisms in which one lives on, and at the expense of, the other.
pheromone: A chemical released by an animal to stimulate a particular kind of behavior in other individuals of the same species.
plate tectonics: A geological theory explaining many of Earth's properties in terms of its surface consisting of several plates floating on a softer mantle and interacting frictionally at the edges.
primary: The largest and dominant member of a system of bodies moving under their mutual gravitational attraction; e.g., the Sun is the primary of the Solar System and Earth the primary of the Earth-Moon system.
prokaryote: A primitive type of cell containing no internal membranes, nucleus or well-defined chromosomes; characteristic of Earthly bacteria and blue-green algae.
protein: Any of a large class of complex combinations of amino acids, which are important constituents of all organisms on Earth.
psi phenomena: Phenomena such as telepathy, telekinesis and clairvoyance, whose existence is suggested by anecdotal evidence but not generally accepted or explained by conventional science; also called paranormal or parapsychological phenomena.
punctuated equilibrium: A kind of evolution consisting mainly of periods of relative stability, with major changes occurring rapidly and only in response to abrupt and major environmental changes.
quantum mechanics: A form of physics developed in the twentieth century in which both matter and radiation exhibit properties of both particles and waves, and many physical quantities can have only certain discrete values.
recombinant DNA: DNA made in the laboratory by combining DNA from organisms of different species.
reduction: The chemical process of moving electrons to an atom or molecule, making it electrically less positive; one common and important reducing agent is hydrogen. Since electrons moved from one atom or molecule are moved to another, a chemical reaction that involves reduction of one substance necessarily involves oxidation (q.v.) of another.
relativity: A theory developed by Albert Einstein and others in which the speed of light is a universal constant but measurements of space and time depend on the observer.
rocket propulsion: A type of propulsion in which a body is accelerated in one direction by ejecting mass in the opposite direction. In rocket engines, the ejected mass is produced by combustion in a closed chamber into which fuel and an oxidizing agent, both carried on board, are introduced. Jet engines are similar but obtain their oxidant en route by taking air in through the front end.
SETI: Acronym for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
sonar: Originally an acronym for Sound Navigation Ranging, referring to equipment for underwater echolocation. By extension, any kind of echolocation, whether done in water or by another medium and by machinery or organisms.
spectroscopy: Analysis of sources or absorbers of electromagnetic radiation (such as stars or planetary atmospheres) by separating the light (or other radiation) into its component wavelengths.
stereoisomers: Isomers (q.v.) that are mirror images of each other.
supernova: An extremely violent explosion causing the destruction of certain massive stars. The radiation produced would be a threat to life around nearby stars, but supernovae are also important as a source of heavy elements for forming new stars and planets.
surface gravity: The acceleration caused by gravity at the surface of a planet or other body. Often measured in units of g or gees, the acceleration of gravity at the surface of Earth.
symbiosis: A relationship in which two or more organisms of different types are closely associated and derive mutual benefit.
synchronous rotation: A situation in which a satellite or planet's period of rotation has a simple, stable relationship to its period of revolution around its primary. A body orbiting close to its primary tends to become locked into such a relationship as a result of tidal distortion and braking. Unless otherwise specified, the term usually means the periods of rotation and revolution are equal, as in the case of our Moon, which therefore always has the same side facing Earth. However, a similar type of stability can occur with the period of rotation exactly % that of revolution, as in the case of Mercury in its orbit around the Sun.
temperate zone: A band of latitudes on a planet in which the sun never rises directly overhead or remains above or below the horizon for as long as a full day. On Earth, or any planet with less than 45 tilt, the temperate zones lie between the tropics and arctic zones in each hemisphere.
terraforming: Changing conditions on a planet to resemble those on Earth; by extension, sometimes used to mean artificial modification of any planet to any desired specifications.
tidal forces: Apparent forces caused by the gravitational force on one part of a body being stronger than that on another part; named for their most familiar manifestation, the ocean tides on Earth, which are caused by the Sun and Moon pulling more strongly on the near side than on the far side.
time dilation: A relativistic effect in which travelers moving close to the speed of light experience less passage of time than their stay-at-home counterparts.
time-binding: The transmission of learned information from one generation to later generations.
tropics: That part of a planet on which the sun sometimes rises high enough to pass directly overhead. Arctic zones are centered on the equator and, on planets of moderate axial tilt, tend to have the highest temperatures occurring on the planet. However, their most important characteristic is not heat, but lack of variation, both seasonal and daily, in daylight/night ratio and weather conditions. A planet with no axial tilt is entirely tropical, by this definition; one with 90° tilt has no tropical zones.
virtual reality: An extremely convincing illusion of reality created by a computer.
virus: A submicroscopic infective agent variously regarded as the smallest and most primitive kind of organism, or an extremely complicated molecule showing some but not all of the properties of life.
