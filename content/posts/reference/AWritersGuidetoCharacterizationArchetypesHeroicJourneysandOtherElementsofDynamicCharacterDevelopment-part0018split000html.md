A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 12THE DOLPHINTRANSCENDENCE, HARMONY & PURPOSE
“Dolphins teach us how to play and open up to joyful experiences in our daily lives. Dolphins often appear when a person is swallowed up with their work as a reminder that everyone needs to take a day off now and again to play. They also teach love of self. Blow-out your blowhole and breathe in some new life. You’ll feel better.” —Phylameana Desy
I’ve had many interactions with dolphins recently, and they have been quite amazing. My time on a dolphin safari was especially memorable. I was in a boat surrounded by hundreds of dolphins, including babies. They are so playful and beautiful to see in their wild habitat. I petted a dolphin at Sea World once, and it too was a wonderful experience, but not as great as seeing these great creatures in their own environment, enjoying life in a pod.
Dolphins can never fall asleep completely. Half of a dolphin’s brain has to be working at all times so the dolphin continues to breathe. One half of the dolphin’s brain will go into a delta sleep state, while the other half remains awake. This delta sleep state is considered the highest level of consciousness, which great masters try to obtain through meditation
The dolphin’s lesson is to transcend, harmonize, and find purpose in life. Dolphins create groups and communicate in such a way that whatever one dolphin sees, they all see. A sense of individuality is important, too, but they are so connected as a group and care so deeply about each other that they exist in a state of constant communication. I’m not sure if such a thing occurs in other animal groups. Dolphins constantly walk two worlds at once—they have two halves to their brain, which can think individually, and they need both to live in water and breathe air to survive.
As symbols, dolphins teach about becoming a more enlightened person, who reaches his full potential. In this case, full potential means the highest level one can aspire to (especially on a spiritual level). That’s the biggest part of the lesson of the dolphin.
