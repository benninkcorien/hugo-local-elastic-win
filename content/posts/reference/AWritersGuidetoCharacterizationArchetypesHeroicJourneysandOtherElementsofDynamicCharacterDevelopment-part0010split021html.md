A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE AMAZON
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. The Amazon can teach him how to rely on and develop his body, though not in the sensual ways the Seductive Muse teaches.
The Amazon wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The Recluse completely understands this desire and may help her with it. He has always needed a home base that allows him privacy and solace.
If she ever gets intense, he won’t respond to it. He will always try to remain calm and unattached or sarcastic and flighty. Either way he won’t be sucked into her latest cause.
The Amazon is fine with a man who keeps to himself. She doesn’t want to be obligated to go out for a night on the town or to make plans. She has more important things to do. Her causes keep her busy most of the time, though she is known for letting her hair down and enjoying herself.
The Recluse may not know how to act around the Amazon because he’s so used to either being alone or dealing with needy people. She lets him be alone when he needs it and this is refreshing for him.
She likes her own space too and he’s low maintenance in that vein. If she wants to go on a woman’s camping trip for a week, he says no problem.
