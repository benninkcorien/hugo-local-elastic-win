AUTHOR'S NOTE
Â AUTHOR'S NOTEThe laws of our country and its states, counties, cities, towns, and villages vary greatly, with each police department in the country operating under a different set of rules and regulations. To include each of those laws and regulations in a book would be an impossible task. The material contained within the pages of this book is, for the most part, standard. For information about the laws and rules in your individual areas, please contact your local courts or police departments.The names and places used in the legal documents and within the anecdotal portions of this book are fictional, a product of my imagination. In no way are they intended to portray any person, living or dead. The events, however, are real.
