A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE NURTURER
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. Being the Caretaker that she is, the Nurturer can help him with this. She will try to be understanding and give him the patience that he needs.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and find her own identity. These are things the Recluse can help her with because he likes being alone himself. He won’t like having their home filled with people all the time, however, and will keep her Nurturing in check by limiting visits from outsiders.
The Nurturer would be a great match for a Recluse who is afraid to be with others. She will always have people coming around, and the Recluse will never be lonely again. Deep down inside he may like this but won’t admit it.
If he ever comes between her and those she cares about (or cares for), the tears will fall and he will feel guilty.
