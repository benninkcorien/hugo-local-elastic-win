VIVID DESCRIPTIONS
VIVID DESCRIPTIONS
Quote: “...setting is more than a mere backdrop for action; it is an interactive aspect of your fictional world that saturates the story with mood, meaning, and thematic connotations.” —veteran writing instructor, Jessica Morrell
I strongly recommend that writers briefly describe the setting at the beginning of each new scene or chapter to help the reader get a visual of the location. Also, writers should include a few vital details about the location by lacing the description throughout the dialogue and action to remind the reader where the scene takes place.
This excerpt should help writers get a clear idea on how to write a descriptive scene using the five senses (sensory details), action, dialogue, and Deep POV. And whenever you can describe something, try to see if it can be revised more effectively through the character actions, like in the example below from my paranormal romance novel, IMMORTAL ECLIPSE.
Please study this example…
DEEP POV:
As we finish touring the second wing, Mrs. Pratt finally opens a door to the left and switches on the light, illuminating a quaint bedroom. It’s richly furnished and decorated in a startling, opulent blue softened by the flowered wallpaper.
The fireplace is flanked by a duo of overstuffed armchairs. Heavy damask curtains tied open with braided tassels cover the bay window that has a cushioned window seat. The huge bed looks soft and warm. With my gaze lingering on the stack of decorative pillows, I almost trip over my luggage and the boxes already placed beside it. My fingers trace the plush velvet comforter; I’ll enjoy reading by the fire or snuggled in the bed on cold winter nights. The huge walk-in closet is, hands-down, the best feature of the room.
“This is the Blue Room. It has a private bathroom,” she said.
“The Blue Room, huh? Wonder why they call it that?” A giggle erupts. Mrs. Pratt clucks her tongue, so I flatten my lips to stifle the laughter.
I wouldn’t ordinarily choose blue, yet the color seems calming, like an antidote to the strange feelings I’ve been experiencing since arriving at Summerwind.
She moves to the door. “We thought it would be better if you were close to the staff’s quarters in this wing. On the other side of the house, otherwise there’d be no one around to hear you scream in the darkness. At night...” She frowns and looks away.
I stare at her. As if that doesn’t sound ominous.

Could you grasp how the scene from my novel is vivid and inciting? It lures the reader into the scene with a mixture of description, action, dialogue, and “voice.”
Now these longer scenes below are both very different. The first is shallow and bland, with too much telling and gives readers a weak visual
Please examine these examples…
SHALLOW:
I went into my father’s vast bedroom that had been decorated in an historical style, and I saw a gold mirror over the headboard of the really big bed, and then I noticed a black and golden colored comforter. There was some red curtains hung in the windows. The walls were adorned with flowery wallpaper and there were some pictures of our family’s home in the Hamptons.
Then I smelled my mother’s perfume, but I realized it was just coming from the flowers that were placed in the room. I knew that my mother would have hated all the money wasted on this room. There was an expensive Persian rug bought for my father’s new wife for their wedding anniversary on the floor.
I noticed there was a big screen TV on the far wall and it was the only contemporary exclusion to the bedroom’s antique furnishings.
That shallow scene is boring, passive, and just states the facts. But this second Deeper POV scene has “voice” and action and stays in close-and-personal.
DEEP POV (sensory details):
Sighing heavily, I hesitated in the doorway of my father’s gaudily redecorated suite. I rolled my eyes as I took in the vast bedroom decorated in the style of Louis XVI, with a gilt-framed mirror hanging over the headboard of the king-sized, black-and-gold-upholstered bed.
Is he for real? 
I stepped inside, my fingers lightly trailing along the flowered wallpaper, and paused to study the photos of the family’s beach house in the Hamptons. At least my father hadn’t removed those…
When I turned, my shoulder brushed against the red velvet curtains covering the windows. When the fragrance of lilacs drifted over from the flower arrangement on the dresser, my heart stuttered. The scent reminded me of my dearly departed mother. And she would be turning over in her grave at all the money my father had wasted on this luxurious room.
I shook my head when I caught sight of the Persian rug bought at auction from Sotheby’s as a gift to my father’s gold-digging third wife for their fifth wedding anniversary.
Glancing upward at the wall, I grunted at the lone modern exception to the room’s historical décor—a fifty-inch plasma TV.

Now ask yourself: which example caused more impact?
Words and phrases with powerful sensory connotations always increase the chances of producing an empathic response in the reader. Some things to continuously consider whenever you’re revising the setting:
Do the word choices paint vivid images in the reader’s mind? 
Do the descriptions place the reader in the scene? 
Do they make the reader an active participant in the story instead of a mere observer?
It’s easy for writers in early drafts to depend on simple, straightforward descriptions of rooms and settings. Using Deep POV does add more words to your scenes, but the experience you’ll give your readers will be well worth it.
