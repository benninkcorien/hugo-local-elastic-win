A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
Audiences like to watch a character go for the goal. The hero here is driving and motivating himself because he wants to change. Even if someone else initially pushed him, at some point he gets on board with it. There is courage in that and sometimes there is a little bit of madness in it as well. It’s interesting to watch the hero arrive at a thin line between courage and madness, and try to work it out.
