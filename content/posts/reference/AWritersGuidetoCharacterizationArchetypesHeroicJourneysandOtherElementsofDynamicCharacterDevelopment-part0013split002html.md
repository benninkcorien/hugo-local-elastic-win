A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Rain Man
The materialistic Tom Cruise character initially kidnaps his brother from a facility and holds him for ransom, which is half the inheritance his father left solely to his unknown brother, Dustin Hoffman. As Cruise learns to love his brother, he decides that his brother is more important to him than the money he demanded. Every step of the way he must learn to have patience with his brother.
King Lear
Once Lear is driven to the end of his rope, he cries out at the cruelties of Goneril and Regan. “You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!” King Lear cannot approach his situation or obtain his goal without learning how to have patience. As you can see, this is not the plot but part of the theme.
This lesson works very well with the Mystery genre too. The hero needs to take time to reflect and consider facts and behavior in order to get the big picture and solve the mystery.
