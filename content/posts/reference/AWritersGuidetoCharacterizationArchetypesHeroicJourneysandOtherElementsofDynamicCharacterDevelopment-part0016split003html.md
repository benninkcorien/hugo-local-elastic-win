A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR CHARACTER RESIST THIS LESSON
The heroine may resist her foolish, playful side because she is afraid of what might happen if she drops her serious side. Will her house of cards crumble?
Deep inside she may be a fun extrovert, but she is afraid if she lets go and does something foolish, something horrible may happen. She’s afraid she will not be able to get back to the responsible person she was. If she loosens up and lets her guard down, she may experience too much of a release. For some people, it’s really hard to let loose.
Some people try to spice up their lives in little ways. They test the water with something small and may leave it at that. But other characters can’t do even that much. Their idea of crazy may be to let the pictures fall to one side without setting them right again. Think of the character Niles in Frasier.
If the hero jumps in, she will have fun. She will experience a renewal and invite energy into her life.
I often tell people, writers especially, to go out and have an adventure. That is the best way to get over writer’s block. Completely distracting your mind with fun and laughter allows a refreshed energy into your life. A bit of fear may come with the responsibility of this new energy, as well as the shift in life that occurs when one lets go.
Perhaps a character’s doctor tells him that he has to stop being so angry and negative and depressed. His doctor suggests: “Write down your thoughts and see how many negative ones you are having about every little thing that happens. Then you will see that you are stressing yourself out. It’s bad for your heart and it’s bad for your soul.”
