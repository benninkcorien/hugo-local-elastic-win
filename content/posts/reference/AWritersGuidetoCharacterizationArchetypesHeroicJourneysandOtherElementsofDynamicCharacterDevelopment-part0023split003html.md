A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
It’s scary to be vulnerable, and often a character doesn’t know the first thing about how to relate to others. Social skills are not taught at school. Students simply fumble through them as they pass from kindergarten to high school. A lot can happen during those formative years that leads to an aversion to letting people into your life in a deep and meaningful way. The hero may have experienced many instances as a kid that scared him away from getting emotionally close to others. He may seem like he wants desperately to be close to someone, but then he sabotages himself without realizing he is to blame for his own situation. He has little clarity about this aspect of himself.
As the all-American hero, he might start out having the things he thinks he needs to accomplish his goal, but actually he does not want to face the fact that he may have lost his edge or some of his skills. This might be due to injury, circumstance, aging, or something that happened to a loved one. He’s a little off his game in some ways, but he does not want to acknowledge it. He’s not sure he can live up to the expectations that everyone has of him anymore.
