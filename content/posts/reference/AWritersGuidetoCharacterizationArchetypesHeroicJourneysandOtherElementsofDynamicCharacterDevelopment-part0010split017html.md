A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE MYSTIC
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and an AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. Teaching others how to control themselves is the Mystic’s specialty. She won’t respond to his intensity. She will always try to remain calm and unattached or sarcastic and flighty. Either way she won’t accept his drama and that puzzles him.
She needs to learn to assert herself and to go out and experience life. As a strong man, the Protector can teach her to be assertive, but he will still want to look out for her and to protect her. Her nonviolent attitude allows him to do this.
He may be in awe of her spiritual and paranormal abilities, and he may even try to learn about them in detail. Maybe he can have the same experiences?
He’s so physically focused that he may have a hard time believing in the unknown and things that are unseen. She respects a man who knows what he wants in life, however, the Protector is usually better at knowing what he doesn’t want.
