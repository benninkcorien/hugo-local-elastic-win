A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE AMAZON
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. The Amazon can help him with these needs if she believes in what he is doing. She knows well how to trust that her work will get done; that is, that fighting for her causes will bring victory. She can’t worry about outcomes when she knows things will work themselves out. She can trust others to do their jobs well, and she knows how to motivate them.
She wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The Male Messiah may recognize her contributions, but he can’t help her much in building a place of her own. He has other things on his mind.
They can both get behind a cause or task and work together for hours on end. They are like best friends most of the time. They understand how the other one thinks and feels. They understand commitment and perseverance.
She can help him by literally protecting him. She has the resources to do it.
If he needs to leave her, she will be okay with that. She can take care of herself and make it on her own. The Male Messiah needs a woman like that because he may leave or make sacrifices at any time.
