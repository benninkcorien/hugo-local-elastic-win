A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
How would you show this? You could have a very natural, instinctual, safari kind of setting. Conversely props and costumes can be very sharp and calculated, and everything must have a reason for being there. Nothing is superfluous or flamboyant; think very structured, useful, and practical. The setting, props, and costuming all have that same mood, tone, and theme. A sense of sharpness prevails.
Time can be an element in this story. It’s the usual passing time but in a way that is assertive and powerful and almost corporate.
