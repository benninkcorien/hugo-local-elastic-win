A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and the AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Matriarch. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. She can help him do both, but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. He is so against structure and planning that he can definitely help her with this. He may not be sure if he believes the same things she believes, but that doesn’t matter to him. ‘To each his own,’ he says. If he’s willing to suspend his disbelief, he can be an asset because he can help her go with the flow of events.
She sometimes becomes lost in her cause. He can teach her to get in touch with her physical senses and to see what the big deal is about being ‘alive,’ and to see why she shouldn’t waste her lifetime ignoring her desires.
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. This is just fine for the Woman’s Man. He loves moving around and meeting new people. He won’t leave her as readily as other men might.
