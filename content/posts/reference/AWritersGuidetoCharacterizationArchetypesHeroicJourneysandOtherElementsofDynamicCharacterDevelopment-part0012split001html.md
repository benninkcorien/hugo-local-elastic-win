A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHAT IS A CHARACTER LESSON AND ARC?
In the writing of your novel or story, you want your character to go on some kind of journey, and during the journey, you want a subtle thematic message to emerge. (The masculine and feminine journeys we touched on in Part I are the focus of 45 Master Characters. If you have read that book, I want you to know that yes, you can use these archetypal lessons with those journeys.) The ultimate arc in life is the one that leads to self-actualization. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is the result of realizing one’s full potential as a human being and fulfilling a higher purpose. A great story puts a hero on a journey that contains a thematic lesson.
