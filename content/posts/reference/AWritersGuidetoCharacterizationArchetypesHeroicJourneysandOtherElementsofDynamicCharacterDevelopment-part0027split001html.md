A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE BUTTERFLY’S CHARACTER ARC
This lesson brings about a total and complete transformation, more so than the snake does, because the butterfly begins life crawling on the ground and ends it flying in the air with beautiful wings. Everything about the butterfly has transformed in every way possible and those changes can be viewed from the outside. At the same time, it was a quiet change that occurred inside a comfortable cocoon that the butterfly built and willingly entered.
This is a transformation of joy and gentleness, and it is not traumatic. Instead, it is an example of divine grace, where something big happens but a lot of the work is done for the character. This is an experience that the hero chose to have and enter into. This can be seen a lot in spiritual areas of life where little things can be seen by the hero as the big hand of the divine helping him and then all of a sudden something happens that changes him for the better.
He can:
   •  Be healed
   •  Have his whole outlook changed
   •  Find a new path is laid out before him
   •  Be offered the help he needs
   •  Overhear a conversation about the exact information he need.
You want to be careful you don’t use the ‘hand of god’ (known as deus ex machina) writing technique in which something completely implausible falls out of the sky to save the day. The hero must take an active role in pursuing something and helping to create the situations that allow for the divine assistance to come in.
The lesson is not something that’s pushed on him per se. The butterfly creates its own cocoon and has a lot of control over the situation. So the transformation occurs when the hero allows nature to take over. Think of motherhood and the transformation that women’s bodies go through and how their life is completely changed afterwards.
Joy, love, and gentleness are part of this kind of change. The hero can see how wonderful life after the change could be. It’s a change that the hero wants to go through and does so willingly.
