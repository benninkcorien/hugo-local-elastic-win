SHALLOW: COLDNESS
SHALLOW: COLDNESS
Quote: “Personality plays a large role in how a characters sounds. Their voice will reflect that personality and color every line of dialog and internal thought.” —author and blogger, Janice Hardy
If a writer tells the reader that a character is cold or it was a cold day, it is considered shallower writing. Writers should find innovative ways to show through Deeper POV instead.
Everything a writer needs to set the scene and vividly describe a location or feeling for the reader can be accomplished by using sensory details. As a writer revises a scene, it is effective to imagine themselves in the actual location, then think about the details. What is the character seeing, smelling, hearing, and touching? Using the five senses is mandatory when a writer wants to put a clear, descriptive visual into the reader’s mind.
Coldness in a character usually indicates a decrease in body temperature, or fear, or even an illness. And it can be used to describe the weather or how an object feels to the touch, but writers should illustrate it in a vibrant way that a reader will easily be able to imagine.
To revise any shallower writing, I would look for phrases such as, he felt cold or I could feel the cold or it was a cold day.
Some physical signs of coldness might be:
Trembling legs
Hugging one’s body
Quivering lips
Blue skin
Teeth chattering
Chills shake body
Runny nose
Numb fingers or toes
Shivering body
Stuttering dialogue
Examples of cold weather for settings:
Frost on the windows
Howling winds
Birds flying south
Heavy fog
Overcast skies
Spiders spinning larger than usual webs
Ice on the ground
Icicles hanging from roof
Slick roads
Harsh rains
Bare trees
Somber clouds
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: When I went outside, I felt very cold today. I put on a jacket against the wind.
DEEP POV: The second I stepped out of the house, an icy wind slapped my bare skin. Shivering, I yanked on my wool coat and stuffed my hands into warm gloves.
SHALLOW: Liam was freezing while he worked outside. His hands felt cold as he shoveled the snow out of driveway. He wished he had put on mittens.
DEEP POV: Liam’s fingers felt numb and his nose ran. He shoveled another heap of snow from the driveway and cursed at himself for forgetting to wear mittens.
SHALLOW: It was cold in the classroom and the heater was broken.
DEEP POV: Thick frost clung to the windows of the classroom, and my legs trembled. If the teacher didn’t get that heater fixed soon, I was coming to school in skiing gear!
SHALLOW:  Even though Emma wore a jacket, the weather felt really cold.
DEEP POV: Huddling inside her warm jacket, Emma’s breath made little white puffs in the frosty air.
SHALLOW: The weather in October is extremely cold and it makes me shiver.
DEEP POV: My teeth are chattering, and I shove my hands deep into my pockets against the chilly October weather.
SHALLOW: Mason opened the door of the spaceship and some very frosty air came out. He felt cold and shivered.
DEEP POV: An arctic gust escaped the pod when Mason opened the door of the spaceship. He shivered and pulled up the collar of his coat, and then rubbed his hands together to get warmer.
SHALLOW: It was a cold, overcast day at the campsite.
DEEP POV: The wintry morning sent a glacial coldness around the camp.
Here are a few longer scenes on how to use Deep POV to describe the cold. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the shallower writing, but see if you can clearly identify it now that you’re more aware of showing vs. telling.)
Please study and compare these examples…
SHALLOW: It had heavily snowed last night, and I need to walk with slow steps on the sidewalk so I don’t fall down. I feel really cold. I notice the cars, houses, and street have lots of new snow on them.
DEEP POV: Outside everything is white. The world resembles a frozen wasteland with a fresh blanket of snow covering the street from last night’s blizzard. I move slowly along the icy sidewalks, wrapping my arms around my torso to stay warm. Even the snow-bound cars seem abandoned today.
Please study and compare these examples…
SHALLOW: I built a snowman and then put a hat on its head. It started snowing and the cold made my lips feel numb.
DEEP POV: When I’d finished building my awesome snowman, I put a black hat on his white round head and smiled. A fresh swirl of powdery snowflakes danced in the intermittent gusts, and I caught sight of my quivering, blue lips in the window.
Please study and compare these examples…
SHALLOW: The air-conditioner was set to high and Olivia did not know how to turn it off. She felt cold and shaky. Her hands were the coldest part of her body.
DEEP POV: Olivia licked her dry, cracked lips and blew into her cupped hands for warmth. The air-conditioner was blasting in her office and she wasn’t sure how to turn the dang thing off!

Here is a longer, more detailed scene showing that a character feels cold and it also describes the setting. Please closely examine this scene to get a clear indication on how to describe the cold weather and the feeling of being cold.
DEEP POV: 
The burning sensation spreading on the bare skin of his arms and legs, along with his face and neck had started to get worse. Despite its angelic appearance, the icy sleet felt as though Ethan was being stabbed with thousands of sharp needles.
“I never should’ve told Amy that I wanted to see other people on her birthday,” he mumbled.
It was shortly after that ill-timed statement that his girlfriend had jumped into the car and sped off. She’d left him outside of town without a jacket (he’d given it to her to wear), gloves, or a cell phone, when they’d stopped to make a snowman.
Yeah, she was 100% pissed off, and now because of his big mouth, he was going to freeze to death.
He sighed. He had to make it home before nightfall.
Ethan stomped in sodden boots through the knee-deep drifts, hugging himself against the subzero winds. The snow was falling incessantly and blurred the hills and rooftops in the valley below. He flexed his hands and swiped at his runny nose with stiff fingers.
The fluffy snowflakes drifting downward would make a pretty Christmas card, but the cold seemed to penetrate his flesh and pierce the very marrow of his bones.
Ethan shivered uncontrollably and his body was shaken with a wheezing cough. He searched the surrounding area with teary eyes for some trace of shelter to stay the night. But there wasn’t a building in sight.
Just great. I’ll look like a snowman myself by morning.
With each lumbering step, his toes tingled with pain, and the soft crunch of snow beneath his boots echoed in the dying light. The roads were icy and his feet slipped on the slick surface. Ethan stumbled down the hill toward the city lights blinking like a rescue beacon in the distance.
After drudging for miles, he fell to his knees in exhaustion. The snow steadily enveloped him in a powdery white blanket that would surely cover his frozen corpse.

These examples should spark your creative muse. And if you use the Deep POV technique to describe the cold, then I can guarantee your readers will notice an amazing difference in your stories.
