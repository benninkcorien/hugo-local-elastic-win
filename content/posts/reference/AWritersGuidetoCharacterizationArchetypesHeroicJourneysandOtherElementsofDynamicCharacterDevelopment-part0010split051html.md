A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE MAIDEN
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. These are things the Maiden is great at. She is very spontaneous, adventurous, and trusting.
She must learn to stand on her own two feet. This will happen with the Male Messiah because she won’t be top priority in his life. He will be off pursuing his tasks and most likely traveling distances away from her. This will push her to stand on her own two feet, as she will be alone most of the time and will have to figure out who she is and what her interests are.
Since he’s not around much, he’s fine with whatever she wants to do with her day. This is the kind of freedom she wants.
The Male Messiah can see her and her ways as a distraction. But she can also give him a lot of energy, strength, and confidence. She may be too innocent for him. He may not be able to talk to her about his day because he doesn’t know if she can handle hearing about it. She is very sensitive and may be empathic.
