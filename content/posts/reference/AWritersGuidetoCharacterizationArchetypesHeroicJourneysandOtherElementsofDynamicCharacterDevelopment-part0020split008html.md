A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
There is no gender or cultural issue to play with here. You might show people in occupations typically considered very controlled and rigid acting more like free spirits. It is a very interesting lesson to learn about how you are, how you operate in the world, and how that affects the people around you.
The nature of this lesson makes for an interesting character-driven story. The energy this character puts out and how that energy affects everything in his life—his decisions, his choices, his thoughts, the friends, family, and helpers that he draws in or pushes away—drives the plot forward. The character must at all times be conscious of how he is behaving in order for him to reach his goal. (In Braveheart, for instance, William Wallace needed to inspire a lot of people and motivate them to risk their lives.) The hero needs to discover his free spirit and the freedom in his life in order to move forward. A lot of things may be keeping him from that freedom and therefore he is unable to move forward.
He’s trying so hard to control everything that he won’t listen to those who want to work with him and want to be there for him. This kind of energy can turn people off and push them away. Perhaps the story is about a family. A mom, who is so overbearing that she’s pushing her kids away, learns how to allow the children the freedom they deserve and in turn brings the family back together.
