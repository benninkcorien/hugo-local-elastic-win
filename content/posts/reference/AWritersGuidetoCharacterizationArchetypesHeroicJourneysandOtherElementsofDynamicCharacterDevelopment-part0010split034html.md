A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and the AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings, and she can help him with this but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. He is so used to letting go of outcomes that he can be a great teacher for her. He doesn’t care if he believes in her mission or not, he can have a great time following her on her tasks. He can be an asset if he’s willing to suspend his disbelief because he can help her take the risks she needs to take.
He can be a drawback if he refuses to take her seriously, or to believe in her, and shows it in his actions and words. He can cause her to hold on tighter to the outcome of her tasks if he pushes her too much. She may try to prove him wrong. He may not be serious enough for her taste though she enjoys being around happy people.
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. This fits well with the Fool, who finds work and structure boring. She always has a new agenda or cause to work for.
