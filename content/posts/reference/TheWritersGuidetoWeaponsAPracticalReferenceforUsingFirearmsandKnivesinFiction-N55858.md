Shotgun Ammunition, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Shotgun Ammunition
Shotgun ammunition is most often called shells, but rounds or cartridges are also appropriate. Bullets is not. To get more specific, shotshells and slugs refer to the two types of shotgun ammunition explained in this section.
Popular shotgun ammunition brands: Federal, Hornady, Remington, Winchester
Shotshells
Anatomy of shotgun ammunition. Both lead and steel shot variations are shown, although the former is most popular. Steel or other nontoxic shot is normally required by law for use in hunting over or near water. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
When people think of shotgun ammunition, they usually think of shotshells. Shotshells contain shot, also called BBs. Shot is more technically accurate than BBs, but this guide will use the term BBs for simplicity’s sake.
A number denotes the size of the BBs in the shotshell. The smaller the number, the larger the BBs. For example, 3 shot contains larger BBs than 6 shot. 00 shot has even larger BBs and goes by the nickname buckshot. That’s why novelists often use buckshot to really mess up characters.
The cloud of BBs that exits the barrel is called a pattern. Patterns are usually described as wide (the BBs are spread out), tight (the BBs are close together), or some variable along those lines. The farther the pattern travels, the more the BBs move away from each other. A typical maximum shotshell range is 50 yards. Beyond that, the pattern becomes unreliable.
A shooter can tweak the pattern using a choke. A choke is a replaceable, legal modification inserted into the end of the barrel. It makes the pattern wider or tighter. A permanent jug choke could also be carved out of the inside of the barrel.
When an exceptionally wide pattern is needed at close ranges, such as one able to cover the width of a person, a character might “saw off” the barrel of the shotgun (as mentioned earlier). Doing this significantly widens the pattern as the BBs exit the barrel, but as already noted, it’s also illegal.
Fiction writers sometimes use the term magnum to describe ammunition. A magnum shotshell contains more gunpowder and BBs. It’s usually longer, too. Some shotguns won’t take magnums (or longer shells in general) because they mechanically won’t fit.
Smaller BBs won’t likely pass through a character who’s been shot—they’ll stay inside the character. A single small BB doesn’t pack much punch, since the kinetic energy of the shotgun blast is dispersed over many small projectiles. But this doesn’t mean smaller BBs in a group are weak. Characters shot at close range may die with a direct hit.
Buckshot, the larger type of BBs, might pass through a character who’s been shot at close range. Its size means a hit from a single BB could cause serious injury. However, because the BBs are larger, there are fewer of them in a shotshell.
Advantages
Shotshells are among the most commonly sold ammunition in the world because of their use in hunting, shooting sports, and defense.
Spot-on accuracy isn’t as important when using shotshells. Scopes are generally not used in tandem with this ammunition.
Shotshells are usually tailored to specific purposes. For example, there are shotshells for hunting birds, for defense, and for shooting near water (these use nontoxic BBs instead of lead). As its name implies, buckshot is designed for large game, such as deer. Thrillers and crime fiction correctly use buckshot as a choice for killing characters, although any shotshell can be lethal.
Fewer restrictions exist for purchasing shotshells over the counter compared to other ammunition.
A character firing any shotshell at close range will inflict severe damage on the target. Guaranteed.
Disadvantages
Characters may have a difficult time obtaining buckshot. In some areas, it’s prohibited. Compare fictional settings with their real-world counterparts and check out local laws.
For targets more than 50 yards away, characters would have a difficult time shooting effectively; the pattern would spread out too much. It’d be better to give that character a rifle.
As with most ammunition, shotshells are not interchangeable between gauges or calibers. A 12-gauge shotshell is too large to fit into a 20-gauge shotgun. Likewise a 20-gauge shotshell may fit into a 12-gauge shotgun, but it won’t fire. In fact, it may slip down the barrel and become jammed. Therefore, characters using a 12-gauge shotgun should not use 20-gauge shotshells. Sounds obvious, but it happens in the real world.
Just because accuracy isn’t as important doesn’t mean characters don’t need to aim. Making a hit still requires experience. A complicated shot will still be out of reach for inexperienced characters.
Inaccurate Example
Bill Robber hauled the shotgun to the roof of the office building. He waited for Maynard to finish visiting his long-lost daughter, Nevaeh, at the strip club across the street. Although Bill was twelve stories up, he still recognized the gal-damn detective’s distinctive waddle through the scope.
Bill pulled the trigger, sending a storm of 6-shot BBs into Maynard, killing the detective instantly.
“Sorry to ruin your reunion, Maynard, but you should’ve known better,” Bill said to himself as he packed up the shotgun. “Nevaeh isn’t Heaven spelled backward. It’s stripper spelled forward. And I’ll be seeing you in hell.”
Accurate Example
Bill Robber hauled the rifle to the roof of the office building. He waited for Maynard to finish visiting his long-lost daughter, Nevaeh, at the strip club across the street. Although he was twelve stories up, Bill still recognized the gal-damn detective’s distinctive waddle through the scope.
Bill pulled the trigger, delivering a hot bullet right into Maynard’s neck.
“Sorry to ruin your reunion, Maynard, but you should’ve known better,” Bill said to himself as he packed up the rifle. “Nevaeh isn’t Heaven spelled backward. It’s stripper spelled forward. And I’ll be seeing you in hell.”
What Went Wrong?
Assuming that the top of a twelve-story office building is about 50 yards up, a shotgun with BBs was a poor choice to give Bill. A rifle is a better pick for that kind of precision and distance.
Using a scope to fire BBs from the shotgun was also a bad call. Outside of a few limited hunting applications, firing shotshells isn’t a precision sport. Sure, it’s possible to toss a scope onto a shotgun to fire shotshells, but it is not common and the writer who uses it risks looking amateurish.
One final point about the BBs: Using 6 shot to take a character out at a distance isn’t a good call. These small BBs will spread out, rendering the pattern ineffective. Better to go with buckshot. If Bill and Maynard were close to each other, using 6 shot would make more sense.
Slugs

Unlike shotshells, shotgun slugs contain a single lead projectile instead of BBs. That projectile is called a slug, hence the name. They are generally effective out to 100 yards but can travel beyond that with limited accuracy. It’s appropriate to refer to shotgun slugs as shells or slugs, but don’t use bullets or shotgun bullets.
Slugs are used exclusively for larger targets, such as big game. They are never appropriate for shooting birds, small game, or sporting clays. In fiction, they’re suitable for shooting characters, and because of how large they are, slugs are absolutely devastating. Sure, being shot with any firearm can be lethal, but slugs hold a special spot in the pantheons of stuff that hurts. Unlike BBs, they will usually pass through a target character, especially if the shooter is up close.
The accessories on a shotgun that shoots slugs are similar to that of a rifle. It’s common to use a shotgun scope for better accuracy. It’s not required, but shotguns used to shoot slugs may have a special rifled barrel with winding grooves inside that spin the slug as it travels out the barrel, just like rifles or handguns do. This spin helps stabilize trajectory and increase accuracy.
When writing, think of slugs like rifle ammunition, only less elegant. In the projectile world, they’re the burly, meat-headed neighbor playing classic rock while working on cars.
Like rifle and handgun bullets, slug entry wounds (the spot where the projectile enters a target) are smaller than exit wounds (the area where the projectile leaves the target as it passes through). This is because the slug expands into a mushroom shape upon impact. Because of their size, slugs get pretty big as they expand. The exit wounds on a character would be obvious for this reason.
Advantages
Slugs don’t require a special type of shotgun. They also allow a shotgun to function similarly to a rifle: The same shotgun that fires shotshells (BBs) can switch over to slugs.
Unlike shotshells, slugs pack a real punch at distances beyond 50 yards, the effective range of most BBs.
Accuracy increases when slugs are used in tandem with a shotgun scope.
A hit from a shotgun slug isn’t something a character could shrug off. Any shotgun firing slugs, from the smallest to the largest, will pack a wallop.
Disadvantages
Shotgun slugs probably wouldn’t be a sniper’s first choice. For picking off target characters with precise shots in complicated scenes, go with a rifle.
Slugs deliver quite the recoil. They kick like a mule. Characters who are not in great physical shape might not want to pull the trigger.
Because of this recoil, if a character shoots a sawed-off single-shot shotgun using slugs with one hand, make sure to write in that character’s trip to the dentist.
Inaccurate Example
“We’ll wait here for Bill to walk his dog. If he comes in close, I’ll cover him with BBs,” Penny Flyswatter told Maynard Soloman as they sat in their hiding spot at the city park. She pumped her 12-gauge shotgun twice and checked her scope. “We need to take out Bill Robber once and for all.”
“And if he’s far away, I’ll clean his gal-damn clock with a bullet,” Maynard said. He took one of Penny’s shells and loaded it into his own 20-gauge with a quick click-clack of the pump.
“Between the two of us, Bill won’t stand a chance,” Penny said. “Although we really shouldn’t discuss our plans to kill someone out loud in a public park.”
Accurate Example
“We’ll wait here for Bill to walk his dog. If he comes in close, I’ll cover him with BBs,” Penny Flyswatter told Maynard Soloman while they sat in their hiding spot at the city park. She loaded her shotgun and added, “We need to take out Bill Robber once and for all.”
“And if he’s far away, I’ll clean his gal-damn clock with a slug,” Maynard said. He loaded a shell into his own 12-gauge with a quick click-clack of the pump.
“Between the two of us, Bill won’t stand a chance,” Penny said. “Although we really shouldn’t discuss our plans to kill someone out loud in a public park.”
What Went Wrong?
At first glance, this scenario doesn’t appear to be too bad. However, there’s plenty that went wrong under the surface.
In the inaccurate example, Maynard and Penny designated one shotgun for shotshells (BBs) and one for slugs. There’s nothing technically wrong with that if they’re using the same gauge shotgun, but they’re not. If they were both using either 12-gauge or 20-gauge shotguns, they could share ammunition.
Now for Penny’s scope. If she’s planning on firing shotshells (BBs), a type of ammunition best suited to targets 50 yards away or closer, a scope doesn’t make much sense. A scope magnifies targets. It’s not necessary if Penny plans to shoot Bill at close range. In fact, a scope can make it more difficult to aim at close ranges. She’d be better off without it.
Penny also pumped her shotgun twice, which is a mistake. Once is fine when loading ammunition. Unless she fires a shot, which she didn’t, that second pump will just dump an unfired shell onto the ground.
Maynard said he’ll “clean his gal-damn clock with a bullet” from his shotgun. Bullet is the wrong usage. Gun-savvy writers call the projectile a slug instead.
Maynard could just as easily switched to a rifle in the accurate example, too. That would make the bullet usage kosher.
