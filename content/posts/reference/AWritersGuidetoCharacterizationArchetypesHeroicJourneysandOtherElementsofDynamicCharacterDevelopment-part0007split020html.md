A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
 THE NURTURER AND THE MYSTIC
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
Both of these gentle types come to the aid of others freely. The Nurturer, however, makes her life more open and accessible to them, and the Mystic guards her time wisely. They easily keep each other company for hours and make great roommates. The Nurturer can take care of everything if she wishes it, and the Mystic will not take advantage of her.
The Nurturer can teach the Mystic how to help others in a way that is comfortable to her. For instance, she might help those who are mystical and in need of guidance. The Nurturer can assure the Mystic that she need not be available to all for all kinds of problems and issues.
The Mystic can teach the Nurturer how to guard her time so she will have more energy to devote to her own work.
