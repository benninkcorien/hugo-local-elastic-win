A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
JOBS THAT GO AGAINST TYPE
It’s not mandatory that an archetype hold one of the jobs specified in her category. In fact, if you mix and match the jobs, you can create a lot of comedy. This works well if your story is character driven, as much of the plot and subtext will be about her fitting in where she doesn’t belong.
A good example is the film Miss Congeniality staring Sandra Bullock. She plays an FBI agent who is forced to join a beauty contest under cover. The writers placed their Amazon type heroine into a role typically suited for the Seductive Muse archetype and found many opportunities for comedy.
Once you understand what jobs are suited for each archetype you can then make better choices about your heroine’s occupation and how it will fit into your story.
Maybe a Maiden has to work at a funeral parlor or a Mystic has to work at a strip club.
