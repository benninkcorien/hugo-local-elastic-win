A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Other characters usually support the right use of assertiveness and power, as well as good decision making and the seizing of opportunities. It’s a question of who the character is to the hero. Usually one area of the hero’s life, whether it’s work or family, is going to suffer in order for him to become an assertive leader who is focused and ready for opportunity. To create drama and conflict, you can have ancillary events occur and mess things up so the hero misses opportunities.
For this hero, being assertive means using his strengths in a healthy way. It’s not aggressive, though other characters may see it that way and accuse him of doing something bad. The hero’s newfound assertiveness will change the dynamic between him and his friends. That’s why this is a powerful lesson to learn—an outwardly focused lesson. The hero may need to learn how to be more assertive or how to juggle priorities and have balance in life.
