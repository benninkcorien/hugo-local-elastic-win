A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Supporting characters may feel that this lesson is imperative to the hero. Usually heroes who have been very intensely rushing through life cause ‘collateral damage’ for their supporting characters. Each time the hero suffers another dilemma, the supporting characters help him pick up the pieces. So the supporters might be happy, perhaps to a smug degree, to watch the hero learn this lesson. They may support him wholeheartedly, or they may do their best to help him avoid the lesson for their own personal gain. It, of course, depends on their relationship.
People who are in a subordinate position at work may have no choice but to help him in his pursuits. They have to do what he says even if they see that he’s moving in a useless direction.
