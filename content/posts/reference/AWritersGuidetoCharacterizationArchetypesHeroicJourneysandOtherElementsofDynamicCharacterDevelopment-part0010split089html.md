A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Smelling:
   •  Does the hero smell of musk and cologne?
   •  Are there flowers nearby? Did he buy them for her?
   •  Is someone cooking nearby?
   •  Are they near the ocean, and she can smell the ocean breeze?
Describe love as if it were a smell. “The sweet scent of a rose in the morning dew.”
