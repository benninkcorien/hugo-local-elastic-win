Marine
Final Exam: The SOCEX
The second week of July 1995 was terribly hot and muggy. It was the kind of heat designed to break men--and even Marines. Hot or not, for the members of the 26th MEU (SOC) and PHIBRON 4, it was final examination time. I didn't have a chance to observe this exercise, but word filtered back that they had performed "superbly" and were now ready to head out to relieve Marty Berndt and his 24th MEU (SOC) from their vigil in the Adriatic. But before that, they had one more hurdle to clear--an exercise tacked onto the end of their SOCEX called Joint Task Force Exercise 1995 (JTFEX-95).
