A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and an AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, and she can help him with this, but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can push people hard to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. He is so used to structure and planning that he can’t help her with this at all. He’s not even sure he believes what she believes. If he’s willing to suspend his disbelief, he can be an asset by helping her plan things out.
If he refuses to take her seriously or believe in her, he will be a drawback. He may cause her to doubt herself and her task. He may also do too much analyzing for her taste.
In general, she won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. This kind of woman doesn’t fit well with the Businessman, who finds a career and stays put for as long as it takes to accomplish his goals. She always has a new agenda or cause to work for.
