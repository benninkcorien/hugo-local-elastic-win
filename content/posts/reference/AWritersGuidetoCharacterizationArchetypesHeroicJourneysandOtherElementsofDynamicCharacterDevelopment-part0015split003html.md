A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR CHARACTER RESIST THIS LESSON?
Whether the hero has the necessary zeal to take this on or not, this lesson is life-changing. It’s life-changing to become assertive and to analyze your priorities and determine how well you are handling them. The internal drive to achieve these things is necessary and may be enough to make a change, but the hero will face pressure from the outside world to stay the course and not be assertive. Even if he is being assertive and going for that opportunity, other characters may not want to see that opportunity happen for him. If the hero does not want to disappoint people, he may have trouble being assertive.
Here are some other reasons your character might resist this lesson:
   •  We like to please others, which is not very assertive.
   •  We like to be a part of the group and part of the team.
   •  We like to be accepted and valued.
   •  We don’t want to lose our friends and feel alone and abandoned. We want to be accepted and included by our peers.
