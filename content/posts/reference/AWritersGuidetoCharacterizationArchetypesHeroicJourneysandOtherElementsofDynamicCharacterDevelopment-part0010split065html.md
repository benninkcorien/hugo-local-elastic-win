A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE MYSTIC
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to feel vulnerable to change, and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. The Mystic is not one to make him feel vulnerable unless he falls in love with her.
She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. As a very strong and powerful man, the King can teach her to be assertive, but it’s more likely that he will be assertive for her and she will feel cared for.
If he is going through a midlife crisis of some sort, or just looking for a change, she will be a wonderful mystery to him. She can change his whole world, maybe even bring him in touch with his spirituality.
He may be in awe of her spiritual and paranormal abilities. They may offer a great escape from his day-to-day grind, and he will look forward to seeing her. She’s so different from everyone else he deals with every day.
He probably won’t believe in anything but science. For him, it must be proven to be real. This is where they can clash, especially if he attacks her core beliefs. She can’t understand why he does what he does for a living. She would never want so much responsibility, and she’s not one to play house for someone so demanding.
