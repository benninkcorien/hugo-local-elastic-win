A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
City of Angels
An angel falls in love with his charge and decides to fall from grace to become human and be with her.
Sixteen Candles
The heroine goes through a life-changing birthday when she tries to figure out what to do about her crush on the most popular boy in school, while dealing with a multitude of situations beyond her control including her sister’s wedding, a house full of extended family, and advances from the geekiest boy in school. In the end she is completely transformed.
Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare
Transformation is the most important theme of this story about changing someone into society’s image. “O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man. (Induction.1.4)”
Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw
A Victorian dialect expert bets that he can teach a lower-class girl to speak proper English and pass her off as a lady.
