A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE FOOL
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
These two enjoy each other’s company and can hang out for hours. The Recluse usually honors the Fool’s free spirit and sees facets of himself in the Fool. The Fool looks up to the Recluse—even if they are the same age—because the Recluse has more confidence and conviction. He is able to stick to his guns and form his own life no matter what others think of it.
The Recluse can teach the Fool to be confident in his decisions and to welcome the responsibility of living on his own and on his own terms.
The Fool can remind the Recluse that there is more to life than meditation and that life is full of wonder, just as the spiritual world is.
