FIRST-PERSON POV
FIRST-PERSON POV
Quote: “Emotions are critical to making a character feel real, but describing them from afar can sometimes leave a reader feeling a little disconnected from that character. The descriptions don’t feel like a character feeling, but like the author telling the reader how the character feels.” —author and blogger, Janice Hardy
As requested by a number of writers, I have included a chapter on writing Deep POV through the eyes and ears and senses of a first-person narrator.
When you’re writing in first-person point-of-view always strive to stay in Deeper POV. Actually, most editors and bestselling authors would agree that first-person narratives are the easiest way to avoid telling.
While writing in deep first-person POV, try to make sure that each scene is intimate and detailed for your readers by being specific whenever possible and revising any filter words.
Even with first-person POV, you’re never limited in describing a character’s facial expressions or emotions. Although, the first-person narrator can’t see his or her own face, a writer can still vividly describe the character’s expressions and emotions and body language.
There are many ways to “show” reactions or emotions for a first-person POV narrator, instead of just telling the reader what the character’s emotions are directly. Writers should revise any shallow words like “felt / feel” to describe an emotion.
Please compare these examples…
SHALLOW: Staring into the utter darkness, I felt my palms grow damp.
DEEP POV: Staring into the utter darkness, my palms grew damp.
SHALLOW: I felt my face get hot in embarrassment.
DEEP POV: My cheeks burned at his rude remark.
SHALLOW: I felt sweaty and nervous before the talent audition.
DEEP POV: Sweat beaded my forehead and I restlessly paced backstage.
SHALLOW: I felt sad on my long walk home.
DEEP POV: My lips pulled downward at the corners and I blinked back tears while I drudged home.
SHALLOW: I felt really angry at Amy for forgetting my birthday again.
DEEP POV: I stomped my foot. “Seriously, Amy? You forgot my birthday day again?”
SHALLOW: I felt lust fill my body when I saw Kenneth.
DEEP POV: A burst of sizzling desire heated my body as Kenneth entered the room.

I mainly write in first-person and that’s why most of the excerpts are taken from my own work as examples of Deeper POV.
Here is another one with too many filtering references…
SHALLOW:
I could not see in the darkness as I moved through the brambles.
This is really creepy, I thought.
There was an old farmhouse somewhere near Maple Drive. I thought I would be okay if I could just find the path. Suddenly, I saw headlights, blinding me. Then I heard a car on the road and I felt my body freeze. My legs felt wobbly and I knew my breathing had increased. I heard the car rev its engine and it sounded scary.
I knew I had to move out of the way when I noticed the old car drive past.
Here is the scene revised without the filter words…
DEEP POV: 
I stumbled in the darkness through the brambles.
This is really creepy.
An old farmhouse sat somewhere near Maple Drive. I’d be okay if I could just find the path. Suddenly, headlights shone in my eyes, blinding me. The crunch of tires on the gravel road caused me to freeze in my tracks. My legs wobbled and my breathing sped up. The car revs its engine ominously.
I leaped out of the way just as the rusty Buick rumbled past.

Since I primarily write in first-person POV, I don’t think it’s necessarily incorrect for my characters to “interpret” the expressions or body language of another character as long as they aren’t too specific.
This next excerpt is from, LOST in STARLIGHT, which will show writers how to lace “voice” with action and humor into your first-person descriptions. This example shows embarrassment (along with other emotions) without stating the feeling.
Please study this first-person POV scene…
DEEP POV:
“It’s just...” His voice is soft. “I want to be clear, we can’t be anything more than friends, Sloane…you’ll only end up collateral damage.”
I frown. “Collateral damage? What the hell does that even mean?”
Hayden takes a shallow breath. “Dammit, I’m saying this all wrong.”
“Ya think?”
“It’s to protect you.”
I arch an eyebrow. “From?”
“I can’t...” He groans and his long bangs flop onto his forehead, nearly obscuring his anxious stare. “I want you to be safe and I can be really impulsive. It’s just that when I catch the way you look at me sometimes, I get the feeling you’d like something more than friendship.”
Oh. My. God.
Am I that obvious?
An even hotter flush steals across my face and sweeps down my neck. I am beyond mortified. This is bad. So bad. I need to take my fragile, wounded ego and go hide. For, oh…like a decade.
For a moment, my vision goes black and red. My body shudders. I need to get away from him. Now. I step stiffly forward and trip on my shoelace, staggering off the curb and onto the pavement…

Here are more examples of writing Deeper POV from the first-person perspective. Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW: I felt light-headed and I wanted to throw up.
DEEP POV: A bout of nausea struck my senses and my body swayed.
SHALLOW: I was scared of the dark and I forgot my flashlight.
DEEP POV: My heart rate kicked into overdrive. The light switch didn’t work, and I had stupidly forgotten to bring a flashlight.
SHALLOW: I was shocked to discover that I won the contest.
DEEP POV: The breath caught in my lungs. I’d won the contest!
SHALLOW: I became thoughtful. “Tell me more,” I inquired.
DEEP POV: I frowned, tapping a finger on my chin. “Tell me more.”
SHALLOW: My face had a panicked look on it.
DEEP POV: Every molecule in my body turned icy, and my expression froze.
SHALLOW: I’m really worried about Karen’s illness.
DEEP POV: My palms are sweating. The doctors just had to find a way to save Karen.
SHALLOW: I knew my face was pinched in disgust. (Cliché)
DEEP POV: My lips turned downward and I turned away.
SHALLOW: I heard Janice running up the driveway.
DEEP POV: Janice’s sneakered feet pounded the gravel on the driveway.
SHALLOW: I saw Hank stealing a candy bar.
DEEP POV: Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Hank stuffing a candy bar into his pocket.
SHALLOW: “You are a liar,” I said, my facial expression turning into a scowl.
DEEP POV: “You’re such a liar!” I said, rolling my eyes.

Could you grasp how removing filtering references can instantly deepen the POV?
Here is an excerpt taken from the first chapter of my young adult paranormal romance novel, BEAUTIFULLY BROKEN, (free to download or read on Wattpad for a limited time) to give writers another example on how to cleverly write Deeper POV from a first-person narrator. The character becomes nervous and frightened when she suspects that she’s not alone in her bedroom, but the emotions are never blatantly stated in this short scene.
Please carefully examine this example…
DEEP POV:
For as long as I could remember, I’d heard whispers in the shadows. Black, twisting shapes that chilled my blood. Slithering through the night, their greenish skin, crimson eyes, and sharp claws were illuminated even in the dark.
Sunlight often meant the difference between life and death.
I normally felt safe during the day, with the heat of the sun brushing my skin, so that morning, when the shadows showed up in my bedroom, I barely recognized their eerie whispering.
The desk lamp flickered, startling me. I stared at the last line I’d typed on my essay for English class, one hand hovering over the keyboard.
Homework could wait. 
I raised my head and closed the laptop. My heart hammered. A hint of chilling menace climbed up my spine. Finishing homework was the last thing on my mind.
The spooky, inhuman whispering grew more intense.
Setting the laptop aside, I jumped off the bed, nearly tripping over my long nightgown. I scanned the dark bends and edges of the room. The swirling azure colors of the witch-ball suspended over the bed rotated in a slow circle. I got down on my hands and knees to check under the bed. Nothing.
The closet door was open a crack. I stood up and wavered, shoulders hitching.
I hesitated for a second before walking over to the closet and kicking the door open. On tiptoes, I leaned over the threshold, stretching to grasp the brass chain, and then gave it a yank. Light bled across dirty laundry, illuminating metal hangers scattered on the floor. Dusty board games littered the shelf, and haphazardly hanging clothes swayed on the bar. My fuzzy bunny slippers stared upward with glassy button eyes. Nothing unusual.
So why was I so freaked?
The feeling, indistinct but ominous, lingered like the remnants of a bad dream. I couldn’t isolate the source. But something felt wrong.
The closet light and lamp blew out. As I turned around, my peripheral vision caught a maelstrom of shadows. Things withered within it. Something snaked past my leg….

There is one rhetorical question in this scene, but besides that, it stays in a very tight and close viewpoint.
Now I challenge you to rewrite a scene in your own story and use Deep POV to get inside the head of your first-person narrator and keep your readers in close-and-personal.
One last word of advice, the first-person narrator can only reveal his/her own thoughts and feelings and reactions, and then merely assume or guess the responses or meanings of facial expressions of the other characters. A first-person character is not a mind-reader, so be careful of this POV violation.
The next few chapters will cover on how to revise “stating a feeling or reaction” instead of telling the reader what the character is feeling. All of the Deep POV examples in this handbook have already been used in my published novels or short stories, so you’ll need to come up with your own unique variations.
