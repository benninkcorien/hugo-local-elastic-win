A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
Many people are familiar with the fear of change. Changing one’s outlook on life is a scary prospect. But many of us want to do it in an effort to be happier. We all want joy in our lives. We all want to better deal with the pain in our lives. Most of the time, we just can’t figure out how to do it.
Many of us believe that having certain things, or striving for perfection, or achieving knowledge will save us. When those things don’t work, some people look to pills or doctors to save them. They don’t realize that they need to save themselves, that they need to change their outlook on life. Living the moment in a different way may be the answer. Most people would be very interested to see how a heroine navigates through such waters.
