A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
Twists on this lesson can occur if the hero starts questioning life in a negative way, for instance, a way that pulls him down a path that isn’t about mysticism or enlightenment. He gets wrapped up in something that is not working for the social good, though it may have started out that way. For instance, perhaps he becomes involved in a cult or in a revolution that is not helpful. He does not have the best intentions and instead is manipulating people or giving money to a cause that turns out to be harmful. Or maybe the money he donates is not being used for what the leaders of the cult say it’s being used for. In that case, a deeper exploration of trust and ethics becomes part of the lesson.
