FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Quote: “One of the most difficult problems plaguing writers is how to describe facial expressions. The problem arises if the writer does not describe facial expressions at all, or if they provide cliché, or overused descriptions...” —freelance writer and English teacher, Roger Colby 
Expressions are one of the universal languages of emotion, because just a look can instantly convey whatever a person might be feeling, such as joy, sorrow, anger, or fear, etc. And how your POV characters interprets these expressions is essential to page-turning prose. But for some writers it can be hard to find the right verbs or adjectives to describe facial expressions or emotional reactions, so use this chapter as a handy resource for ideas on describing the expressions of the characters, without stating the emotion.
In my opinion, using the filter word: felt or feel is the weakest way to depict an emotion. If a writer uses shallower writing like, he felt miserable or she felt livid, or he was traumatized or she was excited it takes the narrative out of Deeper POV. As writers, we should always be exploring new ways to describe character emotions and expressions.
One way to avoid shallower writing is to express a character’s moods, responses, and emotions by describing their reactions and body language. There are endless creative ways to describe expressions and elicit a reader response.
Please take a look at these examples of facial expressions…
Suspicion: Eyes hooded or narrowed
Surprise/shock: Eyes wide or open
Fear/sorrow/disappointment: Lip quivering
Disgust/abhorrence: Nose wrinkles or lips turn downward
Thoughtful/confused: Brow furrows or lips puckered
Sadness/shock: Tears or shaky movements
Annoyed/frustrated: Eye twitching or eye rolling
Inquisitive/doubtful: Raised eyebrow or long stare
Hesitant/uncertain: Biting lips or tugging on ear
Rage/displeasure: Pursed lips or flushed face/ears
Calm/happy: Smiling /body relaxed

When describing facial expressions, one thing that a writer can mention is the character’s eyes. Eyes are very expressive, and they can tell a reader a lot about what a character is thinking, feeling, or trying to communicate. Eyes that dart around usually indicate a character that is lying or nervous. If a character is lying, then show the reader a slight twitch at the corner of the mouth. The character might avoid eye contact too, if he/she is trying to hide something. Eyes that are big and round can convey surprise. Or eyes that are droopy or lowered can indicate sleepiness or boredom. (But please don’t over use “eyes” to convey emotions.)
A writer can also describe a character’s mouth to reveal emotions or even a strong reaction. If the character is grinning, it shows that he/she is feeling joyful, content, or satisfied. Sometimes, a character might be hiding a negative or painful emotion behind the mask of a smile. A slight twitch of the upper lip may indicate amusement, or even disgust. When a character is frowning it shows the reader that he/she is unhappy, angry, or even thoughtful. Or if the lips are pulled downward, it could show annoyance.
Writers can show a melancholy expression with tear-filled eyes, slumped posture, drooping mouth, and loud sighs. Or a flushed face with tense shoulders and flashing eyes indicates an angry character.
Please review this list of common facial expressions…
ANGER: Eyebrows squeezed together, brows knitted, eyes squinty, pupils flared, lowered head, nostrils flared, looking upward through a scrunched brow, tight facial muscles, flat lips, flaring nostrils, or an penetrating gaze.
CONTEMPT: Squinty eyes, mouth snapped shut, mouth set in a hard line, or lips pressed together, grinding teeth, muscle in jaw twitching, face turns crimson, ears red or hot, or hardened expression.
EXCITEMENT: Smile shows teeth, eyes wide, flushed cheeks, eyebrows high, twinkle in eyes, tears in eyes, dimples showing, or raised eyebrows.
FEAR: Pale skin, eyebrows are drawn together, trembling mouth, brows furrowed, creased forehead, eyes wide and huge, blinking rapidly, mouth opening and closing, or tense, white lips.
FRUSTRATION: Slanting eyebrows, jaw tightened, face reddened, chin raised, deep frowning, gnashed teeth, tense eyebrows, squinty eyes, lips pulled back, or mouth twisted to one side.
REVULSION: Frowning, gritted teeth, lips drew back in a snarl, lowered head, tense lips, eyebrows drawn together, wrinkled forehead, or pursed lips.
SURPRISE: Wide eyes, mouth hanging open, huge smile, flushed face, gaping, raised eyebrows, pupils are huge, and head held back, intense gaze, and eyebrows lifted.
SADNESS: Pale face, lower lip quivered, tears shimmered in eyes, frowning of lips, head hangs low, pouty expression, or gaze downcast.
HAPPINESS: Smiling big with teeth visible, flushed cheeks, crinkle at corners of the eyes, the corners of mouth turned upward, eyes lit up, tears shone in eyes, face glowing.

Another great way to describe a character’s expression is to avoid using an “external camera” to catalogue facial expressions or body language as an impartial description. Writers should dig deeper to show the emotions because these are indications that readers can use to determine how a characters feels or reacts. Sometimes a more complex description of someone’s posture, expression, or mannerisms is needed, and on occasion, it’s better to just simplify the description by telling.
