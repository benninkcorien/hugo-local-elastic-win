A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Hearing:
   •  Do they talk during lovemaking?
   •  Does she cry out?
   •  Is there music playing in the background?
   •  What noises are in the setting?
   •  Does the cry of a wolf scare her and send her into the hero’s arms?
   •  Can they hear others approaching nearby?
Describe love as if it were a sound. “…the flutter of birds overhead, soaring into the night sky.”
