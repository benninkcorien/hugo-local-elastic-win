A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE KING
SPIRITUAL VS. MENTAL
These two archetypes do not make a great match. The Recluse values his private time and will not stand for the King’s demands on him. He may not voice his feelings, but his actions will speak loud and clear, and drive the King crazy.
The King sees the Recluse’s private time as selfish and inconsiderate of others. If the King needs him now then he must come now. End of story.
The King can teach the Recluse what it means to be part of a group, how you have to give a little in order to receive.
The Recluse can teach the King that everyone in the family is an individual and should be respected as such—that everyone has their own flow and timing to life. Perhaps the King would like to take a moment alone?
