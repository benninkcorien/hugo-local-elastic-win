Marine
For Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady.
A downed and doomed "zoomie" whose faith in his God,
his country, his service, and himself,
along with the help of a few Marines, brought him
home to us. God bless him, and
the members of the 24th MEU (SOC)
who made us all proud to be Americans once again.
