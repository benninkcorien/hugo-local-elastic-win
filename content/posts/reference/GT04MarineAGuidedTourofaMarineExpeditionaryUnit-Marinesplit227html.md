Marine
Prime Minister's Residence, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 0900 Hours, September 21st, 2008
The Malaysian Prime Minister was running amok, and he had not even left his office. The reports coming in from around his country showed a series of very precise and selective strikes by aircraft and missiles, as well as some kind of counter-invasion in Brunei. Like all English-educated men, he had been raised on the stories of how Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had planned to defeat the D-Day invasion in 1944 by destroying the beachhead before the end of what he called "the longest day." There were now fifteen hours left in his "longest day," and he needed to make the most of them.
He had already called in the Chief of Staff of the Malaysian Army, and had laid out his demands. The Americans had gained two footholds in Brunei. The first, in BSB itself, seemed to be quite robust. The other, around the oil-production facilities of Seria, was smaller--and it was now holding the only thing that he had cared about in the first place. The holder of those wells and facilities might still be able to negotiate with the new Sultan, who would surely follow this invasion into BSB in the next few days. Perhaps the right to negotiate the Spratly oil leases could be traded for the survival of the existing North Borneo wells. It made sense. The two Malaysian brigades were ordered to attack the Marines defending Seria and retake the oil field. It was the last chance to salvage something from this adventure.
