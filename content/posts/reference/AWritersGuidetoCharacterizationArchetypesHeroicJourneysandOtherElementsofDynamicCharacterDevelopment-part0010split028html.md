A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings. She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks. Neither of them can help the other with these tasks as the Seductive Muse loves to explore physically and the Fool will definitely see a woman for her looks before her brain.
The Fool likes being around someone who is uninhibited like the Seductive Muse but he doesn’t like romantic entanglements. If he makes this clear up front, then she will accept it and they can have a good time.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the Fool as easygoing, someone who will let her be as noncommittal as she wants to be. He may not have the take-charge personality that she craves.
She’ll have her freedom with him if he is well adjusted and not the jealous type. If he gets jealous easily he will probably leave at the first sign of trouble. He’s afraid to commit to someone—jealousy is the first sign that he’s in too deep.
