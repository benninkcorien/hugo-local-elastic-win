A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Napoleon Bonaparte to The Empress Josephine (February 1796):
“My waking thoughts are all of you. Your portrait and the remembrance of last night’s delirium have robbed my sense of repose. Sweet and Incomparable Josephine, what an extraordinary influence you have over my heart.
Are you vexed? Do I see you sad? Are you ill at ease? My soul is broken with grief and there is no rest for your lover…
But is there more for me’ when, delivering ourselves up to the deep feelings which master me, I breathe out upon your lips, upon your heart, a flame which burns me up? Ah! it was this past night I realized that your portrait was not you.
You start at noon. I shall see you in three hours. Meanwhile, mio dolce amour, accept a thousand kisses, but give me none, for they fire my blood.”
