A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE KING
SPIRITUAL VS. MENTAL
The King doesn’t understand how the Male Messiah can pick up and leave when he feels ‘called’ upon to do so. His first ‘mission,’ and loyalty, is to his ‘people.’
The King can help the Male Messiah if the Male Messiah needs someone to ‘watch the troops’ while he’s off setting things up for them.
The Male Messiah can teach the King that he is not the end-all of the universe, that sometimes people have to be left alone so they can fall and thus grow.
