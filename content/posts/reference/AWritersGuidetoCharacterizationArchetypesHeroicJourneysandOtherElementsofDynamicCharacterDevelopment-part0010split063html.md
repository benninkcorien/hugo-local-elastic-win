A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE NURTURER
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to feel vulnerable to change, and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. The Nurturer can’t make him feel vulnerable. Being the Caretaker that she is, the Nurturer won’t stand up to the King. She will always try to be understanding with him because she sees the kind of day he’s had.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and to find her own identity—not things the King can help her with since he often encourages people to depend on him. His attitude is, “I’ll provide everything.”
He may not like her helping other people so much. He feels her attention should be focused on him, and that these people are taking advantage of her. He may say, “She should be paid. She should be rewarded. She should take care of herself more.” He’ll never understand her, and he may do better with a woman who is stronger than the Nurturer but more subservient to him.
She would be a great match for a King who pushes others away with his demands and rulership. She doesn’t want to leave him without giving him another chance. They can be a great match.
Very few people take the time to understand and stick by him. Most of them do it out of fear, she can do it out of love. He never may have known real love before, and her nurturing can touch his heart.
