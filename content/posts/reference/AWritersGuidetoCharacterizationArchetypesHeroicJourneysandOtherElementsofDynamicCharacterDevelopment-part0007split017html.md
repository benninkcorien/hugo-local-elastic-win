A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
Of these two archetypes, we can make the stretch and say they both work on a team for the greater good of the ‘mission,’ but that is where the similarities end. In the end the Female Messiah usually has to go it alone when the rest of the team cannot follow through.
Many times the Female Messiah is trying to break apart the companies and systems the Father’s Daughter holds dear. On an individual basis, the Female Messiah will (like the Mystic) guide the Father’s Daughter to look inside of herself, a place she doesn’t really want to go.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Female Messiah to think things through clearly before she acts, thus preventing a lot of mistakes that would force the rest of the Female Messiah’s team to drop out.
