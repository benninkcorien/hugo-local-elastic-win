A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to feel vulnerable to change. The Seductive Muse can make him feel that way if he falls deeply in love with her, but sometimes a tragic event is what does it.
She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks. Being so mentally focused, brains are what the King notices first.
The King loves to be around people who are strong and in control of their emotions. She can be very strong, but she is also very feeling and sensual. (The Femme Fatale can really cause him trouble!)
He may see her as a wonderful playmate and confidant. He feels like she understands him, like they operate on the same wavelength, until she goes into creative mode. He doesn’t pursue his creative side. It’s too emotional. He’s too much in control for that. She’s fun and outgoing.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the King as a great provider but a little too serious for her taste. She knows he’s not the most faithful man, but she will enjoy his company all the same. She loves a take-charge kind of guy, and he can definitely take charge—of everything.
