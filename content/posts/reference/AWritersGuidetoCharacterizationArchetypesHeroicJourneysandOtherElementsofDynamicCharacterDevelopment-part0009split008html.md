A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE RECLUSE
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Protector and the Recluse are very much alike. The Protector wants to rule his own life and work hours. He wants his boss to leave him alone. The Protector needs causes and people to fight for. He likes to be in the thick of things. The Recluse simply likes to be separate from all attachments. ‘Live and let live,’ he says.
The Protector can teach the Recluse how to take a stand and how to fight for what he believes in. The Recluse does have opinions and causes, but he supports them in solitary ways.
The Recluse can teach the Protector to relax and take some time to renew herself. His body is sore from stress and fighting.
