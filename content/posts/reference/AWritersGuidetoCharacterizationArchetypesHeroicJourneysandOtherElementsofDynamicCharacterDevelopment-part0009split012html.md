A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE ARTIST
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Protector is strong and fights for others, but he has control of his emotions to some degree. The Artist does not have control over his emotions. He can’t seem to master them.
The Artist knows he’s not strong like the Protector is, but he doesn’t see the need to be unless the Protector is fighting against him. The Protector may even have to protect the Artist when the Artist insults others.
The Artist can teach the Protector to express his emotions and to look at the beauty in the world from an artist’s perspective. The Protector can teach the Artist to take responsibility for his outbursts and to learn to control himself.
