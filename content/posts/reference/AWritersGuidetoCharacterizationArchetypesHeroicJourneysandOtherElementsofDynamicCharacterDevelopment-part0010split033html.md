A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE MYSTIC
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and the AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings; these are the Mystic’s specialties. She can teach him how to control himself and be more aware of others.
She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. As a free spirit, he can teach her to enjoy life’s pleasures, big and small. He can open up a whole new world for her and make it fun in the process. He can bring her out of her shell.
He may try to goad her into some crazy risks but if she complies she will be doing so for her own reasons and not to prove herself to him. She can’t be manipulated like that.
He may be in awe of her spiritual and paranormal abilities, and he may even try to learn about them in detail. Maybe he can have the same experiences? What an adventure for him.
