SHALLOW: PAIN
SHALLOW: PAIN
Quote: “Creating character emotions remains one of my toughest challenges as a budding novelist. To truly show these characters and put them forth on the screen [or in a book] as though they were living and breathing, without making it seem cardboard is in one word: a challenge.” —writer and blogger, Casey Herringshaw
For many writers, trying to describe pain or discomfort can be difficult. Even though pain is not an emotion, but more of a feeling, it should be described through a Deeper POV.
When trying to describe a character’s pain to readers, writers should try to “show” the feeling by being descriptive enough to let the reader visualize what the character is experiencing while also respecting their intelligence, which means showing and not telling.
In order to make the reader empathetic to the character’s pain, a writer should use metaphors or some specific language. To really convey the character’s suffering (severe, throbbing, tender or sore, abrupt or intensifying), a writer can describe pain through the actions and reactions of the character.
For instance, if you’re writing an intense fight scene, describing the pain of a kick or a punch to the face, should be short and to the point to keep the action moving forward. Or to deepen characterization, a tough and apathetic type character might get shot, but only display pain by gritting their teeth. Alternatively, a wimpy or fearful character with any type of injury might whimper and cry over just stubbing their toe.
Some of the best advice I can give writers is to keep the reader “hooked” by showing the character’s actions as opposed to stating them. If a character is injured, a writer can show the character grimacing when he moves and rubbing his back, so the reader can just conclude that the character has back pain.
Some physical signs of pain might be:
Elevated blood pressure
Dilated pupil size
Perspire heavily
Hands and/or feet can be cold
Clenching or grinding the teeth
Covering, rubbing, or grabbing the pained area
Wincing when touched
Eyes that water or excess crying
Writhing or constant shifting in position
Moaning or groaning
Below, I’ve put together some examples of shallow writing compared to Deeper POV to show a character in pain rather than state it for the reader. None of my examples are terribly original, but they should give writers ideas on how to revise their own stories.
Now to be clear, I think it’s perfectly fine to use the word “pain” in your writing if needed; however, anytime you can revise with Deeper POV, you should.
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I felt tense with pain in my upper body.
DEEP POV: The tightness across my shoulders increased.
SHALLOW: He closed his eyes against the pain.
DEEP POV: A flicker of agony passed behind his closed lids.
SHALLOW: My head hurt with a bad headache.
DEEP POV: My brain felt like the hot mash of decaying potatoes.
SHALLOW: He thought the pain was bad.
DEEP POV: His pulse beat a tattoo at the base of his throat.
SHALLOW: I moved slowly to get to safety, but my body felt sore.
DEEP POV: I crawled to safety, a sensation of coldness lapped around my heart.
SHALLOW: He couldn’t see very well when the pain increased.
DEEP POV: His vision went white with discomfort.
SHALLOW: The gunshot hurt and caused a lot of pain. She felt dizzy as the paramedic leaned over her body.
DEEP POV: The throbbing from the gunshot wound pulsed. Everything funneled, so she only glimpsed the paramedic’s face above her.
SHALLOW: I wanted to cry from the pain of the hot poker as it hit my shoulder.
DEEP POV: My insides writhed when the hot poker struck my shoulder.
SHALLOW: The older man’s expression looked distressed.
DEEP POV: The old man’s face grimaced and he moaned.
SHALLOW: Jane felt a pain in her head.
DEEP POV: Jane rested her head in her hands and began to rub her temples.
SHALLOW: He laughed and felt a pain in his stomach.
DEEP POV: When he laughed, the ache in his belly flashed hard and quick.
SHALLOW: She had a bad pain in her side.
DEEP POV: If only her hips would stop aching.
Please study and compare these next two examples…
SHALLOW: I realized that I had a hard time concentrating on the test because I knew that I had a pain in my forehead. I thought if I took some pain medication it would help my headache.
DEEP POV: I clenched my teeth and rubbed my temple. The sharp throbbing spread across my forehead, blooming into a full-blown headache. I needed aspirin and quick if I hoped to pass the test.
***
I have included two longer scenes that provide an illustration on how to show pain. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the obvious areas of shallower writing, but see if you can easily spot it.)
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
I felt the knife stab into my skin and then the man plunged it deeper into my stomach. The pain was intense and the knife felt like it was sinking into my organs, and then there was a horrible, excruciating feeling of pain. I felt my eyes roll into the back of my head as the knife was suddenly pulled out of my flesh. Then I panicked as I put my hands over my wound, because I felt desperate to slow the blood that was rushing out. The blood went straight through my fingers and I saw it hit the ground.
Bland paragraphs like the one above reveal a practice that’s very common with new writers, where they not only tend to overwrite, but state facts in a bland way. Please closely examine this scene rewritten…
DEEP POV:
The knife speared my stomach, and I stumbled backward as the searing force seemed to strike every nerve in my body. A taste of bile rose in my throat. The man advanced and thrust the blade in deeper, striking my organs. I hissed out a breath and fell to my knees. My vision blurred when the knife was jerked from my flesh.
Instinctively, I placed my hands over the wound, but the flow of blood seeped through my fingers and hit the ground like a thick, scarlet stream of death.

This chapter should give writers some clever ideas on how to rewrite any shallower scenes. And please take all of these suggestions to heart, and only make the changes that you feel will best suit your writing style and story.
