A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
These two are opposites in every way. The Seductive Muse loves her body and is very spontaneous. She loves to be the center of attention and can be very emotional. She can go with the flow of life.
This is directly opposed to the Father’s Daughter’s way of life. She’s in touch with her mind and does things by the book. She is all for the team and doesn’t want to stand out as the center of attention. She can be very out of touch with her emotions and may see them as a weakness.
At the same time the Father’s Daughter is very left-brained and smart. Top of her class and very accomplished. She can talk for hours about any intellectual subject and she knows her facts.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Father’s Daughter to get in touch with her feelings and sensuality—her feminine side. The Father’s Daughter can teach the Seductive Muse how to get along in the world and provide for herself in a left-brained, logical world.
