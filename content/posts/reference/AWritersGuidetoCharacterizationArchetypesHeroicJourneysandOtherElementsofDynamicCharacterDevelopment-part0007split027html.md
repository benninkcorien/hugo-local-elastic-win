A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MYSTIC AND THE MAIDEN
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Mystic and Maiden enjoy each other’s company. The Mystic usually honors the Maiden’s free spirit and sees a version of herself in her. The Maiden looks up to the Mystic—even if they are the same age—because the Mystic has more confidence and conviction.
The Mystic can teach the Maiden how to have something of her own at no cost. The mystical realms that she can dabble in when she has free time are there for the taking.
The Maiden can teach the Mystic that there is more to life than meditation. She can show the Mystic that life is full of wonder just as the spiritual world is.
