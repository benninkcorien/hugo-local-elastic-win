A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE BUFFALO’S CHARACTER ARC
Cynicism, pessimism, and self-deprecation are signs of shame and self-punishment. They are not noble qualities and they do not result from realistic thinking, as many would believe. So you can have a hero that is cynical and pessimistic, and furthermore, ungrateful and disrespectful of what she has. She cannot see the abundance around her nor does she trust that things will work out. She is full of shame and self-punishment, and does not feel like she deserves anything good, let alone great.
This definitely fits a character-driven story well. The character could start out feeling like she is at a low point in her life, only to find that things got a lot lower later on and that her life wasn’t as bad as she thought at that time. She realizes that she should have been grateful for what she had.
This can also work for a romantic relationship: Maybe the heroine doesn’t appreciate her partner, and then her partner is gone and she realizes she didn’t respect the relationship or the person, and she wasn’t grateful for the things that he did for her. She didn’t see the abundant love and possibility that was right in front of her. She didn’t trust that things could get better if she had worked on them. It’s the old saying about not realizing what you have until it’s gone.
Her friends could be out seizing opportunities and she could be pushed away by being so negative about every step that they are taking to the point where they don’t want to be around her anymore.
