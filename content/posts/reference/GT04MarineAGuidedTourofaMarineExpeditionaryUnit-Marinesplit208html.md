Marine
Aboard the USS Germantown (LSD-42), 1513 Hours, September 10th, 2008
When the F/A-18s had continued on a course that looked like a classic attack profile, the ARG commander had given orders that enabled the fire-control computers to engage as soon as hostile aircraft came within weapons range. But no one could have predicted that one F/A-18 pilot was crazy enough to close to strafing range at wave-top level, and no one could have predicted how badly a long burst of 20mm shells could shred the bridge of an amphibious transport. It did the young Hornet pilot little good in any case. One of the Germantown's 20mm Mk 16 Phalanx CIWS mounts shattered the F/A-18, sending it careening into the sea, killing the pilot.
