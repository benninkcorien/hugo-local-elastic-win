A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
You could have a character who decides she likes the chaos. Some people really do like drama and craziness because they grew up with it and it’s all they know. Some people are uncomfortable with peace and quiet—they crave the jolts of adrenalin an unstable environment provides.
People who take a lot of risks, such as skydiving, crave that feeling of rushing adrenalin. They have a lot of trouble sitting still. The twist might be that the heroine comes to the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with her, that she does not actually desire peace and quiet after all. She understands that she has a little too much drama in her life and it’s not healthy, but the idea of peace and quiet and being present all the time is not necessarily what she wants after all. She makes the decision from a healthy place, so she knows it’s the right one. And that could be the twist.
Whatever the outcome or decision is, the heroine experiences a renewed sense of energy and feeling okay with her life. She either achieves the peace and quiet or she discovers that she’s okay with not being that way. She is comfortable and has achieved a sense of joy on her own terms.
