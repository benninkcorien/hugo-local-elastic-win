EMOTION: ANXIETY
EMOTION: ANXIETY
Quote: “An author should know their character intimately, they should know their history, how they would react in any situation, they should know their look and mannerisms down to the smallest facial tick.” —author and blogger, Aaron Miles
The easiest way to convey to a reader, without stating the emotion, whenever a character is feeling nervous or anxious, is to describe the character’s body language. Since describing the body’s movements and gestures can show readers what a character is feeling, it is often worthwhile to stay in Deeper POV.
For example, a character that is feeling anxious or worried might be described as defensive because they are subconsciously protecting themselves. Or a writer can show a character whose tense or apprehensive sitting on the edge of a seat, along with rapid foot tapping. Shifting weight from foot-to-foot or constant movement can describe a character that appears uncomfortable without stating it.
A nervous or anxious character might make bad decisions or cause tension for the hero. For this type of character, anxiety might not just be an isolated emotion, but rather a whole collection of real or imagined fears. The character might overreact because they perceive a threat, causing a fight-or-flight stress reaction.
Some physical signs of apprehension might be:
Men stand with their hands clutched in front of their genitals
Women fold their arms across their chest
Increased heart rate
Inability to breathe deeply
Tugging at collar
Rigid muscles
Clenched jaw
Restless / unable to sit still
Sweaty Palms
Trembling hands
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I felt nervous going to the party alone.
DEEP POV: My jaw clenched as I neared the door of the party. Man, I hated going places alone.
SHALLOW: He hated confrontations and he was anxious to face Adam.
DEEP POV: Rolling his neck and shoulders, he faced Adam.
SHALLOW: “Where is Becky?” I asked nervously.
DEEP POV: “W-where is Bbbecky?” I stammered.
SHALLOW: She was agitated and angry that he came home so late.
DEEP POV: She stood with her arms crossed and her foot tapping. “Where the hell have you been?” she demanded.
SHALLOW: I was feeling anxious about the long drive home on the winding road.
DEEP POV: My fingers gripped the steering wheel tightly, my gaze glued to windy road.
SHALLOW: Manny was flustered while waiting for his wife to give birth.
DEEP POV: Manny was jiggling his keys and pacing the hospital waiting room.
SHALLOW: I felt apprehensive and fearful about giving the speech.
DEEP POV:  Shaking out my hands and arms, I cleared my throat several times and said, “Hello, I’m Daisy Price…”
SHALLOW: Mercy was rattled and she looked agitated.
DEEP POV: Mercy clutched her handbag to her chest like a shield.
SHALLOW: I feel apprehensive.
DEEP POV: My mouth went dry and my hands were trembling.
SHALLOW: He felt very uneasy and restless today.
DEEP POV: With sweaty hands, he tugged at his collar.
I have included a few longer examples to further illustrate my point. The first is written in Shallow POV with too many “ly” adverbs tacked onto the dialogue tags, and the speech is lacking “voice.” (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing in the first example.)
Please carefully examine these scenes…
SHALLOW (info-dump): 
“Do you have any questions?” Lily asked, feeling apprehensive.
The place in the forest where they’d followed the werewolves felt cold and damp. She noticed an intent look on William’s face.
“There are really werewolves? And other supernatural creatures?” William asked nervously.
Lily nodded her head in agreement, although she felt anxious. “Yes, Except for some paranormal things,” she said seriously.
“You should not have followed us,” Jack said sternly, wearing an angry expression.
“Do you hunt werewolves?” William asked with eagerness.
“I only do when they attack innocent people,” Jack answered honestly.
William looked thoughtful while contemplating how this news would change his world. This is weird, he thought. But so cool.
Lily was worried. She leaned forward anxiously, and touched William’s hand. “Is this information upsetting you?”
“That is marvelous,” he said with a glimmer of excitement in his eyes.
Jack looked startled. “Did you say marvelous?”
William nodded enthusiastically and it made the dark hair move on his forehead. He was delighted to know that paranormal creatures were real.  “Yes, I did. It’s like Supernatural, but real.”
Jack felt nervous and anxious by William’s response. “What are you talking about?”
“That is a TV show,” Lily explained. She felt embarrassed. “On the TV show they mention a lot of paranormal occurrences.”
Jack shook his head in disbelief.
William grinned with amusement. “You’ve never heard of Supernatural?”
“I have heard the word supernatural,” Jack said thoughtfully. “And vampires, however, they have mostly died out.”
William looked disappointed. “Vampires are extinct? That is too bad.”
Wasn’t that tedious and boring to read? Why, yes. Yes, it was!
Now this second example has been revised into Deeper POV. The scene includes a few of the five senses and “voice” both in the dialogue and internal-thoughts, along with descriptive details.
DEEP POV: 
Lily chewed on her bottom lip. “Any questions?”
The cave in the forest where they’d tracked the werewolves had damp walls and an eerie coldness that seemed to penetrate her heavy jacket. She shivered and moved closer to Jack. At least the mutts had vacated their den for the night.
Jack sighed. “He shouldn’t have followed us here.”
“Why not?” William’s eyes grew wide. “Are there really werewolves? Demons, witches, and other supernatural creatures?”
Lily scratched her head, then slowly nodded. “All true. Except for trolls and unicorns. Those are myths.”
“So, you hunt werewolves?” William turned to Lily’s new boyfriend Jack and a goofy smile spread his lips. “Like it’s your job?”
Jack laced his fingers behind his head and leaned back on his heels. “Yes, but only when they attack innocents.”
William grew quiet and stared down at his feet. A chilly wind swept through the space, stirring up the pine needles. A pair of fireflies danced at the mouth of the cave.
Lily leaned forward, and lightly touched William’s hand. “Are you okay? I mean, are you freaking out?”
William lifted his head and a slow grin overtook his features. “No…this is awesome.”
The dark lashes gracing Jack’s cheeks flew up. “Did you say awesome?”
Rubbing his hands together, William nodded, making the dark hair bounce on his forehead. “Yup. It’s like Supernatural, but real.”
The lines crisscrossing Jack’s forehead deepened. “What are you talking about?”
“That’s a TV show.” Lily’s face colored fiercely. “On the series, there are hunters and it has a lot of monsters, like vampires.”
Jack just stared at William.
William grinned. “You’ve never heard of Supernatural?”
“I’ve heard of the word supernatural,” Jack said in a serious tone. “And vampires. Even though, they’ve mostly died out.”
William’s smile drooped. “Vampires are extinct? That sucks. No pun intended…”
***
Just remind yourself that showing respects the reader’s intelligence, and telling assumes that the reader is not clever enough to recognize the emotion or reaction unless the writer blatantly states it for them.
