A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE ARTIST
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two archetypes are similar in that they are both attuned to other people’s feelings, and they are both practiced in expressing emotion. The Woman’s Man is more focused on romantic love, however, and the Artist’s interest is transcendental/artistic love.
While the Artist wants women in his life some of the time, the Woman’s Man needs women in his life all of the time. This is something the Artist will never understand. He is attached to one project/painting at a time, and when it’s finished he finds it easy to let it go. He sometimes wears his loneliness on his sleeve and uses it to fuel his art.
The Woman’s Man can teach the Artist to play and to lighten up about his artistic endeavors. The Artist can teach the Woman’s Man to create something of value and to see a project through to the end rather than leaving every time things get rough.
