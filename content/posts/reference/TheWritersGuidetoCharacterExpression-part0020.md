SHALLOW: INDIFFERENCE
SHALLOW: INDIFFERENCE
Quote: “Truly emotionless characters are tricky to pull off because outside of programming, brainwashing, and curses, you can’t really have motivation or conflict without emotion. Even a truly evil villain, hellbent on destruction, is probably motivated by hate, fear, greed, or disgust. That said, indifference will be easier to work with, because the emotion can be there and just muted or very well hidden...” —anonymous, Writing Questions Answered blog
Indifference is an emotion or a forced reaction that a character might use to hide their true feelings. It can mean a lack of concern, boredom, disinterest, apathy, or nonchalance in any given situation. To add an extra layer of depth to the characterization, a writer could have one character who is compassionate and generous, and another who is indifferent and detached. This can add some great conflict and tension whenever these two diverse characters are on the same page together.
An indifferent character might actually be trying to disguise a deep hurt or emotional scar, so they pretend not to care and appear detached, flippant, and even sarcastic. This type of complex character might even be an outsider or recluse, who believes no one else will understand their pain or circumstances.
For instance, in a romance novel, a character that is cynical and indifferent (makes a good character growth ARC) might be protecting themselves by keeping the love interest at arm’s length or closing off their heart to avoid getting hurt.
Some shallow words for indifference or boredom can be glazed, tortured, listless, detached, remote, etc. but these weak visualizes should be revised whenever possible with Deeper POV.
Signs of indifference might be:
Yawning loudly
Half-open eyelids
Rolling eyes
Shrugging shoulders
Sighing heavily
Limp posture / relaxed muscles
Head down or held in hands
Slouching in a seat or slumping in chair
Waving hand in the air dismissively
Glance up at the ceiling
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I was bored listening to his stories at summer camp. They were so monotonous that I didn’t listen.
DEEP POV: With my lips compressed, I slouched lower in my seat and ignored him.
SHALLOW: She felt detached from the lecture her mother gave and said, “I don’t care.”
DEEP POV: Her eyes rolled up. “Whatever.”
SHALLOW: His expression looked bored.
DEEP POV: He yawned and closed his eyes.
SHALLOW: Tara was bored of answering questions.
DEEP POV: With a loud yawn, Tara said, “Well, I don’t know.”
SHALLOW: I didn’t have time for a lecture on driving too fast.
DEEP POV: I crossed my legs and folded my arms. “Get to the point.”
SHALLOW: Erin felt detached from the conversation and said in a dull voice, “I do not want to hear anymore.”
DEEP POV: Erin sagged in his seat and sighed heavily. “I’ve heard enough.”
SHALLOW: Lisa talked about her new boyfriend and I found it boring to listen to.
DEEP POV: I blinked, trying to keep my eyes open and not fall asleep while Lisa droned on about her new boyfriend.
SHALLOW: He thought the movie was dreary and mind-numbing. “I’m bored to tears,” he said in an uninterested voice.
DEEP POV: His head fell back against the seat and he stared at the theater ceiling. “If I have to watch any more of this nonsense, I’m going to shoot myself.”
SHALLOW: Billy looked at the wall while I was talking and I thought it was rude.
DEEP POV: Billy seemed to be spacing out, so I grabbed his arm and gave it a shake. “Don’t tune me out again.”

The following two examples demonstrate first what your sentences might look like with an annoying, visible narrator telling the story, and then what the writing might look like without the narrator.
Please closely examine these two scenes…
SHALLOW: 
The long car ride to Aunt Jenny’s house was uninteresting. There was nothing to do, but look out the window at the trees and houses and other cars. I was so bored that I thought about taking a nap. But then my dad tried to talk to me about school, but that was a dull subject.
I tried changing the radio station to hear some better music yet I couldn’t find anything to fight the boredom, so got out my phone and texted my friend.
DEEP POV: 
This had to be the longest car ride ever. Not much to do, but gaze out the window at the passing cars, and count the number of houses and trees whizzing by. When that become mind-numbing, I sighed and closed my eyes.
“How’s that advanced math class you’re taking this semester?” my dad asked.
“Fine,” I said, opening my eyes. There goes my nap. “And the semester’s over.”
My dad glanced at me. “What about that art class—”
“Why don’t we listen to some tunes,” I suggested, changing the subject. I was seriously burned out on talking about school.
I switched radio stations until that proved futile. Only static or uninteresting talk shows, which equaled yawn-fest. I whipped out my cell phone and texted my best friend. She always had amusing stories that would help the time go by faster.

As you start to revise your own stories, remember that it is easy to inadvertently violate the show, don’t tell principle when you’re writing early drafts.
