A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 4MALE INTERACTIONS
In this section you will learn how the male archetypes interact with each other. Not only will this help when you create supporting characters, it will also assist when you create ensemble pieces. Supporting characters may have their own archetype, depending on how involved they are in the story.
In some cases you will notice that an ability or aspect of an archetype is so strong that no matter who he’s paired with, he teaches the same thing. That’s okay. It just shows how strong an influence this aspect of his archetype can be on the others.
The following pages show you how every male archetype interacts with every other male archetype. No matter how many main characters you have, you will be able to figure out how they fit together.
Understand that if your story is mainly about the plot and not the characters, you may want to go with archetypes that get along easily. Many cop buddy films feature two cops who are different in personality but similar in archetypes. They are both cops out to do the right thing and save the day.
