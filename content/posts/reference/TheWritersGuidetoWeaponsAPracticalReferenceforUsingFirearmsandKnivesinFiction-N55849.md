Acknowledgments, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Acknowledgments
Excluding anyone from recognition is a sin, but there isn’t enough space to list the many writers of fiction and nonfiction upon whose shoulders I stood to write this guide. However, a few people deserve special mention for their assistance with this work.
Exceptional gratitude goes to Corey Graff, James Card, Joe Kertzman, and Steve Shackleford for their time and effort as fact-checkers.
Vast libraries of information helped produce the technical side of this guide. Thanks to the teams at Gun Digest, BLADE, Living Ready, Deer & Deer Hunting, Turkey & Turkey Hunting, and Trapper & Predator Caller for the cumulative centuries’ worth of knowledge. Thank you also for the guidance during my tenure at F+W. To James Duncan and Rachel Randall, my editors, thank you for bringing out the best in this guide. To Phil Sexton, the publisher at Writer’s Digest, goes my appreciation for believing in my crazy ideas in the first place.
I must also recognize my family. This guide is a testament to the firearm, knife, and outdoors knowledge they’ve passed down.
I saved the best for last: Thank you to Meredith, for the times you left me alone to write and for the times you didn’t.
