A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
The Muppet Movie
A young boy who feels different from everyone around him finds a TV show of Muppets and realizes he is just like them. His dream of visiting the Muppets in Hollywood comes true. He goes on a journey with the Muppets and along the way learns to like himself.
X-men
The X-men series is ultimately about being different in a society that can just as easily vilify differences as reward them. The X-men wind up creating their own community and school so they can feel normal and accepted in their own way.
The King’s Speech
King George VI, who suffered a severe speech impediment, had to “man up” and become a good public speaker after his father died and his brother abdicated the throne. He pursued a cure and ended up embracing himself in this new role. “Because I have a right to be heard. I have a voice!”
