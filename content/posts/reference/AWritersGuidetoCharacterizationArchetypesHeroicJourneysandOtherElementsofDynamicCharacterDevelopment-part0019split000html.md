A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 13THE FOXCLEVERNESS & RESOURCEFULNESS
“The Fox’s ability to meld into one’s surroundings and be unnoticed is a powerful gift when one is observing the activities of others. This allows it to be the protector of the family unit.” —Sandy Pounce
Much truth lies within the expression “clever like a fox.” Foxes are known to be able to hide very well by camouflaging themselves and can adapt to any kind of situation in a very clever way. Most animals run in a straight line when chased by a predator. But when a predator chases a fox, the fox will decide (when the moment feels right) to double back on its trail and run in circles. Doing so makes it very difficult for the predator to determine which direction the fox went. It will seem like the trail just ends and disappears. Then the fox can hide very easily to confuse the predator.
The fox is resourceful and clever. He is prone to thinking and behaving differently, and he approaches difficult situations from a perspective that doesn’t occur to most others. The Fox’s unexpected action might be shocking, or even seemingly stupid, but it usually works out.
