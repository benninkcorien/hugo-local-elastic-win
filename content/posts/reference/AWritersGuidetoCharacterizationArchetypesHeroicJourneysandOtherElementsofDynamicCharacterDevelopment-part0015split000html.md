A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 9THE COUGARASSERTIVENESS & MASTERY
“Often times, Cougar ‘people’ face issues and examples of what true power is and what it isn’t. True power is never about trying to have power over someone else. Power and owning one’s power means one accepts responsibility for one’s choices and actions, one accepts that every action one takes leads to consequences that may be positive or negative. —Lynx Graywolf
Cougars are very good at using their resources. They only move when they are sure it’s a good time to take action. They watch and study what’s going on around them and wait for the right time to make a move. They don’t waste a lot of energy and time in the faulty pursuits or in moves in the wrong direction.
They know what needs to be done. They’ve figured everything out ahead of time. They have weighed their options, and they are ready to make a move. They are waiting for that right moment to come, and they will pounce on that opportunity.
This lesson is about a focused, readied, skilled, knowledgeable attack. It is similar to going to war—the troops are just waiting for their superiors to give the go-ahead so they can move forward. It’s about the external part of getting ready to react because everything is aligned and ready to go. They’re just waiting for the opportunity.
The hero in this case is starting from a place of power. He may be getting bullied but he already has within him the strength to deal with it. He just may need a little push in asserting himself.
Assertiveness is about being centered in what you know is best and speaking up. It is not about being a bully or pushing your weight around. It’s about having confidence and doing what you think is right in the situation you are facing.
