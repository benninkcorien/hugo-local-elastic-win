A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
REMEMBER—JOBS THAT ARE AGAINST TYPE
It’s not mandatory that an archetype hold one of the jobs specified in his category. In fact, if you mix and match the jobs, you create a potential for comedy. Watch the films Mr. Mom or Kindergarten Cop as examples of going against job type.
In Mr. Mom Michael Keaton is a man who stays home to care for the kids when his wife finds a job. In Kindergarten Cop Arnold Schwarzenneger plays a tough cop who is forced to teach kindergarten.
Once you understand what jobs are suited for each archetype you can then make better choices about your hero’s occupation and how it will fit into your story.
