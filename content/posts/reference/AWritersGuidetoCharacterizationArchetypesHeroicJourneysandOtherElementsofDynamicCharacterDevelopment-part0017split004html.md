A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Other characters might be put off by this lesson because it’s hard for anybody in modern society to keep their innocence and generosity, especially those who live in the city. City folks assume that people who let their guard down are simply asking someone to take advantage of them.
It’s possible to remain aware and stay true to who you are in spite of what happens around you. You can continue to be somewhat innocent and gentle, but you’ll need to protect yourself. That means staying attuned to what’s going on around you in the present moment, hearing what’s not being said, and using your peripheral vision so you can be aware of your surroundings.
It’s not about being on alert or being hypervigilant. The aim is to achieve a relaxing presence that honors your gut instincts and intuition, and does not allow whatever is going on around you to change the core of who you are. Many of us struggle with this.
A story of a Zen student illustrates this lesson well. The Zen student is being harassed by a man on the street. One day she takes her umbrella and hits him over the head. Then she notices that her Zen teacher is watching from across the street. She apologizes to the teacher and asks what she should do about the situation. He replies, “Next time, gather a lot of love in your heart and hit him over the head.” This means that if you have the right intention when defending yourself, it is acceptable to do whatever you see fit. The teacher goes on to say that the man who harassed the student also needs a lesson.
