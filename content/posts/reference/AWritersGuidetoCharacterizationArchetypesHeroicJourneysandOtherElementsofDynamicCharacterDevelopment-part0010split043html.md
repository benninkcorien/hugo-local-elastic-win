A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE MAIDEN
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. This is not the Maiden’s specialty. She needs to work on being responsible too, but that’s because she acts ‘young,’ not because she’s trying to live outside of society’s rules.
She is also very spontaneous and adventurous at times and he may not see her as much of a project unless she has low self-esteem.
She must learn to stand on her own two feet. The Woman’s Man can help her with this, encouraging her to be independent and pointing out all her good qualities. He’s a real self-esteem booster.
They won’t necessarily be there for each other physically. He will be off playing the field, and so will she. But they can meet on an emotional level. They both share the same experiences and have a hard time fitting in with ‘normal’ society.
They can both feel validated and renewed when together, but they also will likely be bored. He may not be able to teach her much, and she knows he isn’t the marrying kind who will take care of her, which is what she really wants.
