Glossary, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Glossary
Action: The mechanism that moves ammunition in and out of a firearm’s chamber (the place where a cartridge is seated to be fired).
Ankle holster: A type of handgun holster worn around the ankle, usually underneath a pant leg.
Armor-piercing ammunition: A type of ammunition that has a bullet that is either coated in Teflon, made of hardened metals, or both. Whether such a bullet actually penetrates armor depends on many factors.
Assault rifle: Not to be confused with assault weapon. As Patrick Sweeney writes in The Gun Digest Book of the AK & SKS, an assault rifle is “a shoulder-fired, select-fire weapon used by an individual soldier, firing a cartridge of intermediate rifle caliber, with a detachable, high-capacity magazine.” Select-fire means the rifle can switch between fully automatic and semi-automatic modes.
Assault weapon: A consistent definition does not exist for this term. Federal, state, and local laws each define it differently, and each of those definitions changes with the times. Use tactical rifle, automatic rifle, machine gun, submachine gun, assault rifle (see its separate entry for the distinction), or something generic (or brand specific) instead.
Assisted opening knife: This knife has a swinging blade concealed inside the handle that is biased to stay put. It is opened when the operator pushes on a thumb stud, disc, hole, or tab connected to the blade. At about halfway open, a spring or torsion bar in the knife “assists” the blade into its open position. Not to be used interchangeably with switchblade.
Automatic knife: Another term for switchblade, but in the modern sense. It’s more accurate to use automatic knife when referring to switchblades used by law enforcement and military characters after 1958. Automatic knives are built with the latest materials and technology and are designed for hard use. Some open from the side like a traditional switchblade. Others open and close from the front. Those are called OTF (out the front) knives.
Auto lock holster: A type of pistol holster that uses a locking mechanism to secure the firearm. It must be unlocked, usually by pressing with a thumb, in order for the firearm to be drawn. Not used with revolvers.
Back sheath: A type of knife sheath worn across the back, usually secured to the shoulder.
Balisong knife: Another term for butterfly knife. The plural form may be written as balisongs. Bali-Song is a registered trademark of Benchmade, so don’t spell it that way unless referring specifically to those knives.
Ballistic knife: A device, usually homemade, that launches a knife or sharp object from a cylinder. Often restricted by state or local laws.
Ballistics: The science of how a bullet or other projectile travels.
BBs: Spherical projectiles of lead, steel, or other metal inside a shotshell. Not to be used interchangeably with bullets.
Blood grooves: Also called fullers. Despite their name, these long indentations along a knife’s blade aren’t actually used for channeling blood from a wound. They don’t make it easier to remove the blade from a body, either. They reduce the weight of the blade. That’s about it. Knife designers use them to achieve a certain balance or look.
Bolt-action rifle: A rifle that uses a sliding metal cylinder (bolt) to move shells in and out of the chamber. The shooter manually operates the bolt to cycle ammunition. The rifle can’t fire unless the bolt is in a forward-down position, even if the safety is off.
Boot knife: A short, slender fixed blade knife. Despite the name, it’s not always carried in a boot. This is a style of knife.
Boot sheath: A type of knife sheath designed for securing inside footwear, usually but not always a boot.
Bowie knife: A style of fixed blade knife popularized by Jim Bowie and the infamous Sandbar Fight of 1827. A Bowie knife is characterized by a large blade whose tip is lower than the top of the handle, as if part of the spine had been clipped out. This is referred to as a clip point. One person or company does not own this design—it’s just a style.
Break-action: A kind of hinged firearm mechanism that opens with a lever or release to expose the chamber. The operator places shells directly into the chamber, then closes the action to fire. Emptying the chamber involves reopening the action and manually removing the shells. This type of action is most common with single-shot and double-barrel shotguns.
Buck knife: When written as buck knife, it’s a generic term for any hunting knife. A Buck knife is different. Buck is a brand that makes many kinds of knives. It’s more accurate to write hunting knife unless specifically referring to knives made by Buck or the iconic Buck 110 knife.
Buckshot: Another term for 00 shot or double-ought shot. It’s a shotshell with large BBs. It’s usually restricted for civilian use by law and most commonly used for defense purposes.
Bullet: A single metal projectile seated at the top of a cartridge. Not to be used interchangeably with cartridge, round, or shell. It’s just the projectile.
Bullpup: Not a dog at all. This is a type of rifle or shotgun where the action and magazine are positioned behind the trigger instead of in front of it. This makes for a compact design without sacrificing performance.
Butterfly knife: Another term for balisong. This is a knife that contains a blade nestled between two handle halves. The handles are hinged into the tang of the blade. In its closed position, none of the blade is exposed. Swinging open one of the handle halves 360 degrees until it meets the other handle half exposes the blade.
Carbine: A small or light rifle.
Cartridge: Another term for shell or round, cartridge applies to rifle and handgun ammunition. It’s technically accurate, but not common, to use this term for shotgun ammunition, too, but it is not to be used interchangeably with bullet. A cartridge contains the casing, primer, gunpowder, and projectile(s). It’s the whole thing.
Casing/Case: A component of a rifle, handgun, or shotgun shell. This guide considers casing the preferred term. For rifles and handguns, a casing is the metal sleeve (usually brass) that houses gunpowder and a primer. The bullet is seated at the top of the casing. For shotguns, the casing is usually plastic and wraps up all the interior components.
Castle Doctrine: Under this principle, a person has no obligation to retreat when threatened at home. A lethal act of violence to stop a threat would therefore be justified.
Centerfire ammunition: A rifle, handgun, or shotgun shell designed for a firing pin to strike the center of the primer. This is different from rimfire ammunition, where the firing pin strikes the rim of the casing. The more powerful varieties of rifle and handgun ammunition are almost always centerfire. Lighter calibers, such as the .17 and .22, are rimfire. Shotgun shells are almost always centerfire.
Chamber: The spot at the base of the barrel where a shell is seated to be fired.
Charging handle: Sometimes called a cocking handle. With regard to semi-automatic or fully automatic shotguns and rifles, it’s a small tab or knob located near the chamber. The shooter works the cocking handle back to chamber the first shell, then activates a release or lets go so the handle snaps forward. The shell is ready to be fired.
Choke: A replaceable, legal modification screwed into the end of a shotgun barrel. It changes the pattern of BBs as they exit the barrel. A permanent choke could also be carved out of the inside of the barrel. This is called a jug choke.
Clip: A term often used incorrectly in place of detachable magazine. A clip seats ammunition together for insertion into the magazine of a firearm. Clips are most often used with older firearms. In nearly all cases, use magazine instead of clip.
Close range: Referring to firearms, a distance typically less than 25 yards.
Cocked: In all instances, cocked means the firearm is mechanically ready to fire with the pull of the trigger. With firearms that have hammers, cocked means the hammer is back.
Cocking handle: See charging handle.
Collapsible stock: A feature most often associated with semi-automatic or fully automatic rifles, although they could be fitted to any long firearm. Collapsible stocks fold or slide to adjust the length of that part of the firearm.
Concealed carry: The act of a person hiding a firearm on his or her body. It almost always involves a handgun inside a holster obstructed from view.
Cop-killer ammunition: A vague term referring either to Teflon-coated bullets designed to penetrate body armor or to hollow-point ammunition. Neither is all that accurate. It’s best to avoid this term.
Cordite: A type of gunpowder used in firearms from the late 1800s to World War II. Cordite is now obsolete.
Cross draw: When referring to handgun holsters, this is when the holster is not on the shooter’s strong side. For example, a cross draw holster for a right-handed person would be on the left side.
Crosshairs: The type of scope reticle most commonly found in fiction. It contains two intersecting lines in a cross or plus-sign shape. Some variants include features for ranging.
Cutlery: Knives used in the kitchen to prep food or for eating. It’s redundant to write kitchen cutlery.
Cutthroat razor: Another term for straight razor. It features a shaving blade that folds into a handle.
Custom firearm: A firearm customized using manufactured parts and accessories.
Derringer: A generic term for a small pistol.
Dagger: A type of knife that is smaller than a short sword and has a blade that is sharpened on both sides. Designed for stabbing or forward-motion work.
Double-action handgun: A type of handgun where one pull of the trigger makes the internal or external hammer perform two motions: back (cocked) and forward (firing pin strikes shell). Most modern revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are double-action. The shooter can pull the trigger without cocking a hammer first.
Double triggers: A pair of triggers sometimes found on double-barrel shotguns. Each trigger fires a separate barrel.
Drop: In terms of ballistics, it’s the distance a projectile, such as a bullet, descends as it travels.
Drum: A large, pancake-shaped magazine usually associated with submachine guns and machine guns. It rotates cartridges in a circular pattern through the action. Picture a Tommy gun from the Prohibition era.
Edge: The cutting side of a blade. It’s what gets sharpened.
Everyday carry knife: A knife designed for carrying in the pocket every day. Designs focus on general utility tasks (opening mail, cutting common materials, etc.) and eye appeal. Often abbreviated as EDC.
Extended magazine: Referring to shotguns, it’s an extra-long tube magazine for carrying additional shells. For pistols and rifles, it’s a magazine (not a clip) that holds many more rounds than is standard.
Extreme range: Referring to firearms, it’s a distance between about 300 to 2,000 yards.
Fillet knife: A knife with a thin, flexible blade useful for removing skin from meat. Most often used to process fish, but writers may have more nefarious purposes in mind.
Firing pin: The device in a firearm that strikes the primer in a shell. The primer then ignites the gunpowder, which forces the projectile(s) out the barrel.
Fixed blade knife: A knife with an immobile blade seated over a handle. The most popular kind of knife.
Fixed cylinder revolver: A type of revolver where shells are loaded and unloaded by slipping them in and out of exposed chambers along the side of the firearm. Most common with antique revolvers.
Folding knife: A knife with one or more blades that fold in and out of the handle. The operator moves the blades manually. Pocketknife is another term for folding knife.
Fully automatic rifle: A rifle where more than one round will fire so long as the trigger is pulled. Also called a machine gun. Acceptable to use full-auto in place of the lengthier term.
Don’t confuse this with a semi-automatic rifle. Those fire only once per pull of the trigger.
Full metal jacket: A type of handgun or rifle ammunition where the bullet is covered in a layer of hard metal. This makes the bullet more likely to pass through a target.
Gauge: Shotguns are classified by gauge. The lower the gauge, the more powerful the shotgun. The most popular shotguns are 12-gauge and 20-gauge. Note that the .410 shotgun refers to a caliber, not a gauge.
Ginsu knife: This term is sometimes used in place of chef’s knife or butcher knife. Ginsu is a brand. It’s more accurate to use generic terms unless you’re referring specifically to that brand of knife.
Grains: A unit of measurement used for firearm ammunition, such as bullets, slugs, and gunpowder. One grain is equivalent to 64.79 milligrams. One ounce is equal to 437.5 grains. Grains is also used in this guide to denote a property of metal in knife blades. That’s a separate usage.
Gut hook: A curved tool for cutting open animals for processing. Gut hooks are either stand-alone tools or a part built into knives.
Gunpowder: The propellant that launches a projectile out of a firearm. Modern gunpowder does not contain cordite.
Hammer: A lever located behind the chamber of a firearm that sets and resets the firing pin. They can be internal or external.
Hammerless revolver: A type of revolver that lacks an external hammer.
Hip holsters: A type of handgun holster that is attached to a belt around the waist.
Hollow-point bullets: A type of rifle or handgun bullet sporting a crater instead of a tip. This design makes the bullet explode upon impact. Hollow-point ammunition is not likely to pass through a target.
Hunting knife: A knife designed for outdoor activities.
IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster: A type of hip holster designed for wearing on the inside of pants around the waist. Ideal for concealed carry.
IWB (inside-the-waistband) sheath: A type of knife sheath attached to the waist designed to slip inside the pants instead of outside.
Italian stiletto: When most people think of a switchblade, they’re imagining the long, thin profile of an Italian stiletto.
Karambit: A style of tactical knife with a curved blade and handle. The knife in its entirety makes somewhat of a C shape.
Kukri: A type of knife with a blade that curves inward like a boomerang and is ideal for hacking and slashing. The design is indigenous to Nepal and surrounding areas. Also spelled as khukri and about a dozen other ways. Pick one and be consistent.
Laser sights: A glorified laser pointer attached to a firearm useful for aiming at close ranges. The most popular are red, but green is another option. Not to be confused with red dot sights or scopes.
Lever-action: A type of firearm action that uses a manual lever to simultaneously eject a shell from the chamber and load a round from a tubular magazine beneath the barrel. This is most common with older-style rifles.
Lock: A mechanism that keeps the blade in place after it opens from inside the handle of a knife. Commonly found on pocketknives, folding knives, automatic knives, switchblades, and assisted opening knives.
Long range: Referring to firearms, it’s a distance between 100 and 300 yards.
Machete: A type of oversized fixed blade knife designed for slashing and hacking.
Machine gun: A fully automatic firearm that uses rifle ammunition. This is different from a submachine gun, which is generally smaller and shoots handgun ammunition. Fully automatic rifle, automatic rifle, and tactical rifle are appropriate synonyms. See the separate entry on assault rifles for how to use that term.
Machine pistol: A submachine gun that’s closer in size to a handgun than a rifle.
Magazine: A firearm component that stores shells in reserve until fed into the chamber to be fired. A magazine can be detachable or built into the firearm. If it’s detachable, don’t confuse it with the term clip. A clip seats shells together for insertion into a magazine. However, most magazines don’t require separate clips. With shotguns, the magazine is the tube holding reserve shells underneath the barrel. With pistols, the magazine is usually detachable and located inside the handle. A revolver does not have a magazine. It has a cylinder that contains separate chambers. Rifles could have an internal magazine or a detachable magazine depending on the model. Machine guns and submachine guns use detachable magazines. Because of their large capacity, magazines may require clips to replenish them. Just stick to the term magazine unless getting technical in this area makes sense. Mag is an abbreviated form of this term.
Magnum: Magnum ammunition contains extra gunpowder and/or a larger projectile. It is therefore more powerful than regular ammunition. There isn’t a set industry definition, though. Manufacturers set their own standards for what qualifies as magnum. With shotshells, magnum ammunition may also contain extra BBs.
Midrange: Referring to firearms, a distance between about 25 and 100 yards.
Moon clip: Similar to a speed loader, except it’s a thin frame that holds shells together for insertion into the chambers of a revolver. It’s best to use moon clip instead of just clip, since clip is misused so often.
MOLLE: Stands for “modular lightweight load-carrying equipment.” It’s a customizable harness used by military and law enforcement organizations for carrying tactical gear, such as pouches, sheaths, and holsters. Available on the civilian market, too.
Mouse gun: A handgun of exceptionally small size.
Muzzle: The end of the barrel where projectiles exit the firearm.
Neck sheath: A type of knife sheath with a lanyard for wearing around the neck.
Open carry: The act of carrying a firearm in full view. It’s basically the opposite of concealed carry.
OTF (out the front) knife: A type of automatic knife. Blades open and close from the front of the knife handle instead of the side.
Over-under: A type of firearm, usually a double-barrel shotgun, where two barrels are stacked vertically.
Pattern: The cloud of BBs that exits the barrel of a shotgun.
Pistol: A handgun that uses a stationary chamber. Not the same as a revolver, which uses several chambers inside a rotating cylinder.
Pocket clip: A metal clamp on the handle of a knife that hooks onto the top of a pocket. This makes the knife easier to carry. Pocket clips first became popular in the 1980s.
Pocket holster: A type of handgun holster designed to slip inside a pocket.
Pocket pistol: A small pistol.
Pocketknife: A knife with one or more blades that fold in and out of the side of the handle. The operator moves the blade(s) manually. Folding knife is another term for pocketknife.
Pommel: The bottom of a knife handle. Some are designed for looks, while others sport studs intended for striking opponents or breaking windows.
Primer: A component of a cartridge or shell. When struck by a firing pin, it ignites the gunpowder in the cartridge.
Projectile: In firearms, this refers to whatever is being launched out the barrel. It could be a bullet, a BB, a shotgun slug, a less-lethal item, or something else.
Propellant: Another term for gunpowder.
Pump: The back-and-forth motion that works the slide on a pump-action shotgun or pump-action rifle.
Pump-action rifle: A type of rifle where the operator pumps a sliding mechanism underneath the barrel to work the action. The backward motion ejects a shell from the chamber. The forward motion loads a shell from the magazine into the chamber.
Pump-action shotgun: A type of shotgun where the operator pumps a sliding mechanism underneath the barrel to work the action. The backward motion ejects a shell from the chamber. The forward motion loads a shell from the magazine into the chamber.
Push dagger: A type of dagger with a T-shaped handle designed for defense purposes. When the dagger is held, the operator’s hand makes a fist. Also called a punch dagger. Instead of a solid handle, it may have a hole for slipping a finger through.
Rack the slide: Pertaining to slide-action pistols, this phrase means the slide is manually pulled back and released to chamber a round from the magazine. It’s a good term to use when a character loads the first round in a semi-automatic pistol.
Red dot scope or red dot sight: A tube used for aiming, similar to a traditional scope. However, it uses a red dot instead of the classic crosshairs. If this tube magnifies the target, it’s a red dot scope. If it doesn’t, it’s a red dot sight. Not to be confused with laser sights, which project a red dot onto a target.
Rescue knives: A general term for knives with features for freeing people in survival situations. Features could include seat belt cutters, dull tips for working the blade near flesh, window breakers, LED lights, and whistles.
Reticle: Lines inside a scope used for aiming. The classic crosshairs are a type of reticle, although there are many variants.
Retention holsters: A type of handgun holster that uses a snug fit to secure the firearm. Used for both pistols and revolvers.
Revolver: A handgun that uses multiple chambers in a cylinder that rotates as the firearm is fired. Not the same thing as a pistol.
Rifled shotgun barrel: A specialized shotgun barrel with twisting grooves on the inside. These grooves cause a shotgun slug to spin as it exits the barrel, increasing its accuracy. A rifled shotgun barrel would not be used with BBs (shotshells).
Rimfire ammunition: A type of cartridge where the firing pin strikes the rim of the brass casing to ignite the gunpowder. A thinner casing is used, which can support less pressure and therefore less firepower than centerfire ammunition. Rimfire ammunition is most often used in lighter rifles and handguns, such as the .22 and .17.
Rounds: A generic term for rifle, shotgun, and handgun ammunition. Interchangeable with shells and cartridges.
Saddle: Plastic clips that hold three to five shells and that are secured to a shotgun. This is a way for shotgun users to carry extra ammunition.
Safety: A switch or button that prevents a firearm from firing. When the safety is off, the firearm can be fired.
Sawed-off shotgun: A modified shotgun with a barrel shortened to less than 18 inches.
Scope: A telescoping lens in a tube mounted on a firearm used for aiming.
Seat-belt cutter: A feature on rescue knives or tools used for quickly cutting seat belts and other material. This is usually a notch in the handle with a sharpened edge inside.
Select-fire: A type of firearm that can switch between semi-automatic and fully automatic functionality.
Semi-automatic rifle: A type of rifle where the action captures force from the recoil generated by shooting the firearm. It uses this force to simultaneously eject and load shells. These rifles fire once per trigger pull.
Semi-automatic shotgun: A type of shotgun where the action captures force from the recoil generated by shooting the firearm. It uses this force to simultaneously eject and load shells. These shotguns fire once per pull of the trigger.
Shank: An improvised knife fashioned from mundane materials. Also called a shiv.
Shell: Another term for round or cartridge of ammunition.
Shiv: A type of improvised knife made from mundane materials. Also called a shank.
Shot placement: The spot where a projectile hits a target. Good shot placement means the shooter is accurate.
Shotshells: A shotgun shell that fires BBs.
Shoulder holster: A type of handgun holster that straps to the shooter’s shoulder and positions the firearm against the ribs.
Shoulder sheath: A type of knife sheath with a harness that secures to the shoulder.
Side-by-side: A type of firearm, usually a double-barrel shotgun, where two barrels are positioned next to each other horizontally.
Sight: Hardware attached to the barrel of a firearm used for aiming. Use scope if that hardware includes a telescoping lens.
Silencer: A cylindrical modification attached to the muzzle of a firearm to muffle the sound of gunfire. The more accurate but less-known term is suppressor.
Single-action handgun: A type of handgun where the hammer must be cocked before each shot, either manually or automatically. With single-action revolvers, the hammer must be manually cocked before each shot: Cock, pull the trigger, cock, pull the trigger, etc. Single-action semi-automatic pistols are different. An external hammer must be cocked before the first shot. This is accomplished automatically when the first round is chambered by racking the slide. Subsequent shots do not need to be manually cocked: Rack the slide, pull the trigger, pull the trigger, etc.
Slide-action pistol: A type of pistol that uses a sliding mechanism above the barrel. Moving this slide works the action, which cycles shells in and out of the chamber. Manually working the action to chamber the first shell is called “racking the slide.” Most modern pistols are slide-action semi-automatics.
Slide-action rifle: Another term for pump-action rifle.
Slide-action shotgun: Another term for pump-action shotgun.
Slug: A shotgun shell that contains a single lead projectile instead of BBs. The projectile is also called a slug. It’s accurate to use slug to refer to the shell or the projectile.
Small of back holster: A type of handgun holster attached to a belt around the waist and placed at the back of the shooter.
Snubnose: A revolver with a short barrel.
Speed loader: A device that quickly drops shells into the chambers of a revolver.
Speed strip: When referring to revolvers, it’s a length of flexible material that holds ammunition in a single file line. Shells can be thumbed into the chambers two or three at a time.
Stand Your Ground laws: A blanket term for laws that extend the Castle Doctrine outside the home.
Stock: The solid part of a shotgun or rifle that is held to the shooter’s shoulder.
Stopping power: The amount of force a projectile exerts on a target upon impact.
Straight razor: A shaving blade that folds into a handle. Sometimes called a cutthroat razor.
Strong side: The side of the body with the dominant hand. The right side of the body is the strong side of a right-handed person.
Submachine gun: A fully automatic firearm that uses pistol ammunition. Not to be confused with machine guns, which use rifle ammunition.
Subsonic ammunition: Firearm ammunition designed for velocities below the speed of sound, which is 1,126 feet per second. A subsonic bullet will not break the sound barrier. When paired with a suppressor (aka silencer), this ammunition will make little noise.
Suppressor: A cylindrical modification attached to the muzzle of a firearm to muffle the sound of firing. Also called a “silencer,” though “suppressor” is technically more accurate.
Swing-out cylinder revolver: The most popular kind of revolver, in which the cylinder swings out from the handgun to the side. This allows access to the chambers for loading and unloading. It’s what most people think of when they imagine a revolver.
Switchblade: A knife where the blade concealed inside the handle is biased to open. A switch or button on the handle is pressed to release the blade. Not the same as an assisted opening knife. Modern switchblades are called automatic knives. They are made for members of law enforcement and military organizations, as well as civilians where legal.
Tactical knife: A knife with features suitable for military, defensive, or first responder purposes.
Tactical rifle: A more accurate term for assault weapon. Tactical rifles contain features useful for engaging in combat.
Tactical shotgun: A shotgun with features suitable for use in combat or defensive scenarios.
Tang: An extension of the blade that runs into the inside of the handle of a knife. It offsets pressure in the blade during use. Long (or full) tangs, such as the ones often used in fixed blade knives, are better for hard use than the short or absent tangs common to knives with blades that fold out of a handle.
Terry Stop: When a law enforcement officer conducts a limited search of a person’s clothing on the suspicion that he or she has a weapon.
Thigh holsters: A type of handgun holster secured to the thigh for wearing inside or outside clothing.
Throwing knife: A fixed blade knife designed for throwing at targets.
Throwing spikes: A spike designed for throwing at targets.
Toggle-lock action: A type of semi-automatic pistol action. It uses arms and levers to capture the force from recoil to move shells in and out of the chamber. It is more common with older pistols.
Tommy gun: When people picture a submachine gun from the Prohibition era, they’re likely picturing a Tommy gun. It has a fully automatic action and sometimes uses high-capacity magazines. Tommy is short for Thompson, the last name of its inventor.
Top break revolver: A type of revolver in which the cylinder sits on a hinge. It can be tipped forward to access the chambers. This is more common with older revolvers.
Trajectory: The path a bullet or other projectile travels.
Trigger safety: A small tab on the trigger that must be pressed before the trigger can be pulled.
Wad: A component of a shotshell that seats BBs inside the cartridge.
Zip gun: An improvised firearm assembled using mundane objects.
