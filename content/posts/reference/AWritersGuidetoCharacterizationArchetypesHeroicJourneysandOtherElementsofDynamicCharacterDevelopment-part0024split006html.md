A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can show images that invoke peacefulness and meditation. Or you may display the opposite: chaotic messiness that does not offer a chance to relax—the chaos that needs to be ovecome. Perhaps there are no comfortable chairs to sit on, no place to read. Maybe televisions blare in every room and a host of distractions demand attention (a barking dog, a buzzing oven timer). In such a place, there is no opportunity to sit and be still.
You can create a color scheme, structure, and decor void of peace. The heroine can move from setting to setting, never finding an appropriate place to rest.
