A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY YOUR CHARACTER MIGHT RESIST THIS LESSON
Conflict occurs when the hero pushes away what little she possesses. It also occurs when she overlooks opportunities and forgoes chances that seem insignificant to her at that time.
It can also come from the heroine’s hopeless feelings. “Why should I even bother?” she thinks. She is looking at everything in her life in a cynical and pessimistic way. When she says “That’s just the way it is,” and accepts her horrible fate, she believes she is being realistic about life.
If she were to see the blessings around her, and recognize and respect all the things she should be grateful for, her identity as the cynical, pessimistic gal who thinks she is realistic would shatter. She doesn’t want to lose her identity, so she will fight to keep things the way they are. She may be somewhat happy to be known as the Cynic, thinking, “Well, I’m realistic and I can see that coming a mile away. Nobody is going to get anything on me.”
