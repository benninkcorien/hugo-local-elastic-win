A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
MENTAL VS. MENTAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, and so does the Father’s Daughter. She needs to get back to nature and to value herself as a woman, two things the Businessman cannot help her with.
They are very comfortable around each other. They work in the same type of environment, they take their work home with them, they work long hours, and both have a hard time socializing with those outside of their business circle.
They may see each other as ‘the perfect match,’ but things could get boring with all the similarities between them, especially if they work in the same office. She gets along with the men in the office so well, he may get jealous. Instead of talking to her about his insecurities he will get antagonistic and push her away, afraid of getting hurt.
She likes being the only female in the group. If they go out with a group of co-workers after work, she prefers (if only subconsciously) that the other females are Father’s Daughters too. Different archetypes can make her feel out of place. She doesn’t know how to flirt.
