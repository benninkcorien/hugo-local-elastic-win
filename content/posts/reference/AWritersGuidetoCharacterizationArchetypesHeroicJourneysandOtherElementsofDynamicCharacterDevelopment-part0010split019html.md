A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. She can help him relax and see the beauty in the world, but her naive nature will only bring out the Protector in him full force. She is his responsibility in his eyes, and he likes that.
She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times, and can share in his desire for travel and new experiences. He may not fly off the handle at all with her around because he feels she’s too easygoing and innocent for that. He protects her from his outbursts.
She must learn to stand on her own two feet. The Protector wants to take care of her and isn’t quick to teach her self-reliance. He is probably around much of the time so she doesn’t have to be alone to figure out what’s important to her.
The Protector may feel young again around her and enjoys showing off (especially his physical prowess) around her.
She looks up to him. He is the rock in her life and her personal defender. They clash if he lets his guard down and isn’t there for her when she needs him.
