A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE MAIDEN
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions; this is something the Maiden is great at. She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times, and knows how to draw him out of the office and into the world.
She needs to stand on her own two feet. While the Businessman may take care of her financially, he won’t necessarily be there for her emotionally or physically. He will be working and, therefore, away from her. This will force her to stand on her own two feet. She will be alone most of the time and will have to figure out who she is and what her interests are.
The Businessman can feel young around the Maiden, and he enjoys showing her off to his friends and co-workers. ‘See how much fun she is and how lively?’ She will express all the emotions he holds back. This may allow him to stay in his mind and figure things out. If they both get emotional, nothing will get done, he rationalizes. In this way he seems like a rock to her. She will choose him for a mate unless she meets a Protector first.
The Businessman doesn’t need or expect her to financially support him or their family, if they have one, so he’s fine with whatever she wants to do with her day—and that is exactly what she wants in a man.
They clash if he refuses to let his guard down in an effort to have fun with her or if she refuses to allow him to talk on an intellectual level. He may want her to read books so they can talk about his interests, but she may have a hard time with that depending on the subject.
