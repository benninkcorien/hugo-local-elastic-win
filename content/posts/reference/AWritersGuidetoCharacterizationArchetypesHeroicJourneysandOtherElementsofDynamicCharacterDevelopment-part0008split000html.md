A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 3MALE HEROES & VILLAINS
“Bond knew exactly where the switch was, and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-opened door of the bathroom and, after locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw on the settee beside the window. He then bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing desk.
Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper-ball cock.”—Casino Royale by Ian Fleming
While James Bond definitely has a bit of the Seducer in him, the Businessman archetype dominates. His identity as a spy is the most important thing in his life. He is a real workaholic and is very observant and analytical. The above passage illustrates this archetype by describing the way Bond approaches everything. He calmly checks all the traps he set for a potential intruder. He thought ahead and anticipated what the villain might do, drawing on his years of experience in the field. He sets several traps, not just one, and in different rooms. This is a man dedicated to his job. His deep inner world is that of a man who is suspicious yet professional.
This is an example of the kinds of traits that determine your character’s archetype. While a character may display characteristics of more than one archetype, usually one will dominate. Let’s examine the different archetypes for male characters.
