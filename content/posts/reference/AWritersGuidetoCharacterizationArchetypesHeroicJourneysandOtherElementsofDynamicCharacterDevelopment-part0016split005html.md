A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
A tragic resolution occurs when the heroine does not go far enough. She starts her pursuit, meets resistance, and stops cold. Or the heroine gets there and thinks that it’s just too much for her, she just can’t shake her negative thinking. Perhaps there is a bit of this at the end in Bridges of Madison County, when Francesca can’t open the car door and jump into the adventurous life she really wants with a new man. She feels the call of duty to stay with her family but perhaps she is afraid of taking a risk. Maybe everyday life would kill the romance they had, and she’s better off living with her memories.
