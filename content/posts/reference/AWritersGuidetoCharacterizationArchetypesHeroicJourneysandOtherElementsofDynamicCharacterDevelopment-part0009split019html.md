A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE WOMAN’S MAN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two men are very much alike. Both are somewhat childlike in their approach to life. They both love to play and party. The Fool is more youthful and innocent. He doesn’t have the experience the Woman’s Man has, and he doesn’t know how to treat or deal with women either.
The Fool can easily adapt. If he faces a hardship his eyes will open, and he will grow instead of becoming jaded like the Woman’s Man may. He may also fit into a traditional role if pushed toward it.
The Woman’s Man can see life for what it is; that is, minus an idealized fantasy. He can teach the Fool how to see reality and how to deal with it while remaining playful and true to oneself.
The Fool can teach the Woman’s Man to be more innocent and optimistic, and to simply get on with life when women leave him.
