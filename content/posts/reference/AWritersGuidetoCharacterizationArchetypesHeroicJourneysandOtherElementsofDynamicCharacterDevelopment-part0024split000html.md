A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 18THE HUMMINGBIRDFINDING INNER PEACE
“Hummingbird—the tiniest of all birds—brings special messages for us. It is the only creature that can stop dead while traveling at full speed. It can hover, or can go forward, backward, up or down. It lives on nectar and searches for the sweetness of life. Its long tongue lets it bypass the often tough and bitter outer layer to find the hidden treasures underneath.”—Crystallinks.org
The hummingbird symbolizes hope and joy, and seemingly has energy that comes out of nowhere. They never tire. Their wings move so fast that they are merely a blur. Many people can see the infinity sign when these birds flap their wings—that’s how fast those wings flap.
Hummingbirds are endowed with a playful quality. Years ago, I had a sun deck that they would visit with the intention of just sort of looking at me. When they came, I sensed their joy and playfulness. They zipped around, doing their thing and looking so calm and happy. That is what the hummingbird’s lesson is about: enjoying the moment to such an extent that you have utterly no concern for the past or future. People rush around a lot, not thinking, making mistakes, not being able to sit down and be quiet and find some peace.
The first time I saw a baby hummingbird I thought it was a large bee and I screamed. That was a lesson in perception and how one’s view of things can change her experience of them.
The hummingbird also teaches to live the following Zen saying: “Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.” Life itself does not change when we learn such lessons, but we live life in a more peaceful and whole way after they’ve been learned.
From life experience we know joy and sorrow are never far apart, so this is not to say that your character will experience total joy and sweetness through this whole lesson.
