SHALLOW: STUBBORN
SHALLOW: STUBBORN
Quote: “The “difficult” female character can—and will—do the shocking, the unexpected and, as a consequence, will give your story an immediate jolt of energy. She is the character who doesn’t fit the mold.” —bestselling author, Ruth Harris
With any type of characterization, I think it is better to “show” a character’s personality and flaws throughout the storyline rather than be told that a character is rude, or sad, or even stubborn.
For example, in a lot of popular romance novels, the alpha male character and their leading lady will display the stubborn trait. Sometimes stubbornness is just a resistance to change in his/her life, which can work as a great “fatal flaw” if your character has to overcome a significant growth ARC.
Most stubborn people have trouble admitting when they are wrong, which can add a lot of tension within your storyline between characters. These types of personalities would rather argue and fight than suffer a blow to their ego.
However, just stating a character trait like, “Tom was a stubborn person,” or whether the trait is a negative or positive one can cause narrative distance. And for me personally, I like getting to know the characters as the story progresses, and if it is directly stated, then it takes some of the enjoyment out of getting to know the characters.
Signs of stubbornness might be:
Thinned lips
A fixed stare
Clenched fists
Both arms crossed
Place hands on hips
Deep frowns
Refusing to listen or agree
Giving a sideways glance
A constant fear and sense of insecurity
Being afraid of change
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: He looked very angry and stubborn. “Damn it. There are no such things as ghosts!” he shouted loudly.
DEEP POV: He smacked his palm on the table with a force that rattled the dishes. When he spoke, Laura had to sit back, or she might’ve developed hearing loss. “Damn it. There are no such things as ghosts!”
SHALLOW: I was stalwart type of person and I did not like Demi bossing me around.
DEEP POV: I lifted my chin and looked her in the eye. “Stop bossing me around, Demi.”
SHALLOW: Scott was a very tenacious person.
DEEP POV: Scott stood rigid with his wide shoulders back. “End of discussion.”
SHALLOW: I refused to be bullied into going out tonight.
DEEP POV: I tossed hair over my shoulder. “Not gonna happen.”
SHALLOW: Carol stubbornly declined to help Daryl bury the zombies.
DEEP POV: With both arms crossed, Carol shook her head. “It’s your turn to bury the walkers, Daryl.”
SHALLOW: Julie didn’t understand why her sister was so obstinate.
DEEP POV: Julie stiffened at the challenge in her sister’s eyes.
SHALLOW: I saw Alyson shake her head persistently.
DEEP POV: Alyson shook her head and backed away.
SHALLOW: He was determined to win the argument.
DEEP POV: His arms overlapped, resting against his broad muscular chest.
Here is an excerpt taken from my novel, SMASH INTO YOU, where the main character is faced with a hard choice, yet stubbornly refuses to submit to cruel hazing tactics that are being forced upon her by the sorority that she’s trying to join.
Please carefully examine this scene…
DEEPER POV: 
“There’s no way I’m doing this,” I said, backing away. “If I get caught, I’ll get expelled.”
“You already have so many infractions that your legacy status is the only thing keeping us from dropping you like a bad habit,” Jade replied. “You’re still on probation.”
“You do realize what you’re giving up if you don’t do what we ask, right?” Brooklyn crossed her slim arms over her chest. “You’ll never be one of us.”
“You’ll be alone,” Claire said. “No sisters. No real social life. You might as well crawl back under the rock you clawed your way out of.”
I stared hard at glassy-eyed Claire. “Did you grow your hair out just to cover up the three sixes on your scalp?”
Claire glared at me, but did not respond.
I wanted to be a Zeta Beta sister. I wanted Paris. But a girl had to draw the line somewhere. And this was the place. I was sick of them screwing with me.
“I’m not going to get a man fired,” I said, finding the courage to look each one of them in the eye. “There are certain things I won’t do to join a sorority.”
“It’s your funeral,” Jade said. “We’re having a chapter meeting next week to discuss some issues that have recently transpired with two pledges, and I expect you to attend.”
Claire stepped forward. “And maybe you should consider de-pledging in front of the other girls that night. Everyone will want to know why we’re renouncing your bid.”
My legs quaked as I turned away from them. Turned away from the life I was so desperate to have. Turned my back on my Paris dreams. All because I stubbornly refused to participate in these humiliating traditions that the pledges were forced to do.
***
It is easy to “show” a stubborn character through their actions, reactions, and internal-monologue like shown in the excerpt above. Stubbornness is an interesting character flaw that can add a lot of tension to any storyline.
