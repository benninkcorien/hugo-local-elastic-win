A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE ARTIST
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two archetypes don’t see eye to eye at all. The Businessman will outwardly or subconsciously devalue the work the Artist does. He wants to make it in the logical world, and his creative/artistic side is the first thing he must suppress in order to achieve his goals. He can’t waste time dreaming.
On the other hand the Artist may see the Businessman as cold and devoid of passion. He can’t understand why he wants to go to the office every day. He enjoys creating and he may blame the Businessman for devising a society that devalues artistic accomplishments, thus keeping him from making a good living as an artist.
The Artist can teach the Businessman how to think ‘outside the box,’ to get creative with his solutions at work, and to value his passions if he can find them.
The Businessman can teach the Artist that logic, organization, and planning have valuable places in the world, for there would be chaos without them.
