Must-Know Knife Laws, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Must-Know Knife Laws
A Primer on How Knives Are Purchased
As with firearms, it’s important to understand a bit about the way knives are purchased and possessed in the United States. This may impact characters or the plot.
Knife laws can be a hodgepodge mess, sometimes varying widely at the state, county, and city levels. Possessing a certain knife can become a crime during a ten-minute drive down the street. Restrictions usually center on type (such as switchblades), blade length, and whether the knife can be opened with one hand (in the case of folding knives).
With no single set of regulations to follow, the responsibility to comply with knife laws falls mostly to the buyer. Take this notice on the Buck Knives website as an example:
Due to the complex and changing nature of knife laws, it is your responsibility, not Buck Knives’, to investigate and comply with international, federal, state, and local laws relating to the purchase, possession, use, transport, and resale of knives. Consult applicable laws if you are in doubt. By placing an order, you represent that the product(s) will be used in a lawful manner and you are of legal age. Absolutely no sales to minors. You agree to hold Buck Knives harmless from failure to comply with these terms and conditions of sale.
That’s the attitude most online knife sellers take. In-person sellers are a little more discerning, since the transaction takes place face-to-face.
These things actually matter quite a bit when writing fiction. For stories set after the advent of the Internet, consider it possible for characters to obtain just about any knife, whether its possession is legal or not. What the character does depends more on his moral compass than the laws.
If the setting is prior to the Internet, or the character can’t get online, research local laws to see what’s legal. Law-bending characters might still buy an illegal knife under the table.
Law enforcement and the military will always be exceptions. Consider those characters able to obtain any knife.
Switchblade Laws
Each state applies switchblade laws in a different way, but all use the federal 1958 Switchblade Act as a template. The Act can be read in its entirety at tinyurl.com/switchblade-law.
Two knife traits define a switchblade under the Act.
Inside the handle, the knife contains a concealed blade that is biased to open. That means it would exit the handle unless held in place by another mechanical element. The blade wants to open. That’s an important distinction that warrants further discussion.
The blade opens automatically when a button or switch on the handle of the knife is pressed. Blades that use gravity or inertia to open are also considered, but the button or switch on the handle is what matters most.
These knives cannot be traded through interstate commerce. Under Section 1242 of the Act, “whoever knowingly introduces, or manufactures for introduction, into interstate commerce, or transports or distributes in interstate commerce, any switchblade knife, shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”
Military and law enforcement organizations are exempt from these penalties. A person with one arm may also possess a switchblade under the Act, so long as the blade is less than 3 inches long. However, even beyond these exemptions, switchblades are not completely illegal in the United States. That’s because the Act regulates only interstate commerce. Each state is left to determine how to deal with switchblade commerce that exists within its borders.
Most state laws still prohibit switchblades through some variation of the Act. Others offer private ownership yet prohibit sales, while some have removed all restrictions. Laws are so nuanced from state to state that it is almost impossible to sum them up here. If the legality of a switchblade is important to a story, take the time to research specific state and local laws.
Of course, a character outside the law could get ahold of a switchblade no matter the location.
Switchblades Are So Twentieth Century: Meet the Assisted Opening Knife
Assisted opening knives, such as this Kershaw 1985ST RJI, look like regular folders. But inside is a mechanism that “assists” the blade once it’s halfway open. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Interstate commerce isn’t the area the Switchblade Act plays with the heaviest hand. That honor is reserved for the importation of knives. In 2009, an importation conflict led to the most significant change in knife laws (and stories featuring knives) in decades.
Most major U.S. knife companies outsource the manufacturing of their knives overseas. When ships with foreign-made knives hit U.S. ports, their cargo is regulated by federal law and enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The CBP doesn’t care what state laws say. As a federal agency, it’s there to enforce the 1958 Switchblade Act.
Things became messy when assisted opening knives hit the market in the mid-1990s and surged in popularity in the 2000s. Assisted openers, explained in detail in the Knives 101 section of this book, are almost identical to switchblades. However, their blades are biased to stay shut in the handle and they do not contain a switch or button on the handle that opens the knife. Those two key differences set them apart from switchblades, although to the eye they appear to function like switchblades.
Regardless, the CBP seized shipments of assisted openers at the U.S. border in the 2000s, citing the 1958 Switchblade Act. This created a huge amount of legal confusion. Assisted opening knives didn’t exist yet in 1958, when the Act was written; yet the CBP used it to confiscate imports. U.S. knife companies wound up paying hefty sums to retrieve their impounded knife shipments.
As a result, the knife industry, in conjunction with advocacy groups and enthusiasts, pressed Congress to exempt assisted openers from the 1958 Switchblade Act. Soon after one of the largest organized knife lobbying efforts in U.S. history, President Barack Obama signed an amendment to the Act in October 2009.
From that point on, assisted opening knives wouldn’t be considered illegal switchblades so long as:
the blade is biased to stay closed inside the handle.
the blade doesn’t open with a button or switch on the handle.
Just remember, a state or local law may view assisted openers differently (though most are tolerant of them). The exemption only applies to the federal Switchblade Act.
Writers Aren’t Lawyers, so Why Do These Knife Laws Matter?
This legal background actually impacts fiction writing in a number of ways.
Although they may look like switchblades when used, assisted opening knives are not switchblades. There is an important legal difference between the two, so you can’t call them switchblades in your writing.
Assisted opening knives have been available to characters across the country from the mid-1990s through today. It’s a better bet that a character would be using an assisted opener versus a switchblade.
Military and law enforcement characters are able to carry new switchblades, but they call them automatic knives when used in recent settings.
The switchblade market for civilians is limited. Most models are expensive custom jobs or antiques. Keep that in mind when assigning a character a switchblade instead of an assisted opener. Should the character be carrying an old switchblade? Does she have access to or an interest in newer, custom switchblades?
Actual switchblades are best for use in stories set prior to the mid-1990s.
If a character really needs a restricted switchblade, chances are good he would be able to obtain one from a dubious source.
Finally, my rule of thumb is to give characters living in the mid-1990s onward assisted opening knives instead of switchblades. If assisted opening knives is too clunky, go with assisted opener or just assisted after the first reference.
Other High-Regulation Knives
Switchblades aren’t the only knives with exceptional restrictions. Butterfly knives, knives disguised as mundane objects (canes, belts, etc.), concealed carry knives, dirks, daggers, knives with lengthy blades, and even folding knives may be subject to special attention from lawmakers.
These knives aren’t addressed at the federal level, though. They’re left to state and local jurisdictions. If a private investigator in your book needs to lawfully carry a concealed knife, for example, you should do a quick check of the city or state laws.
Pocket Clips
Starting in the 1980s, many knives were sold with pocket clips, which allowed users to hook them into a pocket for easier carrying, sort of like a pen.
But pocket clips can also tip off others that the character has a knife. When dealing with law enforcement, this may initiate something called a “Terry Stop.” That means a police officer conducts a limited search of a person’s clothing on the suspicion that he or she has a weapon. This is sometimes called a frisk.
For this reason, a character who’s experienced with knives might not use a pocket clip if stealth is a must. It’s just a matter of slipping the knife into the pocket instead of clipping it.
Is There a Perfectly Legal Carrying Knife?
When writing this guide, I made every attempt to identify a universally legal, go-to knife for characters to carry around in fiction, but to no avail. Outside of nail clippers and plastic picnic cutlery, no one in the knife industry will make the claim that a certain blade is legal absolutely everywhere in the United States.
That doesn’t mean there aren’t rules of thumb based in real-world experience. Mike Haskew came up with a couple of pointers in the Winter 2013 issue of Living Ready magazine. Knives that are generally legal in most locations should:
be a maximum blade length of 21⁄2 inches.
look like something Grandpa would’ve used.
These pointers are no guarantee, but a small, classic-looking pocketknife is the best bet for a universally legal carrying knife. If a story demands legality, go with that.
The Perfectly Acceptable Response
A solid set of rules exists for how characters should respond to law enforcement officers when knives are involved (if they want to stay out of trouble, that is). Haskew wrote his suggestions for real people who carry a knife and have a run-in with police.
When asked why the knife is being carried, the response is always, “Because it’s a tool.”
Never refer to the knife as a weapon.
Never say the knife is being carried for self-defense.
Never argue with officers about the knife.
Do not consent to a search without a warrant, but do not resist physically.
If arrested, say nothing other than to ask for an attorney.
Protagonists and antagonists in fiction will likely act in more dramatic ways, but at least you now have a good base from which to work.
Knives and Self-Defense
The law is not on the side of those who use knives violently, even for self-defense.
The most generous legal interpretation of self-defense in the entire United States permits violence only until the threat is stopped. One shot, one stab, one punch, one kick over that line, and it’s no longer considered self-defense.
With knives, the only self-defense application clearly within the bounds of law is to inflict an injury that allows a retreat that would not otherwise be possible. Even if you use a knife to prevent great bodily harm, things can get gray in a hurry.
That’s due to the nature of knife violence itself. The successful use of a knife (in a fighting situation) requires the person with the knife to hold a physical advantage over another. This leads to some murky legal territory, since self-defense laws are grounded in disparity of force (i.e., the one using the weapon is outmatched by a threat).
Stabbing someone to death for thirty seconds requires thirty seconds of holding a physical advantage over another. No disparity of force exists if the one with the knife can spend that time stabbing the other person to death—even if the one being stabbed was originally the “bad guy” in the situation. A jury might see such an incident as murder instead of self-defense.
Let’s drag Maynard’s sore bones out of his decrepit RV for an example.
Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective, is standing in line at a goat burger stand. Bill Robber, hungry from a recent jog evading his baby mamas, budges in front of Maynard.
The two get in an argument, and Bill pulls out a gun. Maynard, fearing for his life, takes out a knife and stabs Bill in the hand. Bill drops the gun. Maynard picks up the gun and continues to stab Bill in the hand and arm before both stagger away from the scene. Both Maynard and Bill survive.
Did Maynard break the law?
Depending on the setting, Maynard likely wound up on the wrong side of the law.
The threat to Maynard’s life was gone when he picked up Bill’s gun. He shouldn’t have stabbed Bill past that point, even if the budging bastard deserved it.
This is why the frenzied knife violence in thrillers and crime fiction doesn’t often reflect legal realities. Characters might think they’re acting in self-defense when they cut one hundred holes in the devil incarnate. But a prosecutor may not let that slide.
As suggested in the Must-Know Firearm Laws section, keep this nugget in mind: Stop the threat. That’s the point of self-defense.
A Brief Word About Concealed Carry of Knives
Just like firearms, knives are subject to concealed carry laws. These vary by state and local municipality. Research the laws of a particular setting to be certain. In general, states with relaxed firearms laws take the same attitude toward knives.
