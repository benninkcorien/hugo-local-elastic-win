A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE AMAZON
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn self-control and distance himself from explosive situations. The Amazon can help him with that if they are doing physical tasks. She’s also usually good at controlling her emotions.
She wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The Artist may value what she does—he often gets his artistic/creative energy burst after being exposed to the harshness of life, so he can value her causes.
He may not know how to act around the Amazon. She may be tougher than he is. This may make him feel like less of a man, thus he may be short with her and uncooperative. He already may have a hard time fitting in with other men because he’s so in touch with his emotions, and he doesn’t want women to make him feel uncomfortable too.
She has a hard time understanding all the creative jargon he uses and wonders if he is trying to impress her or make her feel stupid. He can be a good balance for her, but they will have a tough time making things work if he’s not assertive.
