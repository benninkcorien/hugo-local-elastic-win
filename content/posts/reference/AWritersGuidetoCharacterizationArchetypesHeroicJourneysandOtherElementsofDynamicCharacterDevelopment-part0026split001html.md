A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE SNAKE’S CHARACTER ARC
This lesson is about letting go of your ‘self’—of your identity as you know it. Just as the snake sheds its skin, the hero will go through a rebirth and transformation. The lesson includes an element of letting go and allowing something greater than yourself to pull you along. There is no stopping this type of transformation once it has begun.
During the course of this arc, a major change in conditions occurs or a creative awakening happens. Some see the snake as a devil and some see it as a transformer or a healer. If you fight the snake’s efforts, it can feel like a devilish force has come into your life and disrupted everything. It is better to accept it as more of a process of healing or a positive opportunity. The character arc produces a sense of complete, almost traumatic, transformation.
The hero really doesn’t have much of a choice in the situation. Something comes into the hero’s life and demands the hero let go of everything and become completely reborn. As part of the transformation, the character may go away and hibernate the same way snakes disappear in colder months. So, not only do snakes shed their skin and go through a renewal process, they also disappear for a while to help foster this transformation.
Unusual elements may play a part as well. Just as snakes are known for smelling with their flickering tongues, the hero may have a special skill or talent that helps with his transformation.
