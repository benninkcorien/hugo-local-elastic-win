A Writer’s Guide to Characterization

   •  Questions authority, is disciplined, has inner strength, will sacrifice himself for the good of all, strong beliefs. A good example is Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Messiah characters can embody other archetypes.
   •  As a villain, the Male Messiah becomes the Punisher who kills a man’s spirit in order to transform that man.
