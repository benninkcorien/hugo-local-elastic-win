A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. These are the Seductive Muse’s specialties. She can teach him how to be more extroverted and how to enjoy the sensual side of life. She will enjoy teasing him.
She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks. The Recluse is able to see a woman for her inner beauty instead of just her outer beauty. He will recognize her brains and her spirit within.
The Seductive Muse loves to be around people who are in touch with their body and their creative side. She loves to play and explore, and anything kinesthetic.
He may see her as a wonderful confidant. His whole world seems to open up when she is around. He never knew the physical world could hold so much beauty and wonder. He also likes her creative side because it comes from deep within, a place he’s very familiar with. He will encourage the creative side within her.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver.
The Recluse sees the Seductive Muse as fun and adventurous, but a little too intense for his taste at times. He knows she is not one to commit to, but he will enjoy her company all the same. The Seductive Muse loves a take-charge kind of guy, but the Recluse is not one to take charge. He will let her leave when she wants to. He may not know how to ask her to stay.
