A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER AND THE MYSTIC
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Father’s Daughter and the Mystic have one thing in common: They are both able to sit alone for hours. The difference is that the Mystic is usually enjoying herself while the Father’s Daughter is looking for things to occupy her mind so she can get through the boredom.
Very often the Father’s Daughter works so hard she doesn’t know what to do when she has a day off. The Mystic can teach her to look inside herself to discover her true passion.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Mystic to come out of her shell. She can role model the joy of learning and reading about new things, and perhaps inspire the Mystic to go back to school.
