A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
Bilbo confronts spiders, trolls, and the great dragon Smaug, all of which give him an opportunity to test his resourcefulness.
Apollo 13
Two days after launch, an oxygen tank explodes in a spaceship. The crew members must use their resourcefulness and quick thinking to make it back home alive using hoses, cardboard, plastic bags, and canisters
The Odyssey by Homer
In this epic poem, Odysseus’s most distinguishing traits are his intellect and quick wit. When he struggles with the Cyclops, he devises a plan to use the Cyclops’ strength to his advantage. He defeats the Cyclops and a boulder is removed from an entrance he needs to pass through.
Misery by Stephen King
A former nurse with an obsession kidnaps and tends to her favorite author after he survives a car accident. The author character tricks the nurse by asking her for a cigarette and match, lighting his new manuscript on fire, and then attacking her when she is distracted.
