A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE RECLUSE
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Businessman and the Recluse are very different, but they have one thing in common: They are both able to sit alone for hours. The difference is the Recluse is usually enjoying himself while the Businessman is looking for things to occupy his mind so he can get through the boredom. He doesn’t have many friends outside of work.
Very often the Businessman works so hard he doesn’t know what to do with himself when he has a day off. The Recluse can, reluctantly, teach him to look inside himself to find his true passion.
The Businessman can teach the Recluse to come out of his shell and teach him about the joy of learning and reading about new things.
