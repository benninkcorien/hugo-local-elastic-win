A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
This is a scary lesson to learn. Those who have a goal often have a vision of how they think that goal should proceed. We hold tightly to this vision, and sometimes we try to force things to happen. We dominate the vision until it materializes.
Obtaining something as planned gives us a sense of accomplishment and control over our lives. But often it doesn’t work this way, and many of us don’t achieve our bigger goals in life. What we need to do is let go and allow events to happen. When we let go, we create space for ideas and people to come in, and we allow our goals to come to fruition in their own time and space.
