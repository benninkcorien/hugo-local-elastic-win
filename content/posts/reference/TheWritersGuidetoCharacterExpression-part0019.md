SHALLOW: ANTAGONISM
SHALLOW: ANTAGONISM
Quote:  “Instead of stating a situation flat out, you want to let the reader discover what you’re trying to say by watching a character in action and by listening to his/her dialogue.  Showing brings your characters to life.” —bestselling author, Janet Evanovich
This chapter will demonstrate how writers can show opposition or hostility toward another character through the expressions and body language of a villain or another opposing character. It is also a great way to reveal insight into your antagonist or even the mighty hero. These tips and tools should also help you revise any fight scenes. The examples will “show” how to convey the aggression through the Deep POV method to strengthen your writing.
Let’s start with expressive body movements and animated gestures that are commonly used to signal aggression toward another character. Outward aggression can be shown in the facial expression, from judgmental frowns and puckered lips to snickers and full-on growls. The character’s eyes can be used to convey a threat through a bold stare, and body temperature can increase as well to show heated cheeks and a sweaty brow.
When someone is about to attack another character, they usually give a visible signal such as clenching their fists, or spreading their feet apart for stability, or they might get red in the face. A character might pace with restlessness, or invade the personal space of the hero in a display of aggression by the villain.
Some physical signs of aggression might be:
Clenched teeth and jaws
Pointing or jabbing with a finger
Shaking body
Clenched fists
Rapid breathing/sharp drawing in  breath
Rigid posture
Restlessness, fidgeting
Flushed face or extreme paleness of face
Verbal threats
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I was so angry at Leo that I wanted to punch him.
DEEP POV: My body shook and my fingers curled into tight fists.
SHALLOW: Major looked furious and he lifted his chin in angry defiance. (cliché)
DEEP POV: The tip of Major’s ears reddened, and he lifted his chin a notch to stare down at me like a bug he wanted to smash under the heel of his sneaker.
SHALLOW: I was very angry and I wanted to kick Charles in the face.
DEEP POV: I raised both hands, my fists clenched as if ready to strike, and took a boxer’s stance.
SHALLOW: Carl looked extremely aggressive and moved his arms in an angry way.
DEEP POV: Carl’s chest puffed out and he wildly waved his hands around as he spoke.
Please study and compare these longer examples…
SHALLOW: Miguel marched in outraged strides in front of me and then he moved closer to me.
DEEP POV: Miguel stomped back and forth like a jumpy tiger, until he unexpectedly spun on his booted heel and stepped right up to me.
Please study this longer example of aggression…
SHALLOW: I angrily went into the building, and flung open the door. Then I heatedly marched to his desk and used my arm to slide everything off the desk.
DEEP POV: I burst into the building, the door swinging open and banging into the wall. Huffing, I stomped over to my boss’s desk and with one brutal sweep of my arm, slid everything off the surface and onto the floor.
***
Try not to clutter your prose with too many filter words that will convey obvious information like aggression. The fact that the character or villain was antagonistic should be understood by the reader without being bluntly told. Use all of these illustrations to spark your own creative muse!
