A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
Tasting:
   •  Are they eating together? Does he feed her from his own plate?
   •  How do his kisses taste to the heroine?
   •  Does she ‘sour’ as he walks away? Or ‘sweeten’ as he comes near?
   •  Does everything taste better when she is around?
Describe love as if it were a taste. “Her lips tasted of honey and wine.”
