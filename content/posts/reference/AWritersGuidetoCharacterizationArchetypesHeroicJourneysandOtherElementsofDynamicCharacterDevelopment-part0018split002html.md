A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin
A woman learns of her husband’s death and is at first upset. Then she feels unimaginable joy as she realizes she is free to pursue her interests. But the joy is short-lived (society will not stand for it as this story takes place a long time ago, when women were considered possessions) with a surprise ending. “Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband’s death.”
Walden by Henry David Thoreau
Thoreau calls us to lead simpler lives balancing solitude and growth, and shows us that nature can support us in this quest.
2001: A Space Odyssey
An exploration of what it means to be human, and to discover how we came to be and whether we can transcend or not.
Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse
Addresses the spiritual journey of man and the goal of transcendence as Siddhartha embarks on a journey of his own making to find enlightenment.
Cool Runnings
A group of athletes from Jamaica try to race bobsleds in the Olympics. It is their calling and they go through many trials to try and fulfill it. After all, there is no snow in Jamaica and the odds are against them. They try to be like everyone else, but they are not successful until they do things their own way and honor their gifts.
