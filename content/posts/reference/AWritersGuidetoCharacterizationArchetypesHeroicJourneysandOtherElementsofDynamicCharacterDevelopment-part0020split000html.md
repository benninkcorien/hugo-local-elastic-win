A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 14THE HORSEFREEDOM & VICTORY
“No single animal has contributed more to the spread of civilization than the horse. Horse brings with it new journeys. It will teach you to ride into new directions to awaken and discover your own freedom and power.” —Ted Andrews
This lesson deals with freedom, movement, travel, speed, and victory. Horses, despite their large size are prey animals, not predators. In my personal work with horses (horse whispering), I found that if I had a negative thought or really bad feeling, the horse would walk away from me. They are very sensitive to energy and intention, and they won’t voluntarily be with you and follow you unless you are in a grounded, truthful state.
The horse could literally sense disharmony between my movements and emotional energy. (I’m sure you’ve been around someone who feels angry but says, “I’m fine,” and fakes a smile.) Therapists use horses in therapy to help clients see when they are not facing a feeling head-on.
The horse also needs to feel free to make his own decisions about where to go and what to do. This gives him a sense of safety and comfort.
The lesson here is intricate. It teaches the heroine how to be free and to allow others to be free. It’s about moving forward toward the goal, having access to speed and travel, and discovering the truthfulness that will lead to victory. The heroine must have a free spirit and she must intend to do good regardless of her goal. However, the horse is also about victory because those in history who rode horses succeeded in battle. But, as in The Shawshank Redemption, victory and freedom can be an inner experience.
