A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
You can use gender as a way to give this lesson a twist because it is “not as acceptable” for women to be assertive as it is for men. Women may have to give up certain areas of their lives because it’s hard to be assertive all day in the workplace and to revert to feminine energy for relationships. A lot of professionals find they have to learn how to switch gears.
Play around with this gender and have a male character that must learn to be assertive. That could make him feel better in his masculinity since he is not that way now. Another man could be making fun of him. You could also use a cultural twist. Many cultures portray men as more assertive than women. You could definitely play with that stereotype by making the man in the story less assertive and the woman more assertive. He constantly needs a secretary to step up and take care of business.
Observe people in their daily lives. You will see that often people who aren’t assertive at all will become very assertive when a situation involves standing up for their kids or their pets. They are more willing to become assertive for loved ones than for themselves.
Some people mistake anger for assertiveness. Anger is not the same thing as assertiveness and many people need to learn this lesson. Yelling and being mean, hurtful, and angry is not assertive behavior. That’s another twist you might want to use. Perhaps some character thinks he’s being assertive, but he’s not.
It’s an interesting lesson to play with, one that offers the opportunity to experiment with different character dynamics and varying positions and levels of power, especially within companies. Other areas of life can throw a wrench in the works while your hero waits for his opportunity and prepares for his moment to pounce.
