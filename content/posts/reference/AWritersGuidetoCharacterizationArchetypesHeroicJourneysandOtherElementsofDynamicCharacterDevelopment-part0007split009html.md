A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE NURTURER
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Amazon understands how to nurture and care for others, but she doesn’t understand why the Nurturer may lose her identity in the process. When she’s around the Nurturer, she wants to protect her from those who would take advantage of her good nature.
The Nurturer knows she’s not strong like the Amazon but she doesn’t see the need to be. Her importance in the lives of all the people who need her help so desperately makes her strong. She contributes something and helps others just as the Amazon may contribute by saving the earth and calling others to stand up for their rights.
The Nurturer can teach the Amazon to stay focused and in one place long enough to do the right thing. The Nurturer won’t give up on anyone, even if that person begs her to leave him alone.
The Amazon, on the other hand, will honor such a request and leave. Still, she recognizes that the Nurturer sticks with the problem and winds up helping the person.
