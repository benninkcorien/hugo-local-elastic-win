A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
The twist on this could be about getting into a group and learning how to communicate, and then butting up against another group. How does the hero manage that kind of dynamic? Does his group work with another group well? How do the two groups communicate? You can explore different types of groups and organizations based on different criteria, such as beliefs or religion, or whether they are charities, companies, or corporations. How do the groups interact, and how do the individuals from each group interact?
Or you could portray a group that does not communicate well but somehow fumbles through based on individual strengths. Somehow it still works.
A lot of stories address the issue of families and the individual who tries to leave the family. Perhaps the hero, having gone home for the holidays, finds himself back in the family setting again and the story is about how the hero fits back in—or doesn’t. Very often it becomes about that person maintaining his individuality and not quite being a part of the family anymore.
