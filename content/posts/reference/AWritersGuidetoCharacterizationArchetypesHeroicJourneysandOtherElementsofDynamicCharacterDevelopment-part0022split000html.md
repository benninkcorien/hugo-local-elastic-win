A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 16THE WOLFINDIVIDUALITY & THE GROUP DYNAMIC
“Even though living in close knit packs provide wolves with a strong sense of family, they are still able to maintain their individuality. Wolves represent the spirit of freedom, but they realize that having individual freedom requires having responsibilities.”—Animaltotem.com
Wolves are very direct. What they say (grunts and growls) is congruent with their body language. They bump into each other, and they say what they mean. There is no way to misunderstand what a wolf is communicating. The group as a whole picks up on each individual’s communication—no interpretation needed.
This is one of the best ways to work in a group. Learning how to communicate effectively is key to this lesson, and so the character arc teaches the value of being in a group and how to communicate to get things done when working with others.
