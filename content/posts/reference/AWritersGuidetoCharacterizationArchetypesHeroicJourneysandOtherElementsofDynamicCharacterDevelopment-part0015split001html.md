A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE COUGAR’S CHARACTER ARC
The entire story can be about the hero getting ready for the SOMETHING moment. Viewers watch him becoming assertive; stepping into his power and space, becoming knowledgeable. He is figuring out who he is and what his skills are, and really getting to know himself and what he offers.
Or it can be about a character who already knows himself and is already prepared, but for one reason or another is allowing another character (or an area of his life) to wreck his plan. He has to deal with those issues before he can step up.
He is ready to pounce, but something happens to stop him. For example, a business merger is his top priority but then his mother or spouse gets sick or has a crisis situation and needs his attention. The story becomes a question of priorities and about learning a life lesson. It’s about the hero knowing who he is and where he should focus his assertiveness. An assertive character would likely go to the hospital and really get on top of his spouse’s medical treatment and make sure everything is running smoothly.
You could also apply the hero’s assertive behavior in places where it’s not going to do much good. The hero needs to learn that sometimes he needs to step back and assert his power in more subtle ways. More often than not, a conflict arises when the hero abuses his power or gets his priorities mixed up. This is a second kind of hero that really is not assertive and desperately needs to learn to be in order to reach his goal.
