A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE NURTURER
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. Being the Caretaker that she is, the Nurturer won’t create explosive situations, and she can help him deal with life and his emotions.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and find her own identity. The Artist may need a lot of attention so she will probably be attached to him. If he works from home, they may be together a lot and she will have to deal with his emotional ups and downs.
She understands his creative side and will give him the space he needs when pursuing his interests. He will understand her need to help others and will support her, unless the need takes over her life. He may get jealous of the people she cares for.
He can be very intense and passionate and can teach her about caring deeply for another in a romantic way.
