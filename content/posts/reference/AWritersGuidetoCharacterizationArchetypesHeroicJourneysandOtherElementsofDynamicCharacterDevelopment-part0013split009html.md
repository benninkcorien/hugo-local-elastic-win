A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
Hibernation is universal and therefore a lot of people can relate to it. Readers will enjoy watching how your heroine grapples with her problems and hopefully comes out ahead.

In other words, to stop them from jumping to conclusions and offer an alternative to staying constantly busy. Most people can relate to how hard it is to sit in silence and deal with the many thoughts that come bubbling up as you relax and get more grounded. That’s why this is a lesson that a lot of readers will relate to—and that’s good because you want to use lessons in your story that people can identify with.
