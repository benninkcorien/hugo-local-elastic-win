A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE WHALE’S CHARACTER ARC
The character arc is a journey of radical self-acceptance. The heroine must do something outwardly that shows and supports who she is becoming inwardly.
You might have a person who, after much drama, accepts what is going on in her life and finally seeks help. Maybe she moves into a group home to learn how to manage life in general. Later the heroine can prove that she has changed by going out into the world, doing regular things, and acting in self-reliant ways. This only happens if she accepts herself. In order for her to do so, she must seek the training and the environment that will help her deal. From there, she can move forward in her life.
The heroine could wind up languishing in a small town where the natives are unfamiliar with what she is going through. Perhaps she ends up drinking or getting into destructive behaviors in order to suppress her true nature. For instance, maybe she is psychic and surrounded by people who think such things are ‘of the devil.’
