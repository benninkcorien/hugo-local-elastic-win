Knives 101, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Knives 101
Unlike firearms, it’s easier to get away with writing knives generically. Just writing “knife” and describing its function can be enough in thrillers and crime fiction. However, in reality knives can be just as nuanced as guns. There’s a reason so many kinds of knives exist. Different designs perform better for certain tasks. A firm understanding of these differences will add a stroke of realism to your stories.
And don’t forget about striking characters with specialized knobs or studs on the pommel (the bottom of the knife’s handle). These studs are sometimes called “skull crushers” for a good reason.
Switchblades
Note: Be sure to read about assisted opening knives later in this section before writing a switchblade into a story.
When most people think of a switchblade, they imagine the long, thin profile of an Italian stiletto. That doesn’t necessarily mean the knife comes from Italy. It’s just the name of a style of switchblade, made by various manufacturers since the early 1900s. The Italian stiletto is the knife depicted most often in thrillers and crime fiction.
For the purposes of this guide, assume all switchblades refer to Italian stilettos. There are, however, many styles of switchblades in the real world.
Switchblades are the “assault weapons” of the blade world. Because switchblade is used to both label a large category of restricted knives and to describe a particular mechanical design, it can lead to some confusion about what a switchblade actually is. Here’s the federal definition:
A switchblade opens a blade concealed inside the handle of the knife.
The concealed blade is biased to come out of the handle (that’s an important distinction). In other words, the blade wants to come out of the handle. Springs are usually used to create the force for this bias.
A button or switch on the handle of the knife is pressed to make the blade come out of the handle. The blade can come out the front or side of the handle. Moving the blade back inside the handle recharges the force in the springs.
If a knife doesn’t meet those criteria, it’s not a switchblade, regardless of how it’s labeled. Read more in the section on knife laws.
Fiction’s love affair with switchblades is left over from a cultural paranoia of the mid-twentieth century that permeated fiction and film. To understand why, rewind to the 1950s. Movies like Rebel Without a Cause and The Wild One highlighted the use of switchblades by “problem youth” and biker gangs.
Whether there actually was a problem with these groups wielding knives is up for debate. As BLADE magazine editor Steve Shackleford told me in an interview, movies sensationalized the use of switchblades by gangs, and then moral-crusading politicians looking to make a name for themselves latched onto these movies. They identified switchblade restrictions as a way to crack down on gangs. A movie-watching public responded enthusiastically.
Joe Kertzman, BLADE magazine managing editor, said that larger social issues were also at play. “Politicians capitalized on the fears of white suburbanites about violent inner-city gangs. Because of joblessness and poverty in the inner city at the time, most of these gangs consisted of minority groups.”
Popular culture reinforced these fears with its depiction of gangs using switchblades, a notable theme and major plot point in the Reginald Rose jury room drama Twelve Angry Men, later remade into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1957.
Kertzman stressed that growing urban poverty, not switchblades, fueled the violence committed by these gangs. Still, switchblade restrictions were seen as a way to calm fears in the white electorate.
These factors led to the passage of the 1958 Federal Switchblade Act. Combined with similar state laws that followed, the Act limited the switchblade industry to a handful of states and municipalities that permit the knives. You can find more information on the subject in the section on knife laws.
None of this means writers can’t play up switchblades in their stories. However, there’s nothing exceptionally deadly about them compared to other knife types. Fixed blade knives will always open faster than switchblades because they’re never closed. Folding knives are just as concealable. Assisted opening knives offer identical one-handed use.
It’s important to note that most switchblades still in circulation are antiques. If a present-day character buys a switchblade, it’s probably as old or older than he or she is. The new switchblades are custom jobs manufactured in the states that allow them. A character with dubious intentions could probably obtain one no matter the setting.
New, high-quality switchblades are still manufactured for law enforcement and military (and available to civilians in switchblade-friendly states). When writing in these modern switchblades, call them automatic knives. Write them as such to stand out from the herd, although switchblade is still appropriate.
Automatic knives are the modern equivalent of switchblades. They’re designed for heavy-duty purposes and are therefore not Italian stilettos. They stab, cut, and slice using the latest materials and technology. Automatics are ideal fighting knives for thrillers and crime fiction and share many of the characteristics outlined in the section on assisted openers. Automatic knives can open from the side, like the traditional switchblade, or from the front. When they open and close from the front, they are called “out the front” (OTF) knives.
Advantages
The stigma of crime surrounding switchblades makes their mere presence intimidating. In fiction, a well-timed pop-click sound from a switchblade opening means it’s time to get down to business.
They’re easy to conceal and transport.
A switchblade can be opened and operated with only one hand. It may require two hands to close it, though.
A switchblade’s design makes it ideal for stabbing, when the force is concentrated on the tip of the blade.
Disadvantages
Switchblades are red flags for criminal activity. Characters who don’t want to stand out probably wouldn’t carry one.
Switchblades are not as tough as they look. They lack a long tang, which is an extension of the blade that runs inside the handle to offset pressure during use. Thus, they can’t handle as much pressure as other knives. Think of switchblades like drill bits. If a lot of force is concentrated anywhere but the tip, there’s a chance the blade could snap off of the knife.
Like most folding knives, switchblades use a lock, which is a mechanism that holds the blade open. It’s located at the joint of the blade and handle. The older a lock is, the more likely it will unintentionally release the blade. This is especially true if pressure is put on the blade anywhere but at the tip. A failing lock could close the blade back onto the hand of the person using it. Because a lot of antique switchblades are in circulation, a character might consider this when heading to a fight.
Switchblades are not the most reliable. Springs wear out and can be difficult to replace. Old switchblades have old springs, and their blades don’t always open completely. The character using it would have to manually open the blade the rest of the way. That’s precious time wasted during a fight.
Because of their age, those ubiquitous antique switchblades don’t usually come with pocket clips. A pocket clip is a metal clamp on the handle of the knife. It hooks onto the top of a pocket. This makes the knife easier to carry and to draw from the pocket. Since they lack pocket clips, switchblades spend a lot of time at the bottom of pockets. That means lint, dirt, and other grime can gum things up and affect how fast the blade opens. It also means a character would have to dig around in her pocket to access the knife—not ideal if she’s about to enter a fight.
Italian stilettos are not exactly ergonomic. No matter the character, it’s unlikely he will have a rock-solid grip on one. That’s not good if the character is in a fight.
Switchblades and their parts are harder to obtain than other knives. This has to do with their legal restrictions.
For scenarios involving stealth, the pop-click of a switchblade opening could give away a character’s position.
Compared to other knife types, switchblades have a steeper learning curve. They’re better for characters who have experience with knives.
Even the fastest switchblade cannot be ready for a fight as fast as a fixed blade knife can. Fixed blade knives, covered in another section, don’t contain moving parts.
The market for switchblades is ripe for scams. This is another hurdle a character seeking a switchblade must overcome. Sellers may charge a buyer a premium for a switchblade when what they’re actually selling is a perfectly legal assisted opening knife. Those are covered in the next section.
Inaccurate Example
“Is it my imagination, or is someone hiding behind that trash can?” Maynard Soloman said to himself. He stared at the can a few feet away and listened.
Crouched behind the large receptacle, Bill Robber popped open his switchblade and waited for Maynard to continue walking.
“I must be hearing things again,” Maynard said and turned away. “Either that or I’m talking out loud instead of thinking in my head. Gotta stop doing that.”
Bill sprang into action as soon as Maynard started walking. He slit the detective’s throat from behind and watched him die on the sidewalk. To cover his tracks, Bill cut up Maynard’s body and dumped the pieces into the trash can.
“Colonel Sanders himself couldn’t put a better bucket of meat together,” Bill said as he slipped away.
Accurate Example
“Is it my imagination, or is someone hiding behind that trash can?” Maynard Soloman said to himself. He stared at the can a few feet away and listened.
Crouched behind the large receptacle, Bill Robber gripped his fixed blade hunting knife and waited for Maynard to continue walking.
“I must be hearing things again,” Maynard said and turned away. “Either that or I’m talking out loud instead of thinking in my head. Gotta stop doing that.”
Bill sprang into action as soon as Maynard started walking. He slit the detective’s throat from behind and watched him die on the sidewalk. To add insult to injury, Bill cut up Maynard’s body and dumped the pieces into the trash can.
“Colonel Sanders himself couldn’t put a better bucket of meat together,” Bill said as he slipped away.
What Went Wrong?
Switchblades are deceiving when it comes to stealth. On the one hand, they can easily slip into a pocket. On the other, they make a distinctive noise when opened. Bill must’ve forgotten that in the inaccurate example. He opened the switchblade while Maynard was staring at the trash can. The sound should’ve given him away.
After he killed Maynard, Bill needed more than a switchblade to dismember Maynard’s body. Switchblades aren’t cut out for hard use. They’re better for stabbing or light slicing (slitting Maynard’s throat was an ideal application, by the way, that was on target in the inaccurate version). The ruggedness of a fixed blade knife is the better call. Switching to that type of knife also kept Bill quieter behind the trash can. No moving parts means no noise.
Remember to keep track of blood loss and to consider how it plays into the story. Maynard’s injured throat would’ve spilled a ton of blood onto the sidewalk. Why would Bill bother hiding the body in the trash can at that point? This is remedied in the accurate version as a way to further insult Maynard’s demise.
Left uncorrected, though, is how messy Bill must be after exiting the scene. He’s going to be bloody, both from slitting Maynard’s throat and working with the detective’s body. This is a blind spot in many stories featuring knife violence. Does a bloody Bill impact the plot later? Would his condition raise suspicions with other characters?
One final note: This scene could’ve worked with the switchblade. Bill could’ve had the switchblade open in the first place, slit Maynard’s throat, and ran away. Either way, keep the action consistent with the knife type.
Assisted Opening Knives
The Kershaw Leek is one of my favorite assisted opening knives. Instead of a switchblade, write an assisted opener instead. As this image shows, the blade doesn’t open automatically. It must be swung open manually more than halfway before an assisting mechanism takes over. That all happens very fast. For practical writing purposes, it functions like a switchblade, but the writer looks more knowledgeable. (Author's photo.)
Popular assisted opening knives: Benchmade Barrage, Columbia River Knife & Tool M4, Gerber F.A.S.T., Kershaw Leek, SOG Aegis
Not familiar with assisted opening knives? Here’s a tip. Replace the word switchblade with assisted opening knife or assisted opener in a story. The two types function so similarly that they’re identical for the practical purposes of writing. The difference is assisted openers are popular and switchblades are not (due to legal restrictions), although that’s not obvious to someone outside knife enthusiasm.
An assisted opening knife functions almost exactly like a switchblade. To the eye, it might appear they’re identical, since each opens with that classic pop-click. However, there are two important differences.
First, when the blade is inside the handle of an assisted opener, it’s biased to stay inside the handle. Only after opening the blade manually about halfway does a mechanism “assist” it the rest of the way.
Second, there is no button or switch on the handle that is pressed to open the knife. Instead the operator moves a piece of a blade itself, usually a stud, disc, hole, or notch. This swings the blade out from the handle until it becomes biased to open. At that point, springs or torsion bars “assist” the opening of the blade. Most assisted openers open from the side of the handle, not the front.
That’s different from the federal definition of a switchblade. Those knives use blades always biased to open, and they feature a release button or switch on the handle. Because of these two key differences, assisted opening knives are legal in most of the United States. That’s made this type of knife incredibly popular since it was introduced in the mid-1990s. Characters in settings prior to 1996 would not have encountered an assisted opening knife. As a matter of fact, the best, earliest year to assign a character an assisted opener is 1998.
Because of their one-handed operation and legal status, assisted opening knives are popular with consumers. A person is much more likely to possess an assisted opening knife than a switchblade or automatic knife.
Advantages
Assisted openers offer all the advantages of a switchblade, plus some big leaps forward in technology, with none of the legal drawbacks.
They’re easy to conceal and transport.
Because of their legality, assisted openers are easier to purchase and more ubiquitous than switchblades.
One-handed operation makes assisted openers easy and quick to use. Blades open as fast or faster than switchblades. Advances in design and technology make closing the blade with one hand possible.
For characters looking to intimidate, assisted opening knives benefit from the stigma of switchblades. The pop-click of an assisted opener sounds and looks just like a switchblade.
The mechanism that holds the assisted opener’s blade open, called a lock, is more reliable than the locks on switchblades. Some even become more secure as they age. Since they’re legal, manufacturers can pursue better lock design and technology. This means the blade isn’t as likely to close unintentionally onto the character’s hand. It can still happen, though.
Unlike switchblades, most assisted openers come with a pocket clip. This makes them easier to pull from a pocket than switchblades, which don’t usually have clips. Clips also cut down on lint and grime from the pocket gumming things up, making assisted openers even more reliable.
Most assisted opening blades are designed to take pressure on the tip as well as along the edge. They’re suitable for stabbing, cutting, and slicing. These capabilities put them a step ahead of the classic Italian stiletto, which is better suited to stabbing and light slicing propositions.
Disadvantages
Like switchblades, assisted opening knives lack a long tang. which means the blades are susceptible to snapping off. However, the better locks and better overall design of assisted openers make this less likely to happen.
The locks sometimes fail (allowing the blade to close on the hand of the operator), so characters who need to perform intense cutting tasks would be better off using a fixed blade knife.
The fastest assisted opening knife will never be faster than a fixed blade knife. A fixed blade knife doesn’t need to unfold.
Springs and torsion bars wear out over time, weakening the “assisted” component of these knives. Unlike switchblades, though, manufacturers have made it easier to access and replace these parts.
For scenarios involving stealth, the pop-click that an assisted knife makes when opening could give the character away.
Inaccurate Example
“You musta got that nice tan when you went to the Cayman Islands to make that special bank deposit,” said Maynard Soloman to Bill Robber. The tanned Bill sat tied to a chair in the detective’s RV. “Or is that just the bullshit leaking through your skin?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I never went to the Caymans, and I’m not full of BS,” Bill said as he struggled against the restraints. “I’ve been here in New York City the entire time.”
“Fine, let’s talk about a different trip then,” Maynard said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an Italian stiletto. “Ever been to Italy? I just bought this brand-new switchblade from the shop down the street. I could bring Italy to you. Into you.”
“Okay, I admit it. I went to the Caymans,” Bill said. “I’ll give you all the account numbers you need.”

“Fine, let’s talk about a different trip then,” Maynard said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an Italian stiletto. “Ever been to Italy? I just bought this brand-new switchblade from the shop down the street. I could bring Italy to you. Into you.”
Bill blinked twice at the tip of the Italian stiletto, then once more for good measure.
“Uh, Maynard, normally when people threaten me, they do it with a knife,” Bill said. “That’s a woman’s high-heeled shoe.”
Maynard raised an unruly eyebrow and checked the stiletto in his hand. He rearranged the bags around his eyes and looked again.
“Those gal-damn punks pulled a fast one on me again,” Maynard said and pitched the shoe at the wall. “This is the last time I try to buy a knife off the street at midnight. These eyes just aren’t what they used to be.”
Bill leaned his head back and laughed, popping the veins in his neck.
“Funny joke, isn’t it, Bill? Laugh away, chuckle-face,” Maynard said. He produced the new assisted opening knife he’d actually bought at the shop and opened it with a pop-click. “It’ll make it easier to slit your throat.”
“Okay, I admit it. I went to the Caymans,” Bill said. “I’ll give you all the account numbers you need.”
What Went Wrong?
Here’s a tip about big cities: They have the strictest knife restrictions. That can mean more legwork for writers setting a knife scene in a metropolis.
The Big Apple is exceptional in many ways, especially when it comes to knife laws. A little research reveals that New York City doesn’t allow sale or possession of Italian stiletto switchblades, with some convoluted exceptions. Maynard wouldn’t be able to buy one at a law-abiding “shop down the street,” as he does in the inaccurate version. In fact, the assisted opener in the corrected version may not even be available, but I gave Maynard the benefit of the doubt. With his assisted opener in hand, he’s free to intimidate Bill.
That intimidation proves effective when the assisted opening knife plays off the stigma of a switchblade's iconic pop-click sound. Bill folds and decides to tell Maynard about the money.
See how that worked? Assisted openers are the shortcut around switchblade laws. They offer all the benefits of switchblades with none of the legal hassle.
Butterfly Knives
Butterfly knives are great for characters with a streak for intimidation. They offer more sizzle than steak in the world of knives. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Popular butterfly knives: Benchmade 42 Bali-Song, Bear and Son Butterfly Knife, Bradley Kimura, Microtech Metalmark, Spyderco SpyderFly
A butterfly knife contains a blade positioned inside two handle halves. The handles are hinged into the blade. In the closed position, the handles conceal the blade. Swinging open one of the handle halves 360 degrees until it meets the other handle half exposes the blade. The two handles can attach to each other for a secure grip.
When you see a hoodlum in an action movie twirling a knife around in a flash of swirling metal just before a fight, he’s probably using a butterfly knife—and probably slicing his hand to pieces, unless he’s an experienced user.
Butterfly knives are also called balisong knives, or balisongs. It’s sometimes written as Bali-Song, which is a registered trademark of the Benchmade company. But butterfly knife is probably the safest choice when choosing a term to use.
Butterfly knives can be opened with one hand, but it takes some practice because they don’t have any automatic mechanisms. Beginners would likely use two hands. The operator manually controls all three moving parts (two handles and the blade).
Experienced users can open the blade quickly. Novices will still take their time. In other words, how fast the blade deploys doesn’t depend on a button, as it does for a switchblade. It’s dependent on user experience.
Advantages
There is a definite cool factor to butterfly knives. Experienced butterfly knife users can execute impressive tricks with them. Working the swinging handles is an art form unto itself. Take a look at videos of butterfly knife pros on YouTube—it’s pretty impressive to see them in action.
Unlike other knives with folding or moving blades, butterfly knives aren’t as prone to gumming up with lint and gunk because their design is looser.
Like switchblades, butterfly knives are ideal for intimidation and, therefore, for less savory characters. Law enforcement and military characters wouldn’t likely carry one, though, since they have access to modern automatic knives.
Butterfly knives are concealable and portable. They are perfect for stealthy characters.
In the hands of an experienced user, butterfly knives can quickly deploy their blades with one hand.
Unlike switchblades, which are designed specifically for stabbing, butterfly knives can handle light cutting, slicing, and stabbing.
The butterfly knife is the only type of knife that has two separate handles. This adds an extra measure of durability.
Disadvantages
Butterfly knives are for looks. There’s a reason butterfly knife demos are so popular on YouTube. They look cool, but they’re not practical. Characters who need to actually use the knife will probably opt for anything but a butterfly. Show-offs are a different story.
Many municipalities and states have restrictions regarding butterfly knives. Like switchblades, they’ve been targeted because of a perception that they’re used for violent and criminal activities. They’re still easier to come by than switchblades, though. Check regulations against a character’s setting.
In restricted areas, butterfly knives are red flags for suspicious activity. Characters wanting to keep on the down low won’t walk around with one.
Overall, butterfly knives are difficult to operate. If a character hasn’t put in the practice, there’s a good chance she could injure herself. Novices will need two hands to open this knife because it could do as much damage to the operator as it could a target.
Handles aren’t designed for ergonomics. In most cases, they’re straight and flat. A character could easily lose his grip in an intense situation.
Two handles means more weight than other types of knives.
Since they lack a long tang, butterfly knives aren’t as tough as fixed blade knives. They aren’t the best choice for hardcore cutting jobs.
The handles can be latched together while the blade is open, but that doesn’t mean they’re secure. The latch can slip open during operation and turn the handles loose. Likewise the latch can come undone while the knife is in the closed position.
The fastest butterfly knife is still slower than a fixed blade knife. That’s because fixed blade knives never need to be unfolded before use.
Inaccurate Example
“How’d you know where to find me?” said Bill Robber from his computer desk in the motel room.
“I checked your status on social media, ya coffin-varnished crowbaiter,” said Maynard Soloman.
“Yeah, but you should see the hashtag retweets I get,” Bill said.
“You’ll have plenty of time to tweet when you’re a gal-damn jailbird, hashtag shit-for-brains. Let’s go,” Maynard said and put a hand on the revolver holstered to his hip.
“Hashtag come and get it,” Bill said. He stood up and produced a butterfly knife, showing off his expertise with a few complicated twirls before taking a run at Maynard.
Maynard quickly drew his revolver and planted two well-placed shots into his assailant, dropping Bill to the floor.

“You’ll have plenty of time to tweet when you’re a gal-damn jailbird, hashtag shit-for-brains. Let’s go,” Maynard said and put a hand on the revolver holstered to his hip.
“Hashtag come and get it,” Bill said. He produced a butterfly knife and took a run at Maynard.
Maynard tried to draw his revolver, but after a brief struggle succumbed to Bill’s vicious knife attack. Bill limped away from the room, knife in hand, his leg and hands bleeding from the melee.
What Went Wrong
Did this one throw you off a little? At first, it would seem Maynard’s lethal revolver shots made sense. After all, a gun beats a knife, right?
That’s not always the case. See the Tueller Drill from the Myths section of this guide in Part Three. A character with a knife at distances of 21 feet or less can overcome a gun-toting individual before that person draws the handgun and fires. Maynard and Bill are in a motel room. It’s reasonable to assume they’re within 21 feet of each other. Therefore, Bill is able to get to Maynard and kill him before the detective can draw his revolver.
As for the butterfly knife, it’s tempting to write in a few tricks for the sake of intimidation. But Bill’s tricks waste precious time that could allow Maynard a shot. It’s always better to err on the side of practicality with knives, so the tricks don’t appear in the corrected version.
Now, I mentioned earlier that butterfly knives are for show. That’s true, but they’re still knives, and they can still injure other characters. Just consider how they perform during the action. Butterfly knives don’t offer much for ergonomics. Bill’s grip likely slipped during the life-and-death struggle with Maynard, leading to self-inflicted injuries. While these injuries are common to any intense knife action, they're even more likely to occur when a butterfly is involved. That’s why Bill’s leg and hands bleed as he leaves the room. Creative license might say otherwise, especially if Bill held a far superior physical advantage over Maynard, but you should consider self-inflicted injuries the default position.
Also, even if Maynard did manage to shoot Bill, keep in mind people don’t always succumb right away. Adrenaline might keep Bill alive long enough to stick the knife in Maynard.
One other thing. Although @MaynardSoloman is a real Twitter handle anyone reading this can tweet to, talking in hashtags is #obnoxious.
Fixed Blade Knives
The anatomy of a fixed blade knife. There are scores of styles, but the terms remain the same. This is a Bowie-style knife. (Image courtesy of BLADE.)
Popular fixed blade knives: A.G. Russell Sting, Benchmade Nimravus, Bowie knives (a style manufactured by many companies and individuals since at least the early 1800s), Kukri (a boomerang blade style made by many companies), Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, Applegate-Fairbairn fighting knife, KA-BAR USMC knife, machetes
Fixed blade knives sport blades that do not move. They are in a fixed position, attached to a handle or handle material. This is a broad category that includes many styles, from smaller knives with 3-inch blades to machetes with blades a foot long or longer.
Fixed blades are the toughest, most durable knives around. They can do it all: stab, slice, cut, chop, hack, slash, rib-split, meat-gnarl, shoulder-shovel, and any other colorful knife verb. This is because most fixed blade knives have a greater measure of tang. The tang may run down half the length of the handle or the full length (that knife would be said to have a full tang). Some tangs perform double duty, acting as the handle itself.
Full-tang knives can take more of a beating. Switchblades have a small tang or lack one entirely, which makes them more likely to fail. They’re just not intended for hard use. Better to write them for intimidation purposes. (Author’s photo.)
Because the blades don’t fold into the handle, fixed blade knives are usually transported in a sheath. The sheath may attach to a belt, or loop into a lanyard to be worn around the neck.
Fixed blades come in a variety of sizes and styles to match their purposes. This makes for some confusion with generic and branded names. Some knives are known by their brand name, such as Buck knife. Buck is a company that makes fixed blades, folding knives, and more. The generic term would be hunting knife. A buck knife also describes any generic hunting knife.
The same goes for KA-BAR. This term is sometimes used in place of a fixed blade, military-style knife. However, KA-BAR is a brand. If you are not using that specific brand of knife, use tactical knife instead, which refers to rugged knives designed for defense or combat.
Things are a little different with a Bowie knife, a term which can be used generically. Even though it’s capitalized, Bowie refers to a person—that’d be Jim Bowie—and not a company. Bowie took part in the infamous Sandbar Fight of 1827, a Louisiana brawl so brutal it cemented the style of his knife to the Bowie name.
A Bowie knife is defined as a fixed blade knife sporting a large blade with a concave curve toward the tip. It looks as if part of the spine (the unsharpened edge at the top of the blade) has been carved out. Bowie knives are great choices for characters set in the early 1800s through the present day. There’s some evidence that the style even may have been around since the late 1700s.
Adding yet another layer of confusion, a boot knife doesn’t necessarily refer to a knife that slips into footwear. This is a generic term for a short, slender knife. It might fit into a boot sheath, but it might not.
Remember to pair fixed blade knives with sheaths. As the examples later in this section show, sheaths are important considerations whenever figuring in a fixed blade knife.
Kitchen, butcher, and steak knives are also types of fixed blades, as are machetes. They are covered in depth in their own sections.
Advantages
Of any knife, fixed blades are the toughest. They can take a beating without fail. It all goes back to that tang. Fixed blades are the least likely to snap off. They’re ideal for a character going into a fight or for intense knife work, such as butchering or prying.
Unlike a switchblade or an assisted opener, a fixed blade knife is ready for use as is and will always be faster. No tabs to flip or buttons to press and no blade to unfold.
No moving parts means no worrying about pocket grime affecting how fast the knife opens. Sheaths keep blades clean and protected.
In stealth situations, characters wouldn’t have to worry about giving away their positions when drawing the blade. There isn’t a pop-click sound, as with switchblades and assisted opening knives. There may be some noise created by drawing a fixed blade from a sheath. Sheaths come in a variety of materials. Some are noisier than others, given they sometimes entail buttons and straps.
Fixed blades come in a variety of styles, making them ideal for thriller and crime-fiction characters. There are knives for fighting, camping, hunting, clearing, skinning, gutting, pruning, and, of course, fruit sampling.
Fixed blades are the least restricted of all the knives. A character would be able to find one just about anywhere. If they’re restricted, it’s usually because of blade length. Check real-world regulations against the setting. For example, a 6-inch blade might be illegal, but a 3-inch model would be okay.
Handles tend to be more ergonomic than other knives, since they’re not used for concealing the blade. Designs focus on materials and shapes that offer a secure grip. A character is less likely to lose hold of a fixed blade compared to other knives.
Fixed blade knives can be operated with one hand.
Disadvantages
Fixed blades lack the cool factor of switchblades and assisted opening knives. When they’re glamorized in movies, they’re usually big blades. Think of the one used in the Rambo movies. However, large knives may not be practical depending on the situation. Compared to smaller knives, they are harder to conceal, weigh more, and may be difficult to maneuver in a fight or surprise attack.
Sheaths are bulky and are dead giveaways for characters trying to conceal fixed blades. Sheaths worn around the neck and tucked under the shirt have become popular in recent years. Still, a character would have to wear a lanyard. This is the number one reason to go with a different kind of knife, such as a folding or assisted opening knife.
Inaccurate Example
Sitting in his RV, Maynard Soloman recalled the instructions from his mystery client earlier in the day: Sneak into the hospital’s VIP ward and cut a lock of hair from the patient in room 27. And just to be a jerk, steal a box of tissues to add a few thousand bucks to the patient’s bill.
Maynard pulled out the new assisted opening knife he’d purchased for the job. Using a ceramic rod, he worked the knife’s edge to a razor sharpness. Then he dropped the knife into his pocket, exited the RV, and headed across the parking lot to the hospital.
Accurate Example
Sitting in his RV, Maynard Soloman recalled the instructions from his mystery client earlier in the day: Sneak into the hospital’s VIP ward and cut a lock of hair from the patient in room 27. And just to be a jerk, steal a box of tissues to add a few thousand bucks to the patient’s bill.
Maynard examined the small dagger he’d brought along for the job. He fixed a sheath to his belt and slipped the knife inside, being sure to pull down his shirt to conceal it. He exited the RV and headed across the parking lot to the hospital.
What Went Wrong?
This one is tricky, since it involves anticipating what happens next in the hospital.
An assisted opening knife is going to make some noise when the blade is deployed. If silence is a must, which it might be given the VIP ward setting, this isn’t the right choice. A fixed blade knife, like the dagger (be sure to research local laws, since daggers are sometimes restricted), would add the necessary stealth to the equation. Maynard tucked the dagger’s sheath underneath his shirt. For those reasons, the fixed blade is the better choice.
Or is it? Accessing the sheath under Maynard’s shirt and drawing the knife could still make noise—maybe even more than the assisted opener would. It all depends on what happens inside the hospital.
Although I gave Maynard the fixed blade knife, it was a judgment call, one that’s tough to define. But it does drive home the point about anticipation. Will the knife selection work for scenes beyond the current one?
Still, there is one solid correction in the accurate example: Writers may use knife sharpening to build drama. As the section on sharpening shows, sometimes this makes sense and sometimes it doesn’t. There’s usually no reason to sharpen a brand-new knife. They come sharpened and ready to use right out of the box.
Folding Knives and Pocketknives
Popular folding and pocketknives: Buck 110, Benchmade Griptilian, Columbia River Knife & Tool Ripple, Spyderco Delica, Spyderco Endura
Pocketknives are sometimes called folding knives. Either term is correct for writing fiction. They refer to the same thing: knives with one or more blades that are manually moved in and out of the handle. There are no mechanisms to assist with the opening or closing of the knife.
There are a number of ways to open a pocketknife. The most common nowadays are a fingernail notch, thumb stud, or tab that flips the blade open (these are sometimes called flippers). Pocketknives in the early twentieth century used a number of innovative methods, such as metal rings.
Pocketknives and folding knives don’t have to be small. They come in a variety of sizes. Some use a lock; others don’t.
Like other knives, folders fall victim to the “Kleenex effect”—no matter the brand, people call all folders the same thing. The terms Buck knife and buck knife are sometimes used to mean any folding hunting knife. The iconic Buck 110, one of the most popular folding knives of all time, is the origin of these terms. Use Buck knife when referring to the 110 or a knife made by the Buck company, and buck knife when using the term generically for any hunting knife.
Pocketknives enjoy a rosy place not only in the history of American culture but also across the planet. They’re easy to buy and usually legal to possess. Pop them into a story without worry.
Advantages
These knives are easy to conceal and transport.
Their simple designs make them great choices for characters unfamiliar with knives.
Characters would have no problem buying a folding knife or pocketknife. What few restrictions exist address blade length.
Some pocketknives come with multiple blades, a feature that increases versatility and reliability. If one blade goes dull, you can use another.
These knives come in a variety of styles and designs to fit any number of needs. Some of the aforementioned flipper designs can open as fast as assisted openers.
Most modern pocketknives come with pocket clips. This reduces the collection of lint and grime on the knife, which can affect how fast the blade opens. Clips also make the knives more accessible.
Disadvantages
In general, folders and pocketknives lack the cool factor that fiction likes to employ. When selecting a knife to help flesh out a character (figuratively speaking, of course), folders will probably match an occupation, a hobby, or a task rather than establish the kind of street cred that assisted openers, switchblades, automatics, and butterfly knives can offer.
Most folders and pocketknives must be opened with two hands. If they can be opened with one hand, doing so requires extra attention. This fact could slow down a character in a fight, reveal the character’s concealed position, or prevent the knife’s use entirely depending on the scene.
Locks range from secure advanced designs to nothing at all. That means the blade can close on a character’s hand during hard use. Consider how much of a beating the knife will take. It might help to identify a particular model to determine whether it uses a modern locking mechanism.
Inaccurate Example
Although it felt good to see him in dire straights, Maynard Soloman didn’t want Bill Robber to die in an overturned car. Maynard couldn’t collect the bounty on Bill’s head if the fugitive was dead.
Maynard took the Buck knife out of his pocket, unfolded the blade, and aimed the tip at the driver’s side window. The glass shattered, but the opening wasn’t large enough to pull Bill out. Maynard pried at the mangled driver’s side door with the knife until it opened. Breathing hard, Maynard managed to tug Bill’s unconscious body away from the car.
“Thank goodness you’re so gal-damn stupid, Bill,” Maynard said. “If you’d worn a seat belt, your sorry carcass would still be in there.”
Accurate Example
Although it felt good to see him in dire straights, Maynard Soloman didn’t want Bill Robber to die in an overturned car. Maynard couldn’t collect the bounty on Bill’s head if the fugitive was dead.
Maynard unsheathed a Bowie knife and aimed the glass-breaking stud on its pommel at the driver’s side window. The glass shattered, but the opening wasn’t large enough to pull Bill out. Maynard pried at the mangled driver’s side door with the knife until it opened. Breathing hard, Maynard managed to tug Bill’s unconscious body away from the car.
“Thank goodness you’re so gal-damn stupid, Bill,” Maynard said. “If you’d worn a seat belt, your sorry carcass would still be in there.”
What Went Wrong?
The inaccurate example actually gets an important detail right. Remember: The term Buck knife indicates either a knife made by the Buck company (which makes folding and fixed blade hunting knives) or the Buck 110, an iconic pocketknife. Both are consistent with Maynard removing the knife from his pocket and unfolding a blade.
Things went awry when Maynard used the knife to rescue Bill. First, stabbing a window with the tip of a knife probably won’t shatter the glass. If it does, it’ll likely come at the expense of the tip or the operator’s fingers—vehicle windows are hard and slippery. Second, a folding knife isn’t the best pick for prying open mangled car doors. Because the folding knife lacks a tang, the blade will likely break off.
Both concerns are eliminated when Maynard uses a Bowie, a type of fixed blade knife. As explained in the section on fixed blade knives, a Bowie knife—even when capitalized—is a generic term for a certain style, not brand, of knife. That allows some wiggle room for Maynard to have a convenient glass-breaker stud on the Bowie’s pommel (the bottom of the knife handle). Toss in the assumption that the Bowie knife is built for hard use, and Maynard can successfully pry open the car door.
As for that seat-belt reference, I just wanted Maynard to get in a zinger. Had Bill been wearing a seat belt, Maynard would’ve used his knife to cut it in both examples. Keep in mind that there are knives with seat-belt cutters built into them. That’s explained in the section on survival knives.
Kitchen, Butcher, and Steak Knives
Butcher knives have a long history in the horror genre. Ever wonder why slasher villains carry them in their hands like ice cream cones everywhere they go? It’s because butcher knives don’t usually come with sheaths. Their lack of portability might be a concern for characters on the move. (Photo courtesy of Chuck Ward for BLADE.)
Popular brands: Al Mar, Calphalon, Ginsu, J.A. Henckels, Shun
These are the knives people around the world use every day. They are the most commonly owned of any knife, and therefore available to all characters. Their ubiquity means they can pop up in almost any scene. However, there are still a few considerations to make before writing them into your book.
This category of knives is generically called cutlery. It’s still accurate to use butcher knife when being specific. It’s redundant to write kitchen cutlery or steak cutlery. Use kitchen knife or steak knife instead.
A Ginsu knife is sometimes used generically, but it’s more appropriate when referring specifically to the Ginsu brand. Go with chef’s knife, butcher knife, or another generic term instead.
Kitchen, butcher, and steak knives are fixed blades 99 percent of the time, but they don’t all sport tangs. Tangs make a big difference with how much of a beating a knife can take. The cheaper the knife, the less likely it has much of a tang. Higher-quality knives will probably include a lengthy, or full, tang.
From my experience reading fiction, knives from the kitchen are often thrown at target characters. While any aerial knife can be dangerous, there are reasons knife throwing rarely works. Remember that old circus trick where the magician throws butcher knives at a spinning wheel? Those weren’t the same knives most people have in their kitchens—they were throwing knives. Throwing knives focus their weight (center of gravity) in the middle. This helps them spin without veering off course.
A meat cleaver is an example of a knife that’s not suited for throwing, although fiction uses them quite a bit for that purpose. These knives focus almost all of their weight on a formidable blade to help with chopping jobs. Factor in that they lack a tip, and meat cleavers aren’t ideal choices for throwing.
One characteristic of these knives that’s often overlooked is blade flexibility. Cutlery is usually more flexible than other types of knives. They’re manufactured that way for durability given their frequent use (a knife that can bend instead of break will last longer). This trait can be good or bad depending on the scene you’re writing, but it’s worth considering. The knives in your kitchen right now aren’t the same ones found in the sheaths of first responders and military personnel for a reason.
Advantages
It’s virtually a guarantee these knives are in every home in the world. A character would certainly have access to them. They’re perfect for characters in a pinch.
These are the easiest knives to buy. Who doesn’t need a steak knife?
Because they are so common, kitchen knives don’t draw suspicion when presented in everyday situations. Is the steak knife on the kitchen counter going to be used for eating dinner or something nefarious? No one will know until it’s too late.
Kitchen, butcher, and steak knives are ready for use as is. There’s no learning curve and no blade to open. They will always be faster than switchblades or assisted openers.
In stealth situations, characters needn’t worry about revealing their positions due to the sound of the blade opening.
Kitchen, butcher, and steak knives are designed for cutting power. If a character needs to butcher someone or something, these knives will maximize each cut.
In fiction, there’s something especially sinister about using such a mundane knife for murder and mayhem.
Disadvantages
Portability is the number one disadvantage to kitchen, butcher, and steak knives. These knives rarely have accompanying sheaths, since it’s unusual for them to leave the kitchen. If they do go anywhere, it’s usually in a box. They’re best for scenes around the home, unless a character feels like walking around holding a knife for everyone to see.
Cutlery found outside its normal environment can raise suspicions. A meat cleaver with blood on it means something different when discovered in the garage instead of, say, the kitchen.
Kitchen, butcher, and steak knives are not designed for fighting. That doesn’t mean they can’t be used for violent tasks. It does mean that they come with disadvantages in combat. For example, a meat cleaver is only effective when chopping or hacking. It’s no good for stabbing since it doesn’t have a tip. Steak knives may seem a good choice, but they usually have flexible blades. It’s possible the blade could become bent in a fight. And a chef’s knife looks menacing, but its delicate edge is intended for precise slicing and dicing. The edge might dull up during the intense knife work fiction can demand.
These knives tend to be on the larger side. The larger the knife, the harder it is to control in a struggle and the greater the chance the character using it will hurt himself.
Inaccurate Example
“Back in the day, the priest told us we’d go blind if we didn’t stop it with all the selfies,” said Maynard Soloman as he snapped a photo of himself with Bill Robber’s unconscious body on the floor. “Nowadays, it’s a different story. I like to tweet the lowlifes I catch.”
Except Bill, ever the fraudster, wasn’t unconscious at all. From the floor of Maynard’s RV, he waited for the right moment, then jumped to his feet. Bill bolted to the RV’s kitchenette and grabbed a long Ginsu knife from the kitchen cutlery.
Before Maynard could react, Bill hurled the knife into the detective’s chest. Without pausing, Maynard snapped off the blade lodged in his sternum and chucked it back at Bill. The Ginsu knife clipped Bill’s jugular as it twirled past. A cascade of obscenities cluttered the night air as each realized they wouldn’t live to watch the other die.
Accurate Example

Except Bill, ever the fraudster, wasn’t unconscious at all. From the floor of Maynard’s RV, he waited for the right moment, then jumped to his feet. Bill bolted to the RV’s kitchenette and grabbed a long chef’s knife from a drawer.
Before Maynard could react, Bill hurled the knife at the detective’s chest. The blade’s handle connected with a thump before the knife fell to the floor.
“Speaking of church, now would be a good time to go back to pretending to be asleep,” Maynard said as he unholstered his revolver.
What Went Wrong?
The term Ginsu knife often stands in for a generic butcher knife or chef’s knife. I don’t think the term warrants the “Kleenex Effect,” though. Ginsu is a company that makes cutlery. Go with the generic term instead. Also, using kitchen cutlery is redundant. Swap in some other generic term, or eliminate it outright.
Throwing a knife is tough to do, even with the right conditions and the proper blade. Chances are good that Bill’s toss wouldn’t connect with Maynard’s chest.
Creative license might say otherwise and work in a hit anyway. In that case, Maynard probably wouldn’t snap off the blade. Remember that cutlery is designed for flexibility. He could bend it until it breaks, but that’s not much comfort when the knife is plugged into his sternum. In fact, it could make the injury worse. Snapping or bending is more dramatic, but the better route, had that knife made a hit in the first place, might be for Maynard to simply pull the blade out.
That scenario works only if Maynard is physically able to do it. Prior examples have pointed out that this particular character has stubby arms and a wide chest. Is he capable enough, while injured, to pull out a long chef’s knife? Physical traits are worth considering every time a character picks up a knife or firearm.
Survival Knives and Multi-Tools
Popular multi-tools: Swiss army knife (a generic type, not a specific model), any number of Gerber models, any number of Leatherman models, CRKT Guppie
A survival knife is defined less by its physical characteristics and more by how it’s used. Sometimes it’s just a fixed or folding knife. Other times it’s a knife combined with tools.
As survival instructor Creek Stewart writes in his book Build the Perfect Bug Out Bag, a survival knife should be able to assist with at least a few of the following:
cutting
hunting
dressing game
building shelters
digging
defending oneself
splitting or chopping wood (when done with a knife, this is called batoning)
making fire
carving
signaling for help
building shelter
preparing food
A number of tools might be built into a survival knife to help make it even more ubiquitous, including a flashlight, a screwdriver, a USB drive, a fire striker, a seat belt cutter (a notch in the handle with a sharpened edge inside), a glass breaker (a stud on the bottom of the handle for breaking windows), eating utensils, and signal whistles. But once all those tools start to overshadow the blade, it’s no longer a survival knife. It’s a multi-tool.
The classic multi-tool is the Swiss army knife, which has been around since the 1880s. The term Swiss army knife is generic, and it’s appropriate to write it that way. In the knife world and in catalogs, it’s sometimes abbreviated as SAK.
Only two knife companies can lay claim to the Swiss army knife in any official sense: Victorinox and Wenger. Still, the best bet is to write Swiss army knife generically and have it contain the tools needed for the scene.
The other commonly used, generic multi-tool is the Leatherman. Whereas the Swiss army knife resembles a typical pocketknife (but often with the trademark red color), a Leatherman is more like a pair of pliers. The Leatherman Tool Group introduced the first one in 1983, billed as the Leatherman Pocket Survival Tool. It exploded in popularity and spawned countless imitators, resulting in the generic term Leatherman. Although there are scores of varieties and manufacturers (most notably Gerber), it’s still appropriate to use Leatherman generically when referencing such a multi-tool. Just don’t lowercase the L.
Advantages
Dedicated survival knives—those without any tools attached—are built with hard use in mind. Fixed blade survival knife designs take full advantage of tangs, modern metals, handle materials, and ergonomics to take a dump truck’s worth of hell. They are the true do-it-all knives, the ones to have handy in survival situations and fight scenes. Folding survival knives are made with the same mentality, but they’re not as durable since they lack the tang of fixed blades.
Survival knives with tools attached can work wonders in your fictional scenes. The best tools are those without electronic or moving parts that are integral to the knife itself. Glass breakers, seat-belt cutters, and wrenches are among the tools that work well in reality. Any character, especially first responders and criminals, can take advantage of these features.
Multi-tools’ primary advantage is found right in their name. They’re like portable toolboxes. For characters requiring versatility, they’re a great pick.
Disadvantages
Not every tool attached to a survival knife works out in reality. Fire strikers are notorious for failing to light anything in the field. Built-in flashlights drastically cut down on the knife’s durability. Have the character use separate, dedicated items instead.
Has anyone actually used the toothpick in a Swiss army knife? Multi-tools suffer from diminishing returns, trading practicality for variety. For small, low-impact tasks, they’re great. But a dedicated tool on its own will almost always do a better job than the one in a multi-tool.
Multi-tools aren’t suited for combat. Avoid writing them into fight scenes if at all possible.
Inaccurate Example
For the third time that week, Maynard Soloman locked his keys inside his beloved RV. To further complicate the situation, he’d just spotted his arch nemesis, Bill Robber, fresh out of jail and steaming toward him like a freight train on fire from across the parking lot.
Maynard reached into his pocket and pulled out his trusty Swiss army knife. He unfolded a long, thin blade and picked the lock on the driver’s side door in a snap.
“What in the dank hell?” Maynard said after he secured himself inside the RV. His fingers fell on a metallic bulge near his trouser luggage. “Aw, horsefeathers, the keys were in my pocket the whole time.”
Accurate Example
For the third time that week, Maynard Soloman locked his keys inside his beloved RV. Fortunately, the RV already had three wheels in the grave. Busting a window wouldn’t ruin the quaint aesthetics.
Maynard reached into his pocket and pulled out his trusty folding knife, the one that would make MacGyver proud. He made a short, sharp jab at one of the windows with the glass breaker on the bottom of the knife’s handle.
The window shattered, allowing Maynard access to unlock the door. He didn’t act fast enough, though. Bill caught up with Maynard just in time and grabbed a sleeve through the shattered window.
Maynard reached over and clocked Bill with the glass breaker. It took a few hard blows to make Bill feel anything through his thick skull, but he finally relented and let Maynard go.
Safe inside the RV, Maynard flicked on the flashlight attached to the knife’s handle in an attempt to find the keys. But the intense blows to Bill’s skull had knocked the light out of commission.
“What in the dank hell?” Maynard said when his fingers fell on a metallic bulge near his trouser luggage. “Aw, horsefeathers, the keys were in my pocket the whole time.”
What Went Wrong?
Here’s an instance where switching up the knife led to more problems to address.
Let’s kick it off with the lock picking, something that pops up in fiction. Swiss army knives can offer many tools, but it’d take a real expert to figure out how to pick a lock with one. Maynard needs to act quickly, so picking the RV door in a few seconds falls a bit beyond the suspension of disbelief.
Where does this trope come from then? Its genesis can probably be traced to opening standard doors, like those in a home, with a knife. Slipping a knife between the lock and the door frame and giving the knife a twist will usually “pop the lock,” allowing access.
Those simple locks are a whole other kettle of fish compared to car doors and secured entries. Those cases call for specialized tools for accessing the locks themselves. Even if such tools are present on a Swiss army knife, it’s going to take some time and talent.
A better choice for Maynard is that “trusty folding knife,” the one that would make MacGyver proud. Although it’s not stated explicitly, it's a survival knife given its glass breaker and built-in flashlight. That’s the nice thing about survival knives—they can match a writer’s imagination and needs. In this case, Maynard used the glass breaker to shatter the window and hit Bill in the head.
As for the flashlight, it became damaged in the struggle with Bill and wouldn’t turn on, which highlights the trade-off of survival knives. The knives themselves are cut out for hard use. The extra features built into the knives often aren’t. Parts may come loose, fall off, or fail to work. That was the case with the flashlight.
However, that struggle would never have happened had Maynard not broken the window in the first place. In fact, switching to the survival knife only complicated things for this scene.
So was the extra hassle worth it? The answer depends on the writer. This is a time creative license might’ve simplified things by having the doors on Maynard’s decrepit RV unlock with the Swiss army knife. Or maybe Maynard’s an experienced lock picker.
That’s a judgment call every writer will have to make eventually when it comes to knives and firearms. Do you apply creative license to keep the story moving or play it closer to reality? As a reader, I appreciate the extra time a writer takes to get those things right, but you may think differently.
Machetes
Popular brands of machetes: SOG, United Cutlery, Ontario Knife Company, Gerber
When does a standard fixed blade knife become a machete? It’s mostly a length thing. Machete blades are long—up to a foot or more—and are designed for hacking. They’re the limb takers of fiction.
Machetes are common tropes in horror, war, and survival fiction, though slightly less so in crime and mystery stories, unless your character is particularly vicious. Machetes come in many designs, not just the prototypical jungle-clearing hacker.
One for writers to consider for limb work—trees and otherwise—is the kukri (aka khukuri, khukri, and about a dozen other spellings). This knife’s blade looks like a boomerang from hell, with an edge running along the inside of the curve. The kukri traces its roots back to Nepal, where people used it for centuries for fieldwork and combat. It’s since found use in modern militaries around the world. The secret is the design: The boomerang shape focuses most of its weight toward the front, making it a highly efficient chopper. Not that a run-of-the-mill machete won’t cut it, but writers looking for an exceptionally devastating way to take off a character’s head or limb should consider the kukri.
Because of their size, all machetes need sheaths. Be it a proper sheath or a rolled up newspaper, consider how the machete is transported when writing about it. Because of their bulk, many machetes come with a lanyard for looping around the wrist. This keeps them from flying out of the operator’s hand.
Some machetes come with sawlike teeth built into them, usually on the spine, or top, of the blade. In that case, the model is referred to as a sawtooth or sawback machete. As the name suggests, these teeth are useful for sawing materials, although a proper saw works better for tasks like this. A character with a wicked streak could put that feature to creative use.
Advantages
Machetes are a favorite of fiction, and for good reason. A blow from a machete is absolutely devastating. They’re the perfect choice for inflicting brutal injuries on other characters.
Because of their obvious cutting power, machetes are ideal for intimidation. A character with a machete makes a statement without uttering a word.
Machetes offer a great deal of utility outside of combat, too. They can tackle almost any large cutting job, from clearing brush to splitting wood. Their versatility earns them a high ranking on the list of survival tools.
Like all fixed blade knives, machetes offer plenty of durability. A machete isn’t likely to break. Feel free to hack, chop, and slash away.
A razor-sharp machete isn’t necessary and actually performs poorly. Machetes are designed for blunt force. A supersharp edge isn’t going to stand up to this hard use. Think of machetes as you would axes. Staying relatively sharp is important but not to the high degree of a standard fixed blade knife. For this reason, sharpening a machete for intimidation might be unnecessary.
Disadvantages
The best thing about machetes—their size—is also the worst. Compared to other knives, machetes are clunky to operate. All that weight swinging around must be controlled without unintentionally injuring the operator or someone else. It takes practice to use them effectively. An inexperienced character, or one that’s not physically strong, would find it difficult to use a machete. If you’re having trouble picturing it, imagine your character using an ax: There’s a windup, a swing, contact, and follow-through. It’s all about controlling that heavy blade.
Portability is an issue with machetes. They’re bulky and tough to conceal. Characters requiring stealth may want to choose something else.
Because machetes aren’t supposed to be razor sharp, they’re not as useful for detailed cutting tasks. Big, blunt cutting jobs are best.
Running with machetes, just like scissors, is incredibly dangerous. Fiction seems to forget that, but it’s also an easy area to suspend disbelief. Sheathe the damn thing.
Inaccurate Example
They say alcohol and machetes don’t mix, but Maynard Soloman put his mind to proving them wrong. After the bar closed, he paid a visit to Bill Robber, an ex-con on parole and living in a van down by the river.
Maynard stripped down to his underwear, crawled on top of the van after a few failed attempts, and hacked at the roof with the machete until he could see a startled Bill inside.
“What the hell are you doing?” Bill said as he sprinted outside the van.
“Just doing a welfare check, that’s all,” Maynard said.
“Are you drunk?” Bill said.
“Nope, I’m sober as a judge,” Maynard said. He shaved a few whiskers from his chin to prove his point.
Accurate Example
They say alcohol and machetes don’t mix, but Maynard Soloman put his mind to proving them wrong. After the bar closed, he paid a visit to Bill Robber, an ex-con currently on parole and living in a van down by the river.
Maynard stripped down to his underwear, crawled on top of the van after a few failed attempts, and hacked at the roof with the machete.
“What the hell are you doing?” Bill said as he sprinted outside the van.
“Just doing a welfare check, that’s all,” Maynard said.
“Are you drunk?” Bill said.
“Nope, I’m sober as a judge,” Maynard said as blood trickled down his bare chest and legs.
What Went Wrong?
Let’s first address the most obvious question: Could a machete hack through the roof of a van? Actually, this is possible, given machetes are perfect for brutal hacking tasks. It depends on the quality of the machete and the condition of the roof. I toned this down in the corrected version because I didn’t think Bill would wait until Maynard installed a new sunroof to exit the van.
Now for the shaving bit. The Internet is full of knife companies showing their machetes hacking down trees and shaving hair or paper only seconds later. The point is to demonstrate the resiliency of the blade edges. It’s a little misleading, since the tree and hair are cut at different spots along the machete’s edge.
That said, a machete can certainly shave hair, but it’s really not set up for precise cutting tasks in the first place. These weapons are built for hacking. Even a machete that has not been sharpened will be effective for cutting trees, brush, and, yes, other characters. But the blade’s edge probably won’t shave hair after hard use.
And that hard use is sure to send debris flying, something to keep in mind whenever machetes are used. A bare-chested Maynard would become injured after hacking on that roof, as in the corrected version. He may also have struck himself with the machete, since it would be hard to control, even when sober. Keep that in mind whenever a character uses one of these blades.
Finally, where is the sheath in this scene? Or is there one? Whenever you’re writing about a fixed blade knife, always consider how (or if) the character is carrying the sheath. If the machete is loose in Maynard’s hand, he may have injured himself while drunkenly climbing the van.
Throwing Knives
Popular brands of throwing knives: SOG, United Cutlery, Hibben, Cold Steel
It’s possible for any knife or edged object to be thrown and to hit a target, but it takes skill and a knife that’s specifically designed for throwing to do it reliably. For this reason, throwing knives are considered a separate type altogether and carry their own considerations for a story.
Throwing knives come in a variety of sizes, from finger length to as long as a forearm. Many throwing knives work because their weight is focused near the center. The blade and handle are often tapered. This encourages the knife to spin, which keeps it from veering off course. This variety of throwing knife is most difficult to master.
Other throwing knives are designed so that their weight is focused at the handle or blade instead, and sometimes both. They’re somewhat easier to throw.
No-spin throwing knives are designed to do exactly that—they don’t spin. The weight is distributed more or less evenly across the knife. Because of this design, some resemble spikes instead of knives, and when that is the case, they’re called throwing spikes. They’re a popular choice with those new to throwing knives.
It might surprise some to know that most throwing knives don’t have sharpened edges. The only part that needs to stick into a target is the tip. A sharpened edge wouldn’t serve much of a purpose other than to cut the thrower. That’s why hurling knives that aren’t designed for throwing is such a bad idea, especially when the thrower is inexperienced. The edge could catch the thrower’s hand or other body part.
Knives and spikes don’t have a monopoly on aerial edges. Axes, hatchets, and tomahawks are also good choices, so long as they focus weight on the blade. They’re easier to throw successfully than knives, but it still takes practice and physical acumen to properly use them.
Advantages
Nothing screams stealth like an attack with a throwing knife. This weapon offers an attack that won’t make the noise of a firearm. This makes them ideal for ambushes by assassins and other covert characters.
Throwing knives can quickly establish a character’s weapon know-how. Because they require a lot of practice to master, and due to their relatively low popularity, a character handy with throwing knives likely possesses advanced weapons skills.
Throwing knives can serve as a last-ditch weapon in a fight. Any number of smaller throwing knives can be secured to a character.
A hit from a throwing knife can be devastating. The kinetic energy focused on the tip upon impact means the blade will likely penetrate well beyond a mere flesh wound.
Disadvantages
Throwing knives, and even axes or hatchets, require a lot of practice to master. Characters wouldn’t be able to pick up the skill in an afternoon. A concerted effort must be made in order to learn the skill and develop muscle memory.
Throwing knives, as well as axes and hatchets, lack range. They’re usually good to about 20 feet at most, depending on the thrower. Accuracy is greatly reduced beyond that distance.
Here’s something those trick knife throwers at circuses and magic shows won’t tell their audiences: They become really good at throwing to a specific range but are terrible at other distances. This is because of the muscle memory required to throw accurately. Move them out of their comfort zone, and the accuracy of their throws suffers. Although an exceptionally skilled character in fiction might do well at any range, keep this point in mind.
Body positioning has to be perfect for an accurate throw. This means being able to stand up with enough room for an overhead toss. Fiction likes to feature characters hurling knives in contorted positions for dramatic effect. Accuracy would certainly suffer in those cases. The slightest rotation of the wrist can throw a knife well off its target.
For all of these reasons, much of knife throwing is just choreographed stunt work. It’s cool to watch and imagine, but these trick throws need near-perfect conditions to work.
Inaccurate Example
“I’m interested to know your opinion,” said Bill Robber to Maynard Soloman. He held his signature throwing knife up to the bound detective’s throat. “Do you want me to slit your throat or your wrists?”
“There was a time when people cared about my two cents, but inflation took care of that,” Maynard said. His flabby arms struggled against the extension cord tying him to the lamppost in Bill’s backyard. “How about you cut me loose and we can chew the fat on it?”
“Since it’ll stop your one-liners, I think I’ll start with your throat,” Bill said and opened Maynard’s neck with the edge of the razor-sharp blade. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, my bowling league meets in fifteen minutes.”
Accurate Example
“I’m interested to know your opinion,” said Bill Robber to Maynard Soloman. He held his signature fillet knife up to the bound detective’s throat. “Do you want me to cut out your throat or your wrists?”
“There was a time when people cared about my two cents, but inflation took care of that,” Maynard said. His flabby arms struggled against the extension cord tying him to the lamppost in Bill’s backyard. “How about you cut me loose and we can chew the fat on it?”
“If it’ll stop the one-liners, I think I’ll start with your throat,” Bill said and filleted Maynard’s throat open. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, my bowling league meets in fifteen minutes.”
What Went Wrong?
The edges of throwing knives aren’t sharpened, so Bill wouldn’t slit Maynard’s throat with one. He’d have to use the point instead.
Even so, a throwing knife wasn’t the right fit in the first place. Just as other knife types aren’t cut out for hurling across a scene, throwing knives aren’t the sharpest choice outside of aerial attacks.
To switch things up, I gave Bill a fillet knife (a flexible fixed blade knife used for cleaning fish) instead.
Straight Razors
A straight razor refers to a shaving blade that folds into a handle. These are sometimes called cutthroat razors. Because of their centuries-spanning use (they’ve been around since about the 1600s), straight razors are appropriate for characters in just about any setting.
Straight razors are best used for the intimidation and mutilation of characters. They’re not designed for fighting, since their manufacturers (hopefully) didn’t have violence in mind for their products.
The thin edge on a straight razor is what drives that legendary sharpness. Cutting is all about the dispersal of force through the metal of the blade. The thinnest edges, like those on straight razors, concentrate the most force in the smallest area. Sharpening and stropping provide the thin edge with a row of microscopic teeth to bite into what’s being cut (dull edges are roundish and lack those teeth). The teeth make it possible for a razor to cut things that would usually bend instead of break, like hair or whiskers.
Straight razors are often stropped against a piece of leather or other material before use. This freshens the edge in two ways: first, by cleaning off any debris, and second, by aligning the grains of the metal so that they stand up, providing that row of teeth.
Advantages
Most straight razors are foldable, making them exceptionally concealable. They’re perfect for stealthy characters.
The TSA may not allow passengers to stow them inside carry-ons, but straight razors are mundane enough that they won’t raise suspicion elsewhere. No one will think twice about the character with a straight razor in the bathroom.
Straight razors are designed for finesse work. This means a character carving a cryptic message into a victim’s backside will appreciate the penlike delicacy of a straight razor.
They’re tricky to shave with, but straight razors don’t carry quite the same learning curve when it comes to mutilation. That supersharp edge makes it easy to claim an ear or throat.
Compared to other knives, there’s a special brutality about giving a nefarious character a straight razor.
Disadvantages
The thin edge that makes razors so sharp is cursed to require constant refreshing. Because the edge is so thin, it doesn’t take long for the grains in the metal to roll over. Stropping can straighten those grains back up.
That thin edge also means hard use is out of the question. Mutilation, intimidation, and quick cutting are all appropriate, but straight razors are too flimsy and prone to failure for anything else.
Straight razors lack a tip. This is great when a barber shaves near the throat in the real world. In fiction, it can be inconvenient. It means razors aren’t cut out for stabbing.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman waited in his RV at the stakeout. The job was simple: Identify the door-to-door missionary collecting donations for a nonexistent school in Africa. All he had to do was wait for the knock.
Since the missionary had a higher power on his side, Maynard sharpened his old-fashioned straight razor to even the odds. He turned on an electric knife sharpener and let the spinning wheels grind the razor for a minute or so. That’s when he heard the knock.
Maynard opened the door to a mustached man in a cheap suit and slicked back hair. The missionary launched into a rehearsed speech about the meaning of life.
“Yeah, yeah, this is all fascinating stuff. But I’ve found that the more someone says they have a purpose on this planet, the less they actually do. I call BS on you,” Maynard said.
The missionary was about to respond, but his mustache dislodged from his lip and fluttered to the ground.
“Well, I’ll be dipped. If it isn’t Bill Robber, failing at another crummy disguise,” Maynard said.
Bill turned to run, but not before Maynard could hurl the razor into his back.

What Went Wrong?
I’ll let you in on a little knife humor: What do you call a straight razor that’s sharpened in an electric knife grinder? A stick. (Please, hold your applause. I’m here all night, ladies and gentlemen.)
Electric knife sharpeners (basically two abrasive wheels that spin inside a small tabletop machine) are great for removing metal to form a new edge. The problem is that straight razors, because they’re so thin, don’t have a lot of metal to remove in the first place. An electric knife sharpener will eventually “eat” the razor. Even before that happens, it’ll ruin the razor by warping it with heat and by replacing the edge with another angle not cut out for shaving. That’s why when razors do require sharpening, the job is done manually to control angle and temperature.
Stropping (lightly running the edge of the blade over a durable but soft material) is always a good idea for a razor. This straightens grains of metal that have rolled over, causing the edge to dull. That’s why barbers strop their straight razors before a shave instead of going to a sharpener. Anything more than a quick refresh of the finely tuned edge is overkill. Maynard uses a typical leather belt for his stropping, although alternatives such as newsprint and cloth work, too.
As discussed in other sections, hurling anything that isn’t a throwing knife isn’t usually effective. That goes double for straight razors—they lack a tip. A quick slice, as in the accurate example, is the better route.
