A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and the AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. She can help him with this, but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. As long as he can stay in his role as protector he doesn’t care where she is guided. As an asset he can help ensure her safety as she carries out her mission.
He can be a drawback if he refuses to take her seriously or believe in her. He can cause her to doubt herself and her task. He may also cause her to fear situations whether there is danger present or not.
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. This is just fine for the Protector. He loves to travel and move around. She just better not try to make him stop watching out for her, especially if he believes in her cause.
