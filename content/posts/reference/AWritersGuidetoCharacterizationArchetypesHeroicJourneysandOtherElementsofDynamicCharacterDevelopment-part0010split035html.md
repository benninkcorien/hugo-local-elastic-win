A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivates the Maiden. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings. These are things the Maiden needs to work on too so they may be too much alike for their own good. She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times, and captures his attention easily.
He may enjoy being the only risk taker because it makes him different, so he may not like her taking part in his adventures.
She must learn to stand on her own two feet. The Fool may not have the means to support her, and therefore she will have to become self-sufficient.
They won’t necessarily be there for each other physically. He will be off playing around and so will she. But they can meet on an emotional level. They both share the same experiences and have a hard time fitting in with ‘normal’ society.
Both of them can feel validated and renewed in each other’s company. They are kindred souls, however they may lack the resources to take care of themselves responsibly, unless one of them has come up with an invention or something of the sort that gives them a steady flow of income.
If she gets pregnant, things can get touchy for them. She will be forced to be responsible. He will also feel the pressure.
