A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
The AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. This is something the Seductive Muse can help with. She can teach him to go with the flow of life, and she can give him the confidence to face his doubts.
She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks. The Male Messiah is able to see a woman for her inner beauty, to see beyond her exterior. He will recognize her brains and her spirit within, but will she recognize her own assets? He can help her with this, but she may not enjoy the way he goes about it. He can really push people to change.
The Seductive Muse loves to be around people who are in touch with their bodies and their creative sides. She loves to play and explore, and anything kinesthetic.
He may see her as a wonderful confidant. His whole world seems to open up when she is around. He never knew the physical world could hold so much beauty and wonder. She is a true muse to him.
Or he may see her as a deterrent—someone leading him astray when he wants to focus on his tasks.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. He isn’t looking for a traditional family life. He may have one, but it doesn’t top his list of desires.
She loves a take-charge kind of guy, which he is. But she wants someone who can be there for her, someone who will explore the sensual side of life with her. He’s not so inclined.
The Male Messiah may see the Seductive Muse as fun and adventurous, but a little too intense for his taste. He doesn’t know what to make of her at times and may feel a little off balance around her. If he has hang-ups about sex, they will clash.
