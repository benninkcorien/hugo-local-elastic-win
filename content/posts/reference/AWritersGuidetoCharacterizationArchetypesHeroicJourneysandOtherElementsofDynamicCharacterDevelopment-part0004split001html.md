A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
PERSONALITY TYPOLOGY
“The least of things with meaning, is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.” —Carl Jung
While Jung is known primarily for his work on archetypes, he also developed a personality typology that sheds light on how humans approach life. This typology focuses on two types: Introverts and Extroverts. Within these two types each individual also uses one (or more) of four functions as a primary way of dealing with information and circumstances that come his or her way. The four functions are: sensing, thinking, intuiting, and feeling.
What follows is an overview of the four functions and how each one applies to writing and to individual archetypes.
Introversion or extroversion will act as the core of your character and determine how that character relates to the outside world and how other characters see him in this relating.
The functions will show you how your character is experiencing or taking in the information and circumstances of the plot as he faces them. They also help you make decisions on dialogue, clothing, mannerisms, style, and inner monologue, and thereby give you a solid framework from which to build well-rounded characters that are consistent. The functions offer another level to consider when using archetypes, though you can use them without archetypes if you want to.
Archetypes give you the deepest level of characterization, and these elements help you further focus and externalize archetypal qualities. In the best case, archetype comes first.
