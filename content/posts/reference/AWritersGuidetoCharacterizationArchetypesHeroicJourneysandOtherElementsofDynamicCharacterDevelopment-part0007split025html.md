A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MATRIARCH AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Matriarch and Maiden pairing is not a good one for the Maiden. The Matriarch will not put up with her free lifestyle. If the Maiden stays home, the Matriarch will make sure she stays plenty busy. Perhaps she is jealous of the Maiden’s free spirit and happy manner. The Matriarch has lost touch with her inner child, and she simply doesn’t know how to be a friend to the Maiden.
The Maiden can teach the Matriarch to loosen up, but the teaching will take a lot of effort and the results may not last long. It may be easier for the Maiden to hide out for a while to get a break from all the stress and pressure the Matriarch brings with her.
The Matriarch can teach the Maiden responsibility. However, she may aggravate the Maiden to the point that the Maiden feels unsupported and goes to work just to get away from the Matriarch.
