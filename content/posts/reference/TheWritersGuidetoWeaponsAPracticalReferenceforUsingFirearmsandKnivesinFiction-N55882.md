Tactics Used by Law Enforcement and the Military, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Tactics Used by Law Enforcement and the Military
It would take another book to cover all the points of police and military tactics. Here are a few key concepts for writing characters inside these organizations.
Send in the SWAT Team
Characters on a special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team are often written in during an intense standoff, raid, or other high-stakes encounter. In some communities and organizations, these are also called SRTs (special response teams).
Former law enforcement officer Lee Lofland writes about this subject extensively in his excellent book, Police Procedure & Investigation, published by Writer’s Digest Books. The following information originates in that title.
A SWAT entry team usually consists of six to ten officers, all packing tech, weapons, and well-timed one-liners (okay, that’s only in fiction). One officer takes out the door with a battering ram, then steps aside while the others file into the building.
A flash-bang grenade may be tossed into the building prior to their entry. The grenade uses noise and smoke to disorient occupants. The entry team then goes about the building to clear each room.
As the entry team piles in through the door, other SWAT team members simultaneously “rake and break.” This involves breaking in through other windows and doors. The rake-and-break crew orders anyone inside to hit the ground. The occupants are held at gunpoint until the entry team arrives and cuffs them.
Once the SWAT team gives the all clear, the investigation starts. Detectives and other officers gather evidence, make arrests, conduct interviews, etc.
SWAT Snipers
SWAT snipers typically use bolt-action rifles because of their reliability and accuracy. The models vary, so check the listings accompanying this guide. Most would use .223 caliber rifles or higher.
Lofland cites 860 yards (about a half mile) as the maximum range for SWAT snipers.
Traffic Stops
Many steps take place before an officer asks for the prototypical “license and registration, please” during a traffic stop. Before or after pulling a vehicle over, the officer:
tells dispatch the license plate number.
checks the vehicle and driver against the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.
calls in for backup, if necessary.
Before approaching the driver, the officer typically:
feels that the trunk is secure by placing a hand on it (to check for ambushes).
visually scans the interior of the vehicle.
Then the officer proceeds to speak with the driver. It may become necessary for the driver to step outside for the sake of the officer’s safety. The officer may also return to her car and run the driver’s license number for additional information.
Somewhere around this point in the process, fiction usually depicts a wanted character peeling off in the car. If you go this route, remember that having the officer fire shots in response doesn’t always make sense. In rural areas, it might be okay. But in urban or high-traffic settings? Consider collateral damage.
Stop and Frisk
An officer can initiate an on-the-spot pat down, or “stop and frisk,” if there’s reason to believe someone is carrying a weapon. This doesn’t require an arrest, but “officers must have facts to conduct a search, not merely a hunch, a gut feeling, or even a really good guess,” as Lofland writes.
This stop and frisk, Lofland continues, “must be quick, and the officer may only perform it to search for weapons. Any other items discovered during this brief search may not be used as evidence, since their seizure would be considered the fruit of an illegal search, even if those items were later determined to be key items of evidence in a major case. Even if officers found a key piece of evidence that solved a string of murders, it couldn’t be used.”
Puts a damper on most Law & Order episodes, doesn’t it?
Making an Arrest and the Use of Force
The use of force when making an arrest is supposed to be proportionate to the suspect’s level of compliance. Lower compliance equals greater force, and vice versa. “Police brutality” occurs when that balance is out of proportion in the eyes of the law (or, sometimes, the public eye).
Officers can use a variety of nonlethal, or less lethal, tools when applying force.
ASP expandable batons: More portable and concealable than the standard baton, these can collapse down to a few inches.
Beanbag projectiles: Ever been in a riot? These are what stung so much the next day. Beanbag projectiles are exactly what they sound like: cloth filled with BBs blasted from shotguns.
Electric police jacket: These jackets, typically sported during riots, shock anyone who touches them.
Freeze Plus P spray: “A combination of pepper spray and tear gas (orthochlorobenzalmalononitrile). This combination creates a synergistic effect, with each chemical magnifying the other. Freeze Plus P will penetrate wet or greased skin, as well as entering the body through inhalation,” Lofland says.
Noise- or sound-impulse devices: These devices blast irritating noises or music until a person submits to law enforcement. They might include speakers blaring Justin Bieber, although that might border on police brutality.
Pepper spray (oleoresin capsicum): The classic tearjerker.
Rubber bullets: These fall under the less lethal category, since they can cause death at close ranges.
Shock sticks: Also known as electric batons, these are the equivalent of a cattle prod for human hamburgers.
Stun belt: “[This is a] device placed around the waists of prisoners to prevent combative behavior. Officers carry a remote-control device that, when activated, delivers a debilitating electric shock to the prisoner. This device is often used on jail and prison inmates, or by police officers when transporting violent suspects,” says Lofland.
Two-handed batons: In an intense situation, when a standard baton just isn’t enough, officers might use a two-handed version roughly 36 inches in length.
A Crash Course in Military Tactics
Military tactics vary widely according to the branch of service, treaties, equipment, historical setting, and more. That can make writing military characters, especially those engaged in combat scenes, difficult.
The temptation, in stories set at the advent of the Tommy gun through today, is to let military characters open up with fully automatic firearms. The character spots a target, takes aim, and unloads, hosing the scene with leaden death nuggets. The more bullets flying through the air, the better chance of hitting the target character, right?
Well, sort of.
Remember that military characters, just like any other in a story, need to lug around all that ammunition. It gets heavy in a hurry. Given it takes mere seconds to empty a magazine in a full-auto, it’s probably premature to toss out that volume of ammo. A character could be up crap creek in a hurry. The quality of shots, not quantity, counts the most in combat.
That’s why modern military tactics, depending on the scenario, might use full-auto gunfire to force the target into a less favorable position or to take cover. Another shooter, likely with a rifle suited for precision, would make the actual kill shot.
Again, tactics vary, but statistics seem to back up this high shot-to-kill ratio. A July 2005 Government Accountability Office report, GAO-05-687, stated U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan required 1.79 billion small caliber and 21.5 million medium caliber rounds in fiscal year 2005 alone. An analysis by John Pike of www.GlobalSecurity.org, a military research group, estimated that 250,000 to 300,000 rounds were used per enemy combatant killed in those countries.
Those figures include training outside combat, but the point is still valid. It takes a target character’s weight in lead to kill him.
This makes for interesting trivia, but many writers will likely gloss over the shots that don’t make contact. That’s okay. Just be aware that militaries train for a reason.
