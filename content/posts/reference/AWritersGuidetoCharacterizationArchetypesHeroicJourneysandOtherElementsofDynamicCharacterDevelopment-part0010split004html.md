A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, something the Seductive Muse is very good at. She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks, which is the Businessman’s forte.
The Businessman has a hard time being around someone who is so in touch with his or her body—especially a woman.
He may feel like a shy, confused schoolboy when he’s around her, and he may not know what to do with her. Or he may have had such an intense day at work that he enjoys the sensual stimulation she provides. He wants to give his mind a rest, and she is just the person for the job. But can he see her as a potential wife? Will she support his career?
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the Businessman as stable and comfortable. She enjoys pushing his physical buttons and seeing him challenge himself physically. He’s so uncoordinated.
Or if he does not have the take-charge personality she craves, she may see him as a mere rube, someone she can manipulate and take advantage of.
