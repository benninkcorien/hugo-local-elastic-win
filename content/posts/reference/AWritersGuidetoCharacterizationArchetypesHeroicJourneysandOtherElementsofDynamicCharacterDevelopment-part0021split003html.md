A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
The heroine must accept who she is and in so doing she must accept that she’s vastly different from the people around her. This is a concept that may scare her. As long as she holds on to her resistance, she can maintain the illusion that she is just like everybody else and everything is fine and she can go on thinking that maybe she can get rid of this small part of her.
She doesn’t realize that if she would only incorporate her difference into her life, if she would simply accept it as a part of herself, then it would become a non-issue for her in the future. But she does not want to be different. She wants to fit in, to simply get along. She wants to be normal.
