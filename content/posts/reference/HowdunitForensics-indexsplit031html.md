Forensics: A Guide for Writers
AFTERWORD  
I hope your journey through this book was informative and fascinating. I hope you learned many new things and achieved a better understanding of what forensic science can and cannot do. I hope you more than once rummaged around on the Internet to explore more fully some topic that struck a chord or piqued an interest in you. Most importantly, I hope you had fun. I surely did while researching and writing.
Visit my Web site at www.dplylemd.com and you’ll find articles and questions from writers about all kinds of forensic topics. And if you feel so moved, drop me a note and let me know what you thought of Howdunit: Forensics. 
—D.P. Lyle, M.D.
