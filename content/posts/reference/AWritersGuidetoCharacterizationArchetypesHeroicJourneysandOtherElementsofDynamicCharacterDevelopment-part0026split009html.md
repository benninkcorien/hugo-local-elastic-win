A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
The audience’s interest in this is almost voyeuristic in the same way that we rubber neck to look at car crashes. It’s not that people enjoy seeing this kind of thing. They just can’t look away. There is something about the possibility of death or coming into contact with death that captivates us. The snake’s lesson is very much about that because the old self is actually dying and being replaced with something new.
