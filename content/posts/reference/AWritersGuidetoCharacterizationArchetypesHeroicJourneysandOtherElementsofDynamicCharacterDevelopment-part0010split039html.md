A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE NURTURER
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. Being the Caretaker that she is, the Nurturer can help him value himself, but she may not be able to help him become more responsible. She will take care of things for him so he doesn’t have many responsibilities.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and to find her own identity—things the Woman’s Man can help her with. He will drag her out, teach her how to have fun, and help her find what her own deep desires are. He will keep her caretaking side in check.
She understands his need to help women and will try to be understanding if he has a lot of female friends. He will understand her need to help others and will support her, unless this need takes over her life. He wants to see her enjoy her own life separate from being a caretaker.
He is very chivalrous and will bestow upon her some of the caretaking she bestows on others. This may make her uncomfortable at first, but it will do much to build her self-esteem.
