A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
A successful outcome occurs when the heroine recognizes her difference, accepts it, and allows herself to be a little different. Maybe she makes amends for being an addict by facing everyone she hurt. Maybe she pursues her talent for mixed martial arts fighting much to the chagrin of her mother and the other fighters. It doesn’t matter if she wins or loses, it only matters that she accepts herself.
