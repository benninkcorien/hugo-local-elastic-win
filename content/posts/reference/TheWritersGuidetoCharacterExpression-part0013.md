CHARACTERIZATION
CHARACTERIZATION
Quote: “...Voice is the “secret power” of great writing.” —Bestselling author, James Scott Bell
Using the methods outlined in this chapter will help writers create three-dimensional characters who will come alive within their complex fictional worlds by captivating their readers with deeper layers of characterization.
One of the critical elements to differentiate good writing from just average storytelling relates to how the writer handles the point-of-view. That’s why, I strongly feel that Deep POV is tightly connected to voice, which is a big part of characterization in my opinion.
In this chapter, I’ll try my best to explain “voice” in the terms that I understand them, and clarify how important it is to convey that through Deeper POV.
I consider the phrase “show, don’t tell” to primarily specify going deeper into a character’s POV. It isn’t just stating the facts or information, but giving the reader a glimpse of the world through the senses of the POV character. It allows the reader to become more immersed within the storyline and feel a stronger connection to the character(s).
A lot of manuscripts that I’ve edited over the years were lacking any “voice.” So it is my belief that some writers don’t fully comprehend what it means, or how it can deepen the characterization and give your writing a distinctive style.
So let me put it this way…just as everyone has their own characteristic way of speaking or expressing themselves, a writer’s characters should also have a distinctive “voice” that clearly comes across in the narrative.
I advise the writers that I work with to strengthen “voice” by using phrasing that reflects the overall tone of their book, along with the POV character’s unique personality. How the character reacts or responds in any given situation should be distinctive to their individuality. So choose your nouns and verbs carefully. Being specific about even small details like the weather, description of settings, or objects can create a stronger impression of that character’s POV.
These next two longer scenes were each taken from one of my novels, UNDER SUNLESS SKIES. The first one lacks any real emotional descriptions and has no “voice.” (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
I really hate my boring math class. I’m not listening to Mrs. Brooks talk about angles and measurements because I do not care. I will never use this type of math in the real world. I look up at the clock. There is fifteen minutes before the bell rings.
I feel bored and sleepy. I put my elbows on my desktop, and then I put my forehead into my hands and I close my eyes. Mrs. Brooks continues to talk about equations and her loud voice is irritating.
“If Miss Masterson paid attention in class,” Mrs. Brooks says, “I wouldn’t have to re-explain how the trigonometric ratios are derived from triangle similarity considerations today.”
I don’t glance up, because I don’t want to see her ugly face.
“Are you paying attention, Miss Masterson, or are you in a world of your own again?”
I hear several students laugh. I feel my cheeks heat with embarrassment.
I still do not look up at her unattractive features. “No, I’m not preoccupied,” I say sullenly.
“Then would you like to share with the class what you were doing that is more important than listening to my lecture?” Mrs. Brooks asks impatiently.
Now I feel enraged as I lift my head. My classmates laugh, and I hear them move in their seats as they turn to look at me.

The scene has been revised with Deep POV and it has “voice,” tension-soaked dialogue, introspection, and characterization. It is much longer and more detailed, but creates a much more vivid scene in the reader’s mind.
Please study this rewritten example…
DEEP POV:
Now I’m trapped sitting in class, not really listening to Mrs. Longwinded Brooks drone on about angles and measurements. I glare at the back of Hayden’s head, silently willing him to turn around and acknowledge me. It feels like I’m a minor character being faded out of a TV series, as if I’ve had one minute of total screen time with Hayden.
Clenching my jaw, every muscle in my body feels taut. I hate how he just blew me off. I hate that my parents aren’t trustworthy. I hate Zach and his fat-shaming slurs. I hate the mysterious person leaving threats in my locker. And I hate this uncomfortable metal desk with gum stuck to the side of it.
The seconds tick by. I glance at the clock hanging on the wall. Thirty-nine tortuous minutes before class ends. I want to be anywhere but here. I almost wish demons would attack the school and drag me to Hell, or worse…somewhere where there’s no chocolate. Now that would be pure evil!
Mrs. Brooks lectures on equations and her shrill voice sounds like braying sheep in heat. A sharp throbbing spreads across my forehead. I rest my elbows on the desk, then lower my head into my palms and close my eyes.
“If Miss Masterson would be more attentive…” Mrs. Brooks walks down the aisle, the rubber soles of her cheap pumps squeaking on the floor. “Then I wouldn’t have to waste everyone’s time by re-explaining how the trigonometric ratios derive from triangle similarity considerations.” Her footsteps pause at my desk.
I keep my head down, my eyes squeezed shut. If I lift my head and look at her, I’ll be compelled to stare at that mole on her chin. The one with the long, black witch hair sticking out of it.
“Are you paying attention, Miss Masterson?” She taps an impatient foot, then moves further along the aisle. “I do not tolerate sleeping in my classroom.”
Jeez. Adults think they’re so superior all the time. Just like my lying-deceiving parents.
“You do know that it’s not Halloween, right?” Emma says in a loud whisper, twisting in her seat. “You look like a wannabe vampire in that strange getup.”
The sarcastic edge in her voice grates on my last nerve.
With my head still cradled in my hands, I’m feeling the height of bitchiness coming on strong. So my style’s dark with a side of edgy? What’s the issue?
Slowly, I lift my head and shoot Emma a heated glare. “If you must know, it’s Halloween every day at my house.”
Emma’s pink mouth gapes, then snaps shut. Most of my classmates turn in their seats to watch the impending showdown. Several kids even stop scribbling in their notebooks. Hayden hangs his head and shakes it as if in disapproval.
“You call that style? More like chubby couture.” Emma snickers. “You must’ve read one too many Anne Rice novels. Unless you’re praying you’ll never come in contact with direct sunlight.”
My cheeks heat, my skin piping so hot it feels as if I’ve stuck my face in an oven.
Several students giggle. Hayden’s shoulders stiffen. Emma smiles and her best friend Kaitlyn rolls her squinty eyes.
I wonder if Emma is the blackmailer. Or maybe it’s her evil sidekick, Kaitlyn. Their combined Sloane-hate places them on my Do Not Trust list. I size Emma up. She’s wearing what might be the most preppy outfit I’ve ever seen outside an 80’s Brat Pack movie, a white button-up shirt under a pink cardigan and capris with plaid flats. She almost looks too innocent to be a suspect, but her bitchiness is singeing through her good girl persona.
“Emma, cut it out,” Hayden says under his breath.
Mrs. Brooks crosses both arms over her chest, obviously expecting me to apologize. “Are you quite done disrupting my class, Miss Masterson?”
Usually, I’m incapable of making people feel bad. Even if they’re in the process of mocking me. Not today.
“Yeah, can I go back to taking my nap now?” I yawn, then mumble, “As if I’ll ever use this stupid math anyway.”
“Get out of my classroom!” Mrs. Brooks points an index finger at the door. “Go to the principal’s office.”

Besides all the other key ingredients a writer needs to enhance a scene, “voice” is among the most vital to Deeper POV. Spend some time getting to know your characters. Fill out character interviews and profiles to gain some insight into their temperaments and personalities, and then let that shine through in your narrative by use of the Deep POV technique.
Each character’s voice personifies more than their speech or internal-thoughts. The narrative should express it as well. When you write a scene in a certain character’s POV, each sentence in that scene has to read as though it is being experienced, felt, and expressed by that character.
One easy way to add “voice” to any character is to incorporate a few personal quirks, or unique phrases, rather than impersonal or formal syntax. Strive to include words meaningful to the character’s personality and world views within the storyline.
