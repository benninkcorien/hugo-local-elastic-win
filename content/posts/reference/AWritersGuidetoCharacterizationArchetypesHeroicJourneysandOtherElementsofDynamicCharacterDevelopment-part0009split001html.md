A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE PROTECTOR
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
Although the Businessman and the Protector are opposing archetypes in many ways, they both are very independent and self-sufficient. They both need to be in control and take charge. The Businessman cares for the company and the Protector cares for people.
While the Protector lives in his body instead of his head, the Businessman lives in his head instead of his body. Career goals are not foremost in the Protector’s mind but they are very important to the Businessman.
The Protector can teach the Businessman about taking risks and cultivating some adventure in his life. He might say, “Push yourself to see how far you can go.” The Businessman can teach the Protector how to plan for the future, and thus avoid setbacks and complications.
