A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE NURTURER
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings. The Nurturer always considers what other people feel, so she can help him in this vein.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and to find her own identity—something the Fool can help her with. He is so unpredictable that she will find herself on her own many times when she least expects it. There’s not much for her to attach to and depend on with him. He’s his own person.
The Fool may exploit her need to help others, simply by knowing she will always take him back into her life when he’s down on his luck. She can’t help herself. This is bad for her if she still has feelings for him.
He can’t understand why she rearranges her entire life to help others. He admits that helping others is good but believes she needs to set boundaries for herself or she risks being of no use to anyone. He can teach her this.
She will be happy if his job has something to do with helping others, like working for the Peace Corps. This he may do as it allows him to move around a lot and meet new people. She may push his buttons if he’s materialistic and unsympathetic with others. He better be able to deal with her giving attention to others.
