Other Common Firearm Accessories and Their Uncommon Uses, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Other Common Firearm Accessories and Their Uncommon Uses
Most of what writers require from firearms is summed up in their operation. Thank goodness for that, because there are a million different ways firearms can be modified and accessorized. But every now and then, a scene calls for a certain accessory. Here’s a roundup of some common ones and their not-so-common uses.
Bayonets
Historically bayonets cornered the market on close-quarter brawls. That was the case up until World War II, when bayonets became shorter, resembling knives more than swords. That allowed them to mesh better with firearm designs used during the war, which favored mobility over the longer rifles of World War I and prior conflicts.
Decreasing the size from a small sword to a long knife also increased bayonets’ utility outside of combat. A trusty bayonet can serve scores of purposes, from cutting rope and opening meal tins to prying open boxes and pounding stakes.
Consider that divide in bayonet history when determining their use in a story. World War I marked the last of the large-scale bayonet charges, usually as the enemy retreated. By World War II, they were all but gone.
Military personnel from WWII and beyond either skipped bayonets entirely in favor of proper knives or used knives that doubled as bayonets. Although bayonets played a significant role during hand-to-hand combat in the Falklands War in the 1980s, modern military firearms hardly account for their presence anymore. Some modern firearm features, such as grenade launchers, can’t be used if a bayonet is present.
Does that mean there isn’t a role for a bayonet in a modern setting? Of course not. You can do a lot more with them than stab a character outright. Writers might consider these other purposes:
for corralling or detaining other characters (sort of like a cattle prod)
as a deterrent against someone grabbing the firearm
as a spare knife for use as a tool
for intimidation purposes
for roasting marshmallows in a pinch (hey, sometimes a character just needs a s’more)
It’s sometimes said a bayonet can affect the trajectory of a shot. This might be true in some cases, since it can alter the balance of a firearm, but it’s probably not enough to concern a fiction writer.
And don’t forget: Bayonets aren’t just for rifles. They work well attached to shotguns and handguns, too. Get creative.
Bipods and Tripods
Bipods consist of a pair of folding or stationary supports used for stability, usually affixed to the barrel. This helps with accuracy, most often when shooting rifles (they can be paired with any type of firearm).
Tripods are used for heavier firearms, such as large machine guns, and are mounted closer to the middle of the firearm.
Other than offering stability, bipods and tripods also indicate the character is likely familiar with operating a firearm. This can be useful for quickly establishing character.
Camouflage
There are two effective ways to camouflage a firearm: You can paint it, or you can use tape.
Paint is permanent, so it would follow that the environment of the scene never changes.
Tape is temporary and can be changed when conditions—such as the climate or seasons—change.
Either way, remember that camo isn’t for concealment alone. It’s also for establishing character. Someone who camouflages his weapon probably knows how to take care of business with a firearm.
Collapsible Stocks
Collapsible stocks fold or slide to lengthen or shorten the firearm. In the real world, they’re a feature for the comfort of the shooter. In fiction, they’re usually there for looks. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Collapsible stocks gained a lot of attention in the federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) when they were banned on new civilian firearms made between 1994 and 2004. Collapsible stocks adjust to shorten or lengthen the part of the firearm shooters hold against their shoulder when they fire. They can fold (called a folding stock) or push inward. The latter is most popular since it allows for a custom fit on the shooter. In fiction, collapsible stocks are most often depicted as a sniper is setting up a rifle (think the shooter on the rooftop opening a briefcase of gun parts and assembling the weapon). There’s no reason to avoid that, since it seems fiction is mostly interested in these stocks for looks. A character might also use collapsible stocks to conceal a long firearm under clothing or in a hiding place. Law enforcement characters, especially SWAT members, might find that shortening their stocks make it more convenient to get in and out of vehicles.
In reality, using a collapsible stock is primarily a comfort thing. Just don’t include one in a story on a firearm made between 1994 and 2004.
Flashlights
Flashlights, either mounted onto a firearm or held separately in tandem with a handgun, are useful for illuminating a dark scene. No surprises there, but writers should keep in mind another use: disorienting other characters.
Blinding someone with light is a control technique used by law enforcement. As Scott Wagner points out in his excellent book Own the Night: Selection & Use of Tactical Lights & Laser Sights, there’s even a snappy saying for that tactic: illuminate, identify, and incapacitate.
Heavy flashlights carried separately also make great melee weapons.
Grenade Launchers
Modern grenade launchers (tubes that fire explosive projectiles) are usually mounted below a firearm’s barrel. This is most common with rifles well suited to customization, such as the U.S. military’s M16 or its civilian equivalent, the AR-15.
While grenade launchers are perfect for turning legs into stumps or disabling vehicles with explosive power, they’re much more versatile than that.
Flares, buckshot, tear gas, smoke bombs, and even less-lethal crowd control sponges all can be fired from grenade launchers. The legality of grenade launchers depends on the state in which they’re being used and what’s being fired. The launcher itself is usually easier to obtain legally than the ammunition it uses.
Grenade launchers dating back to World War I slipped into the end of a rifle barrel. The blast from a blank cartridge set off the grenade. However, the shooter could not quickly shift to firing regular rifle ammunition, so this setup was deemed ineffective. Following World War II, grenade launchers mounted beneath the barrel gained in popularity.
No matter the style, grenade launchers can be a lot of fun to write.
Hollow Stocks
Rifles and shotgun stocks (the part the shooter presses against his or her shoulder) are often solid, but some have hollow butts (insert juvenile joke here). This means that the end of the stock is empty inside. A character with some time and motivation could use it for the storage of small items.
Need some perspective? Creek Stewart, a survival instructor I worked with at Living Ready magazine, managed to pack an entire emergency kit into a hollow stock. Some rifles, such as the .22 caliber AR-7, can be completely taken apart and stored inside the stock. On top of that, the AR-7’s lone stock can float in water.
Hollow stocks are ripe for fiction. It’s a wonder they don’t show up more often.
Pistol Grips

Some rifles and shotguns allow for pistol grips instead of the standard stock. This means the shooter’s trigger-pulling hand grips a handle fashioned like the ones used on pistols. That doesn’t mean the shooter would hold the rifle or shotgun with one hand like a pistol. It’s just a design element.
In fiction, I get the feeling pistol grips are mentioned as a way for a character to show off or look tough, likely influenced by other pop-culture depictions. Is there any practical benefit to them in reality? The jury is out.
Some say pistol grips are more ergonomic and make shooting at closer ranges easier. Others say they increase the shooter’s maneuverability.
Here’s my take: Pistol grips are for looks or comfort but don’t necessarily add anything to performance.
As far as uncommon uses go, pistol grips are sometimes hollow. That means a clever character could store important items inside.
Slings
The primary purpose of a sling is to strap a rifle or shotgun to the shooter. The uses don’t stop there, though. Any unorthodox ideas writers can come up with for a short length of rope can be applied to a sling.
Small pouches of important items, spare ammo, and even a knife sheath could be secured along the sling.
Slings are also useful for increasing accuracy. Threading a hand in and around them stabilizes the arm.
Out of ammo? A character could also use the sling to strangle the opposition.
Spare Ammunition for Shotguns
If a character’s shotgun just won’t cut it in the capacity department, she can carry extra ammunition in several ways without stuffing shells into her pockets.
One of the most popular is an extended magazine (the tube under the barrel where the shells are held in reserve). Law enforcement and military agencies often use these extra-long magazines. State laws may dictate how many shells civilians can have in a shotgun. For example, I insert a wooden rod into the magazine of my pump-action shotgun when hunting regulations limit the total number of shells I can have in the firearm at one time. This homemade plug restricts the amount of ammunition that can be loaded into the magazine.
Saddles are another common choice. These plastic clips usually hold three to five shells, secured to the stock.
A shell caddy, basically a small box secured to a belt, can contain up to eight or more shells.
Similar to saddles are elastic shell holders. These bands slip onto shotgun stocks and hold three to five shells. They don’t last as long as saddles because they tend to wear out.
Now for some uncommon uses: Spare ammunition offers a chance to swap in different ammunition types. A character might load shotshells (they fire BBs) into the magazine, then stick slugs (they fire a single, solid projectile) into a saddle. Or he might alternate shells as he loads them: for example, shotshell-slug-shotshell-slug. The same could be done for flare rounds (used for signaling help), less-lethal beanbag loads (they fire bean bags instead of BBs or slugs, but not the fun kind you had as a kid), and other variants.
A character might carry these different types of ammo to react to changing situations. This can give the writer more flexibility, too.
Spare Ammunition for Rifles and Pistols
Generous magazines aren’t just for shotguns. Rifles and pistols with detachable magazines can enjoy their benefits, too. Using bigger magazines, those firearms can up their capacity to 20, 30, 50, 100, or more.
Rifles with magazines built inside them are out of luck in this department unless they use tubes to hold ammunition similar to a shotgun. This feature is often used in pump-action and lever-action rifles. Then it would be acceptable to write in an extended tube magazine, although most models are already maxed out without this addition.
Rifles can also use elastic bands that hold shells and slip onto the stock. These bands aren’t as popular for lighter rifles, such as the .17 and .22, because their shells are so small.
There’s not much room for uncommon uses with these accessories. Maybe writers out there will come up with some others.
Spare Ammunition for Revolvers
Sorry, characters with revolvers, but there’s not much you can do about ammunition capacity. A character might carry speed loaders, speed strips, and moon clips—explained in the section on handgun ammunition—separately to avoid manually reloading.
