A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. She can help him with these things, but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people to change.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. The Artist is not skilled in these arenas. He doesn’t care all that much about planning things out, but he’s not a very trusting person either.
He can be an asset if he’s willing to use his creative energy to help her. Otherwise, if he refuses to take her seriously or believe in her, he can be a drawback. He can cause her to doubt herself and her task.
She has a hard time understanding his projects and his ‘selfishness,’ as she sees it. She says things like: “What can one painting do for the world? Why is he always so moody? You’re supposed to master your feelings, not be mastered by them.”
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. That’s okay for the Artist because as long as he can be himself and find time for his interests he likes a change of scenery once in a while. He wants a woman who will support and understand him, not try to change him.
