A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR CHARACTER RESIST THIS LESSON?
A character might resist this lesson because although people feel instinctively with their guts, they are taught to value only what can be seen and heard directly. Protecting oneself via what one sees and hears usually does not turn out well, but time and again we are taught to value facts over intuition.
As we grow up, we give up our innocence and generosity, and become hardened. We often live in fear and look out for who might hurt us or attack us. In this way, we live outside of the present moment. We think that somehow living this way is smarter than dealing with the present and that it will somehow protect us. Everyone around us supports this idea.
People may also resist the idea of trying to retain their innocence. They feel that being childlike is childish, though there is a big difference between the two.
