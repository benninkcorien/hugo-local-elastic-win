A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Supporting characters would encourage her to see the value of what she has. A lot of them probably have tried to make her see, but only a harsh wake-up call will do the trick. She needs to learn how to count her blessings, to put things in perspective, to understand that her view of life as cynical and pessimistic is skewed and a symptom of not caring for and respecting herself.
She may not take very good care of herself at all. She may be smoking too much and develop emphysema. Her house may be a mess. She may be running, running, running like the George Clooney character who constantly travels in the movie Up in the Air.
