A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
Life can be painful and you may want to portray your characters as beaten down. You can show this through symbols, setting, and costuming. A trickster or shape-shifter character works well here. Shape-shifters have always been associated with the coyote’s Murphy’s Law ways of wreaking a zany form of havoc in people’s lives to teach them lessons.
The effects of this kind of transformational arc could be present in the setting. Think lots of color versus bland beiges. The character might change her way of dress, from a pared-down, simple style into more flowery, colorful, vibrant outfits. Perhaps those around her wonder “What’s changed about her?” They recognize a difference. The way the characters react to her might be comical, prompting the heroine to think, “Oh my god, all I did was change my shirt, people, calm down!” Indications can even occur in the dialogue. All of a sudden, the hero is using words she never used before: “Well, I have been broadening my vocabulary,” she says.
You can also be innovative and resourceful in a different way that isn’t about laughter and comedy but is more about taking risks. In more serious films, you can have the hero take risks that get more and more crazy.
