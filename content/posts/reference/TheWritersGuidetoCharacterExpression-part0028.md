SHALLOW: CURIOSITY
SHALLOW: CURIOSITY
Quote: “If, however, you want to write a character from the ground up, a character who is as real as any person living, yet wholly your own creation, then there are three aspects you need to know in depth: the physical, sociological and psychological.”—Moody Writing blog, mooderino
A curious character is one that might be super nosey or just naturally inquisitive. This type of character can constantly question other character’s motives and inquire about certain situations. But it could also lead to them sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong and causing wonderfully delicious conflict within the storyline. It is this overwhelming desire to investigate and explore that can motivate a character to solve a crime or uncover a mystery.
Having your character wonder about things is a great way to explore their thoughts and feelings within the storyline.
Curiosity can be a positive character trait or a negative one, depending on the storyline. An inquisitive character might be more adventurous and unafraid to venture into dangerous situations. For instance, a detective who’s instinctively curious will catch the bad-guy, and an inquisitive teenage girl will figure out who stole the school mascot. And possibly, one of the most recognized character tropes is the nosy neighbor, which I think can be a fun personality to include in any type of genre.
Curiosity can also be associated with wondering, speculating, questioning, snooping, or prying.
Signs of curiosity might be:
Head tilting to the side
Raised eyebrows
Eyes big and round
Slowly nodding
Gesturing with hand for someone to continue speaking
Eyebrows creasing
Staring intently
Eavesdropping
Increased awareness of sensory information
Fidgeting or restless
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I was curious what Ed and Mary were discussing in the next room.
DEEP POV: I crept closer to wall and pressed my ear against the wood. I had to know if Ed and Mary were talking about me.
SHALLOW: Tom was an inquisitive person.
DEEP POV: When I caught Tom rifling through my trash can to see what type of wine I drank, I knew it was time to move.
SHALLOW: Mandy was an odd and nosey person.
DEEP POV: Mandy asked a million questions while peeking into my dresser drawers.
SHALLOW: His constant prying had become annoying.
DEEP POV: Whenever anyone stopped by my house, my nosey neighbor would show up and casually ask me who had just left.
SHALLOW: He was curious about the monkey
DEEP POV: His gaze tracked the monkey swinging from the trees, waiting to see what he would do next.
SHALLOW: Her curiosity was an intricate part of her exasperating personality.
DEEP POV: Even as a child, Alice was always peeking into closets and rummaging through boxes in the attic.
SHALLOW: She was curious what he was thinking about.
DEEP POV: His stoic expression left no hint as to what he was thinking.
SHALLOW: I was curious about Melvin’s whereabouts.
DEEP POV: I had no idea what Melvin was up to, but I was going to find out!

Here are two longer scenes illustrating how writers can avoid shallow writing and apply a Deeper POV. (In the first example, I underlined the shallower writing and any overwriting that is not needed.)
Please carefully examine these examples…
SHALLOW:
Harper did not know why her friend had suddenly returned.
“Do you know why Ella is back?” Aiden asked Harper inquiringly.
Why had my former best friend, Ella returned after inexplicably disappearing twelve months ago? Harper wondered with curiosity.
“Maybe she was abducted by aliens,” Aiden mused out loud.
Harper ignored Aiden’s absurd speculations. Ella was too pretty and amiable to ever join a cult or kill anyone, Harper thought. Harper even had to do all the dissecting in high school Biology because Ella couldn’t bring herself to hurt the poor frog. But she was dying of curiosity (cliché), and it was fun to speculate.
“Harper, do you have any idea why Ella came back to town or not?” Aiden asked Harper again in a questioning tone. “Please tell me about your theories because I’m very curious.”
Harper stared at him with a curious expression, and felt her face blushing hotly. The truth was, she hadn’t spoken to Ella in over a year. Maybe Ella really had turned into a brainwashed cult leader or spent the last year in a penitentiary, Ella thought to herself.
“I have no idea,” she said softly, and then added inquisitively, “But I’m curious to find out…”
The next version has been rewritten with more “voice,” Deep POV, and more characterization.
DEEP POV:
“Hey, Harper, any idea why Ella suddenly came back to town?” Aiden wiggled his eyebrows. “Maybe she’s been in jail for something like murder!”
She shook her head. Ella, her former best friend, had returned after mysteriously skipping town a year ago. Ella was too smart to ever join a cult or murder anyone. Harper smiled, remembering how she’d even done all the slicing and dicing in Biology because Ella couldn’t bring herself to dissect the stupid frog.
Tilting her head, Harper tapped a finger on her chin. “I haven’t got a damn clue.”
“But it’s weird, right?” Aiden scratched his curly head. “You must have a theory.”
Harper blinked, and her oval face flushed hotly. For all she knew, Ella really had turned into a brainwashed cult leader or been locked up in some woman’s insane asylum.
“Yeah, it is strange,” she said, rubbing her chin. “But don’t worry, I’ll find out…”

By giving your characters realistic emotions and reactions, it gives them even more complexity. And being able to describe those emotions through Deeper POV adds mastery to your writing.
