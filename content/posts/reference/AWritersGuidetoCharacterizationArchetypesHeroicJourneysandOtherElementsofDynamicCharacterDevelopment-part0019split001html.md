A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE FOX’S CHARACTER ARC
The hero finds himself in a situation where the outcome is pretty certain. The reader thinks she knows what’s going to happen—there isn’t much hope for the hero—but then the hero does something completely unexpected and turns everything around.
This kind of thing takes a lot of belief in yourself. Having some experience with doing things differently, so that you know it can be done, helps. A good example is Steve Jobs and his Think Different campaign for the Apple computer. The campaign appealed to a lot of people who wanted to be different and to think differently and to approach challenges in a different way. It’s not necessarily about being a genius. It’s about being clever and having a creative mind-set. Put simply, it’s looking at a situation and finding a completely different way to deal with it.
It could be a case of health. If the doctor says, “I’m sorry, but you have six months left to live and there really isn’t anything else that can be done,” then it’s about looking outside the box and saying, “Well, I don’t accept that. There must be something I can try.” Perhaps you will go on a journey to try to heal another way. It’s about finding inventive ideas and ways to solve your problem, whatever the problem is.
For example, my dad was a carpenter who did a lot of work on people’s houses.
When the tools he had didn’t fit together to get a job done, he would take a moment and go deep into his thoughts. He would find a creative solution to the problem by combining things no one ever thought to combine. And in that way he would get the job done on schedule.
Another example of this occurred with the recent oil spill in the Gulf. For several weeks, oil continued to gush deep under the water, and no one could figure out how to stop it. A simple plumber submitted some schematics online, showing how to create a fix that ended up solving the problem. That was inventive. However, the guy who said, Let’s put up a website so regular people can submit ideas, because we’re running out of them, was equally inventive.
When danger from a predator is involved, the fox is able to camouflage and hide very well. So this lesson also illustrates the element of cleverness in hiding. In a horror movie, for instance, the hero will use his clever thinking to hide from a crazy killer. In this way, he protects himself.
