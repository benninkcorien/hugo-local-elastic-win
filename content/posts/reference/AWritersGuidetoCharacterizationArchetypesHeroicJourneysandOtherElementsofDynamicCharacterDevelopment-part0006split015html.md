As you can see, the functions help further define the archetypes. You now know, for example, that an Amazon consults her feelings as well as her intuition when she makes a decision. So when she needs to take action, she will go with her gut regardless of what others think.

On the other hand a Maiden will use her senses to make decisions. When picking a restaurant for her next meal, she will taste the food in her mind first. When deciding larger issues, she will listen to what others have to say before forming her own impressions and opinions.
“Why can’t she just make a decision like everyone else?” Daphne said to the salesman as she stared at Vanessa.
Vanessa didn’t pay her any mind, she wanted to pick the best couch she could find. After all, she’ll be living with it every day. Especially now that she works at home.
“This one is nice but, well, the cushions are a bit lumpy. That one’s okay but the color is … too … bright. It just doesn’t do it for me. Maybe I’ll come back next week and see what you have then.”
Waving her hands in the air, Daphne stormed out of the store.
