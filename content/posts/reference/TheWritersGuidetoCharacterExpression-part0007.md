SHOW DON’T TELL
SHOW DON’T TELL
Quote: “Every creative writing student has heard the rule that you should show, not tell, but this principle seems to be among the hardest for beginners to master.” —author, Robert Sawyer
First let me say this…I get it. I really do. Your book is like your baby, and you love it and you’ve poured your sweat and blood and tears into it. But sometimes writers need a take a step back and look at the writing from a reader’s perspective…
I’ve found that a lot of novice writers that I’ve worked with get confused by the whole “show vs. tell” concept, and I admit that it used to confuse me, too.
A few months ago, one of my critique partners said that she thought writers could only use the Deep POV technique about fifty percent of the time. I disagree. I think it can be used anytime a writer wants to avoid naming the emotion or they use sensory details to describe a scene. And describing a character’s body language, facial expression, actions, gestures, or tones of voice are just some of the many ways that writers can show.
Most of the time when writers do not apply Deeper POV, it creates narrative distance. This means that the reader has been distanced, or in some cases, jolted out of the story by author intrusion. The more telling a writer does, the more distance they put between the reader and the story, and the less involved the reader will feel to what’s happening or a real connection to the characters.
And if readers aren’t connecting to your characters, then you’ve got a major problem.
The number one reason that showing is more visual and appealing for the reader is that fiction is image focused, and showing usually generates a much more vivid image for the reader, rather than stating facts. Generally, telling doesn’t produce a strong enough picture in the reader’s mind, and it often causes author intrusion, which reminds readers that they are reading a story—and that’s not something a writer ever wants.
Please study this example, where the sentence is telling…
SHALLOW: Caleb felt hot in his wool coat.
That sentence isn’t an image the reader can effortlessly imagine.  It’s an ambiguous fact. 
DEEP POV: Caleb swiped a bead of sweat from his forehead and shrugged off his heavy winter coat.
The revised sentence puts a very powerful illustration in the reader’s mind. 
If you read a ton of fiction like me, you’ll notice telling in almost every published novel, some more than others, but that doesn’t mean you should “tell” if you can show. I realize that some telling is mandatory in narrative, but not when you are describing the character’s emotions or internal-thoughts. Those should always be shown by using the Deep POV technique.
Fiction is a creative art, and writers need to use descriptions and senses, and not simply state emotions or continuously give direct facts.
Please look at one example below…
SHALLOW: Jane was a beautiful young girl.
That sentence is a form of telling, and although the sentence states a fact, it gives a rather weak visual.
DEEP POV: Jane swept into the room and her delicate lilac perfume wafted in the air, tickling my nose. When she spotted me sitting alone, her pouty, pink lips lifted into an amazing smile that lit up her azure eyes. A thick mane of ebony waves fell over one shoulder, and to me she resembled a painting of a Greek goddess brought to life. For a moment, it felt like my heart stopped beating in my chest.
Now ask yourself: which description was more powerful and visual?
Now, I’m not suggesting that a writer show or describe everything in great detail because that would be overwriting and create pacing issues. The key is to understand the difference so writers can intelligently decide when to use Deep POV and when to just tell. Finding a balance is necessary.
Here are four easy to master tips on writing in Deep POV and red flags:
1) Writers should try to reduce as many filtering references as they can from their writing. Words such as felt, saw, heard, smelled, and noticed, etc. that tell the reader what the narrator felt or saw or heard or noticed instead of just stating it.
Always strive to find new and active ways to describe a character’s emotional state, or allow your characters to convey their emotions through action, facial expressions, internal-dialogue, and body language.
2) Naming the emotion can become a bad habit that writers easily fall into. Writers create narrative distance and author intrusion when they deliberately or unintentionally insert shallower POV and telling sentences into their scenes.
Anything that directly states the narrator’s thought, emotion, or mode of perception is considered telling the reader about whatever the character is experiencing.
Writers should have more respect for their readers by showing instead.
3) Be more specific when describing places, settings, people, clothing, objects, cars, etc. so you don’t create a weak visual. The easiest way to stay in Deeper POV is to try to be much more specific whenever possible by including sensory details.
By writing with precise and detailed words, and avoiding vagueness, writers will remove most of the “tells” from a story and breathe new life into any scene.
4) One way to rid your fiction of shallow writing is to use the “look through the camera lens” method, which is an excellent tool for helping writers begin to notice any telling within a manuscript.
Imagine this: the character is standing behind the camera, and everything in the scene, is perceived through that POV character’s eyes and then reported through their perspective.
But the camera can’t view any of the five senses, like sounds, touch (the way something feels), smells, temperatures, or tastes. In addition, interior-dialogue—the character’s internal thoughts and emotions—cannot be viewed by a camera, and so it is not (usually) considered telling.
***
There are times when telling will add to the rhythm of your sentence and it is simply necessary. Telling shouldn’t be completely removed from your manuscript because that would be impossible and some of your prose could become particularly awkward.
Do I use filtering word/references on occasion?
Yes, because I mostly write in first-person POV and sometimes they are hard to avoid without creating awkward sentences. However, my advice is this: if you can rewrite the sentence without it and stay in Deeper POV, then do it. If some of the time you cannot, then go ahead and leave the shallow word in the sentence.
