A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHO SAID ROMANCE HAS TO BE BORING?
By analyzing the top three fairy tales—Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Sleeping Beauty—you will see firsthand how to plot the romantic journey or subtext of your story. Fairy tales are universal, just as archetypes are. These stories are found in different variations across many cultures.
Very often in real life, love and power are intertwined. When you love someone, you are left vulnerable to the object of your desire. Likewise, when someone else loves you, you are placed in the more powerful position.
In the three fairy tales that follow you will find three variations of how love and power manifest themselves in relationships. The suggested archetypes are not meant to be the rule, they are simply the archetypes that fit most easily into each romantic subplot. Mixing archetypes a bit may make it more interesting.
