CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS
CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS
Quote: “The characters in our stories, songs, poems, and essays embody our writing. They are our words made flesh. Sometimes they even speak for us, carrying much of the burden of plot, theme, mood, idea, and emotion. But they do not exist until we describe them on the page. Until we anchor them with words, they drift, bodiless and ethereal. They weigh nothing; they have no voice.”—excerpt from “Word Painting” by Rebecca McClanahan 
This chapter focuses on ways that writers can describe a character’s physical appearance though Deep POV. (Some of these topics are also covered in my handbook, “Craft Vivid Scenes and Dynamic Characters,” but I have expanded some of that information in this guide.)
Character descriptions can be tough to write and so many writers neglect to add physical descriptions to the narrative. When we describe a character’s physical appearance, sometimes precise facts about their features, or height and weight, are not quite visual enough.
How you ever read a book and visualized the main character as a lanky, brown-haired nerd, only to discover fifty pages into the story that the character was a brawny, tan, blond guy?
And if writers use clichéd, colorless descriptions they can be too generic, and they don’t really help the reader get a clear image of the characters. Writers should describe the characters as early as possible in a manuscript, but avoid creating a boring list of attributes by using weaker descriptive words. Now, I know some of you will argue that other published writers do this, but most professional editors will consider this to be lazy writing. So avoid using descriptors that simply label a character, short, fat, young, old, or ordinary, which do not create a clear image.
Readers need vibrant images and physical details to envision fictional characters. So I suggest thoughtfully selecting only those descriptors that evoke the clearest, most revealing impressions. Also, writers should allow their descriptions to multitask to also reveal (show rather than tell) more about a character’s personality and background.
Please take a look at these examples…
SHALLOW:
John was slender and he had very long legs. He had messy brown colored hair. John’s lips looked really thin. He usually wore baggy clothes and a baseball cap. He hated to go to work meetings. His boss gave him a dirty look when he yawned at one of the meetings.
DEEP POV:
Man, I hate these boring sale’s meetings.
John stretched his long legs under the table and loudly yawned.
When the boss paused in his speech and glared at him, John immediately straightened in his seat and tugged at the drooping waistband of his pants.
Once the meeting concluded, he darted back to his desk. John slouched in his chair, running his slender fingers through his tousled brown hair, and then flipping a baseball cap backwards on his head. He caught sight of his reflection in the laptop monitor and wiped a smudge of mustard from the corner of his thin lips.

A clever writer applying the Deep POV method can learn to skillfully tuck the physical characteristics into the narrative by lacing it through action and dialogue. Writers need to make all characters as three-dimensional as possible, so that the reader sees them as real people.
If writers can describe what the character(s) look like, how they feel, and how they react to situations and events unfolding around them, it will make the writing much more powerful.
The best technique is to present just enough relevant details to help your reader instantly “see” the character without doing an info-dump, because the right blend of description, dialogue, and introspection, along with some action can create a stronger image for the reader.
Telling descriptions create weak illustrations that can leave the reader grappling for a visual and feeling disconnected from the characters and the scene.
I have included some examples on how to describe physical characteristics to show you what I mean.
Please take a look at these examples…
SHALLOW:
Cole wore tan pants, and leaned against a car. He had blond hair and blue eyes. His full lips grinned at me. I really liked him.
DEEP POV:
Cole stuffed his hands into the pockets of his wrinkled khakis, reclining his large frame against a shiny black Mustang. The breeze ruffled his blond hair, and I yearned to brush the gold strands out of his cerulean eyes. When those generous lips tipped into an arrogant grin, I knew my heart was in big trouble.

These next two scenes are longer, and the first is a bland example with intrusive dialogue tags and wordy sentences. (In the shallow example, I did not underline all the obvious areas of shallower writing, but see if you can easily spot it now that you’re more aware of showing vs. telling.)
Please study and compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
Tad noticed a tall woman in a skirt with bare legs and high-heels enter through the front doors of the building. She had green eyes. He saw that the woman was clutching the handle of a purse very tightly as she examined the lobby. He watched her lick her lips, and then she frowned. She had medium-length blond hair. He noticed that she was wearing an ivory shirt, and there was some blood on the sleeve. He watched as her eyes looked back at the parking lot.
Then she saw the security desk and she walked across the floor toward Tad. He felt nervous, so he sat up before she made it to the desk.
“May I help you, miss?” he asked politely.
She placed her hand on the top of the desktop. He looked down and he saw that she had long red fingernails. Her eyes looked into his, and Tad felt very nervous.
“Can you please tell me what floor I can find Stanley Martin’s office?” she asked coldly.
This second scene has been rewritten with “voice” and sensory details.
DEEP POV:
A tall woman wearing a striped skirt, with the longest, smoothest legs, Tad had ever seen entered the building. Her icy blue gaze searched the lobby, her hands clutching the handle of her Fendi purse. She licked her red lips, the corners of her mouth tipping downward. She half turned, staring at the parking lot through the sliding glass doors, before muttering a curse. When she pivoted back around, her silk blouse became partially untucked.
Spotting the security desk, she glided forward, her flaxen hair styled in a feathery bob that bounced off her slim shoulders. Her stilettos clacking against the marble floor echoed like a shotgun going off in the quiet room.
Tad sat up, quickly adjusting his wrinkled uniform and straightening his tie. A waft of her exotic perfume reached Tad before she did.
Damn, she’s even sexier up close.
He gave her a toothy grin. “May I help you, miss?”
She studied him for a long second, one long ruby fingernail tapping the polished surface of the desktop. A splatter of blood stained her ivory cuff.
“Can you please tell me what floor I can find Stanley Martin’s office?” Her voice was low and cold. The woman withdrew a 38. Special from her purse and pointed the gun at him. “And don’t make me use this.”

These three excerpts were taken from my novel, IMMORTAL ECLIPSE. They both illustrate how writers can describe a character through Deeper POV and “voice” and emotional reactions.
Please closely examine this example…
DEEP POV:
I blink several times at the dark-haired man standing in the doorway, trying not to stare at his eyes, an intense shade of blue. Damn, he was better looking than most male fashion models I’ve photographed. Mr. Tall, Dark, and Yummy tilts his head as his eyes lock on mine. Even from a distance, I can tell he’ll tower over me, and I’m no midget. He’s even dressed similar to the man in the portrait: a soft, white linen shirt—bulging biceps stretching the fabric—under a black vest paired with snug pants and chunky boots. Although, he appears to be only in his late twenties, he looks reserved and intimidating.
Conclusion: no sense of style, but still smoking hot.
Please closely examine this next example…
DEEP POV:
Compared to the décor in Pauletta’s posh office, the furniture is frayed and outdated, with a stack of law books dusting the desk. The room overlooks the Bay Bridge and smells of day-old cigar. Yuck.
Matthew Rosenberg glances up, surprising me with how much he’s aged. His wrinkled skin—probably from all those afternoons spent negotiating cases on the golf course—with teeth that flash yellow when he smiles, and pants drooping beneath a gut that strains his shirt buttons. The years spent in California have added bloat and wrinkles that accentuate his every flaw.
Please closely examine this third example…
DEEP POV:
Behind her glass-top desk, Pauletta sits in a sleek black leather chair, which reclines to an almost obscene angle as she crosses her smooth brown legs. She’s wearing a silk Hermès scarf draped over a gray blouse, a matching rayon skirt, and really cute pair of Bettye Muller heels.

Now describing a first-person narrator is a bit trickier, but not impossible if you have the tools and know how.
This next passage was taken from MOONLIGHT MAYHEM in my young adult series, and it should give you a pretty good idea on how to describe a first-person narrator.
Please closely examine this example…
DEEP POV:
I flicked my gaze to Ariana. She stared out the window, her expression pensive. I reached over and gave her hand a squeeze. Glimpsing my skin next to hers reminded me that Ariana and I were total opposites, like sunny skies versus somber clouds. An optimist compared to a pessimist. And not only in personality, but in looks, too. She had blond ringlets, winter pale skin that had a sparkly glow in direct sunlight, and a curvaceous figure.
Me? Well, I’d inherited unusual looking features due to my Sioux lineage on my father’s side: an athletic body, high cheekbones, olive complexion, bronze eyes, and thick hair the color of midnight. Yup, she was light to my dark. Even in how we viewed the world.
These next two excerpts were also taken from my novel, MOONLIGHT MAYHEM, to give writers an idea on how to describe a character’s hair.
Please carefully examine these two examples…
DEEP POV:
My ex stood at the counter with his friend and ordered a pizza. His hair tapered in the back and across both sides, but left heavy on top was styled into a spiky mess.
DEEP POV:
Every time I caught sight of my reflection and my unevenly cut, shoulder-length black hair, it reminded me of the wickedness that my crazed mother was capable of doing. Last month, she’d hacked off my long, straight hair in an attempt to break me. It hadn’t worked. She’d done other things—awful things—which I would never understand. Chopping off my hair had only been one of them. And I hated how it looked now. Taking the scissors, I trimmed the ends so they looked more even and rested on my shoulders. Much better.

Here are a few more examples of shallow sentences that “tell” the reader the physical characteristics instead of showing. I realize that using Deep POV in descriptions can make the prose wordy, and just telling the reader might be a quicker way to reveal a character’s personality or describe their looks, but it always creates a weaker visual.
Please take a look at these examples…
SHALLOW: Charles was a fat man who couldn’t fit his bulky body onto the lawn chair. His pants ripped in the back when he sat down and his huge belly hung over his pants.
DEEP POV: Charles’ cheeks burned red as he squeezed himself down into the lawn chair. Rippp! His polyester golf pants split up the back, and his bulging stomach hung over the waistband.
***
Below is an excerpt from one of my novels, SHADOWY SECRETS to illustrate how to describe a character’s clothing and personality.
Please closely examine this example…
DEEP POV:
Trent shrugged off a worn leather jacket and draped it over an armchair, displaying a long-sleeved black shirt. The guy was the epitome of hip. With artfully mussed hair, low-slung jeans, motorcycle boots, and model good looks, just a glimpse of Trent Donovan caused female hormones to rage, teenage girls to swoon, and mouths to drool.
***
Here’s another character description taken from my Sci-Fi romance, LOST IN STARLIGHT. Please closely examine this example…
DEEP POV:
Hayden turns his head and his light brown fauxhawk falls over his forehead in a messy yet somehow deliberate way, landing over his one strikingly blue eye. The other one is green. Besides the rare heterochromia iridis, he seems to be just another smokin’ hot brainiac.
I add to my notes: Weird eye color and member of the Amazing Hair Club. Check.

Don’t forget to describe your characters by weaving in descriptions of clothing, age, hair and eye color, height, weight, visible scars, and even nationality, etc. into the scene. Writers should do it by lacing the physical characteristics throughout the action and dialogue.
Adding descriptions of hair may seem silly to some of you, but if you write young adult novels, it will add an extra layer of depth and realism to your storyline.
If a writer learns to sprinkle physical characteristics into a scene mixed with the action, dialogue, and introspection, it will enhance the storyline and enrich the reader’s experience. And I strongly suggest that each time a new character is introduced to the storyline, that the writer provides the reader with a visual illustration. Now, it doesn’t have to be a lengthy description of the character, a few well-placed descriptive words or action tags should be enough.
