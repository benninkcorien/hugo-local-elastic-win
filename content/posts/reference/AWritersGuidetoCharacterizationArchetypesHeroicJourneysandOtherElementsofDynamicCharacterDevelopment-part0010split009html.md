A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE MYSTIC
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, and this will not happen easily with the Mystic. She focuses on her own need for solitude and her spiritual pursuits.
She needs to learn to be assertive, to go out and experience life. If he’s a strong man, he can teach her to be assertive, but he has a busy schedule and may not be able to motivate her to go out.
He may be in awe of her spiritual, paranormal abilities. They may offer a great escape from his day-to-day grind, and he will look forward to seeing her.
He probably won’t believe in anything but science. For him, it must be proven to be real. This is where these two archetypes clash—he may even attack her core beliefs. On the other hand, she can’t understand why he wants to sit in a stuffy office and may respect a construction worker more than a businessperson.
