A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 15THE WHALENORMALCY & SELF-ACCEPTANCE
“As each family of whales has its own “song,” you too can find your soul song to recall those memories stored deep in your super conscious mind … Do not be guilty of wasting your own value, your own in-born strengths.” MrKay.org
The whale is one of the largest creatures on earth, and its home is the ocean, which is enormous. So in many respects the whale is the perfect size for its environment. The whale teaches us to feel normal and okay with who we are regardless of disabilities or past circumstances or anything else that may set us apart. This may apply to a character who has been in jail or experienced an addiction problem or was born with a disability.
The whale’s lesson is about finding the right environment and accepting yourself regardless of what others think. Some people may be more sensitive, meditative, or spiritual than others. They may see the world in a way that is different from how most others see it. Or they may be very inventive and simply need to find the right space and the right environment that will support them and let them grow.
It’s about being with other people who have gone through a similar ordeal or who have the same issue (good or bad). It’s about finding a place where you can flourish, once you accept yourself for who you are. The students who attend the mutant school in X-men are a good example.
This doesn’t mean you should isolate your hero from different experiences, environments, and people. It means simply that a part of the hero’s life should stand as a foundation for this unusual element, so that the hero can then go and do other things in a more holistic, balanced, and grounded way. This is especially important for the hero who has recovered from a past with addictions.
If the character tries to reject or deny this part of herself, her entire life will be thrown off balance because such radical self-denial feeds into a deep part of the psyche. It will be hard for the character to relate to and interact in other areas and other environments. Something else that’s inherent to the whale is the depth of the water. The deep water relates to the character’s depth of emotions.
Whales feel deeply, and their hearing is acute. Their sight is lacking, but to them poor sight is normal for the environment they are in. They are emotionally sensitive and have sensitive hearing.
Whales have a radical capacity for accepting things. For example, to them, there is no problem with their eyesight; it’s simply not needed. It would be unlike whales to feel like they are less than other creatures. The hero learning the whale’s lesson needs to accept whatever issue she is facing. She needs to find an environment in which she fits in so that she can not only blossom but deal with the emotional overwhelm that is most likely to come as she grows.
