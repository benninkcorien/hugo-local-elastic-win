A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE MATRIARCH
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. These are not goals she can help him achieve because she may need to learn the same things.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits her husband or family. With the Male Messiah she will probably be too occupied trying to make sure he doesn’t go off on a mission to examine what is truly important to her.
She loves to be in control and won’t be able to cope if he is so unpredictable. She may try to hold him close by issuing ultimatums, but he won’t be manipulated like that. He is perfectly fine on his own.
She will take care of everything and may feel like he’s taking her for granted. Regardless, she may feel a sense of pride in how altruistic he is.
If they are married, she won’t give up easily on him. Marriage is very important to her. If they aren’t married, she may be more lenient with him because she longs to be married. Although he respects her feelings, he is not that interested in marriage. He may marry to have a solid home base, but marrying is not a goal of his.
She respects his drive to help others and knows he loves her but she may do better with a more subservient man. On the other hand a more powerful husband can set limits on her ‘queendom,’ thus stopping her from taking over the kids’ lives.
