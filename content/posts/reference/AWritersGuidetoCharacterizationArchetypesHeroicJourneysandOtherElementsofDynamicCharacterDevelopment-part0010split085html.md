A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
The Sleeping Beauty Journey:
ACT I
   •  The innocent heroine is a victim of fate. There’s a stain on her perfect world.
   •  She feels lost and alone with no hope for anything better. Or she doesn’t even know there is a problem until she meets the Prince later on and feels what true happiness is.
   •  Others come along and try to help her but it doesn’t work.
   •  The wandering hero, who feels like something is missing goes about his life.
ACT II
   •  Something catches his eye and decides to go after it, taking a big risk.
   •  He finds the heroine and they both feel true happiness.
   •  Both of their lives are completely changed by this love. They are two completely different people than they were in the beginning of the story.
ACT III
   •  They fall deeper in love and make their plans, regardless of what others think.
   •  They are determined to be together regardless of the cost.
