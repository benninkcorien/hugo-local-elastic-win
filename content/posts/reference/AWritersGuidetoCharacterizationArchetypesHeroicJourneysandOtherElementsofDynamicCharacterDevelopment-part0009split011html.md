A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE MALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Protector understands having a cause or mission like the Male Messiah has. This is where they see eye to eye. The Protector can’t understand how the Male Messiah allows others to harm him instead of fighting back. Nonviolence is a foreign concept to the Protector.
The Male Messiah can teach the Protector to temper his emotions and to see the bigger picture, but doing so probably won’t stop the Protector from fighting back.
The Protector can teach the Male Messiah to be careful to avoid situations that force him to make a decision to fight back or not to begin with.
