A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE MATRIARCH
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
This is another opposing match. The Seductive Muse cannot handle all the planning, rules, and dictating that comes with the Matriarch. She needs to flow with life, not struggle against it or force it into a mold. Likewise the Matriarch cannot deal with how the Seductive Muse chooses to live her life. “Who will take care of her when she’s old?” the Matriarch wonders.
The one thing they agree on is that a man should provide for the woman he’s with. The way they “give back” to the man differs: The Matriarch raises a family and cares for the house, etc., while the Seductive Muse keeps herself beautiful and sensual. She’s her man’s fantasy. She knows she can (and is willing to) leave him at any time and that gives her power. The Matriarch will never leave her marriage. She finds power within her family unit.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Matriarch that control over life’s events is only illusory. She can help the Matriarch through a crisis.
The Matriarch can teach the Seductive Muse how wonderful it is to have a family to rely on.
