A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 8THE BUFFALOGRATITUDE & TRUST
“A Buffalo’s hump occurs at shoulder level, this implies that we must incorporate our own efforts. Shoulders are symbols of the ability to embrace and hold life…and our burdens or rewards. Afterall ‘The Lord helps those who help themselves’” —Ted Andrews (Animal Speak)
Buffalos have very humped shoulders and horns, indicating a shored- up sense of power, strength, and stamina. They are very strong and protective, yet somewhat noble and graceful. At the same time, their skins and meat have clothed, fed, and provided shelter to native peoples for so many years. Native Indians saw buffalos as an abundant source of life and were grateful and respectful of this animal’s presence on earth.
I remember traveling across the United States once and stopping at a park where buffalos hang out on the other side of a short wooden log fence. I was so in awe of their size and beauty, I didn’t make it back to the trailer in time, and my friends took off without me. Alone with the buffalos, I noticed how they graze in a group, respectful of each other, communicating with body language and receiving the abundance around them. (By the way: My friends did notice I was missing and came back for me.)
The lesson here is to learn how to be grateful for what you have and for what’s around you, and to recognize the abundance you have in your life so you can welcome more of it in. If you are not grateful for what you have, and you focus only on what you’re lacking, the people around you will not be quick to help you because you don’t respect or value what you already have. Why would the universe give you more to be ungrateful for?
You must respect the people around you, the resources around you, and the job that you have, even if you hate doing it. Your job deserves a certain amount of gratitude and respect because it is there for you if you need it. You can walk away from your job, if you really want to. Maybe you won’t be able to pay your rent, but you won’t cease to exist.
The following basic rules can apply to any area of life: Be grateful for what you have, see and respect the abundance around you, and trust that things will work out. It is spiritual and divine to know and trust that the universe will provide for you.
A note here: Inspirational stories fall into this lesson category. Sometimes they feel predictable because readers know going in that the hero will succeed. It’s important, therefore, to make the story about the path the hero takes and not only about the successful ending.
