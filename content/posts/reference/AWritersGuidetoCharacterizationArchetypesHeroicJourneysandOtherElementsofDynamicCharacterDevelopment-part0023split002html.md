A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini
Amir and Hassan have a best friend relationship that is one-sided. Hassan expresses brotherly love for Amir, but because of class differences, true friendship is not possible. Amir and his father Baba have a difficult relationship. Baba, wants to control what Amir is passionate about and what he should do in life, and Amir feels he’s never good enough. In Afghanistan, the characters live in different worlds, but when they move to America, without their servants to support them, they depend on each other. Other people (servants) enabled them to have a shallow relationship.
Wuthering Heights by Charlotte Bronte
One of the greatest love stories of all time, Wuthering Heights centers on the romantic relationships of several couples so as to explore numerous aspects of love and romance. It asks the big question of whether one can love another more than oneself.
