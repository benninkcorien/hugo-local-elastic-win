A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE MYSTIC
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and the AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. The Mystic is not the greater helper in this regard.
She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. As an adventurous man, the Woman’s Man can teach her to come out of her inner life and experience the senses.
He sees her as an easy woman to teach and mold. Since she’s not invested in societal rules and expectations, she can easily accept his eccentric ways. She’s just not used to playing around too much, even though she may be a very happy person. He can teach her to get in touch with her body and senses instead of numbing them in meditative pursuits. Gardening can be meditative, for instance.
He can be very supportive of her paranormal experiences. He may be in awe of her spiritual abilities, and he may even try to learn about them in detail. Maybe he can have the same experiences? He’s always up for something new and exciting. They will do well if she reciprocates and shows interest in his hobbies.
