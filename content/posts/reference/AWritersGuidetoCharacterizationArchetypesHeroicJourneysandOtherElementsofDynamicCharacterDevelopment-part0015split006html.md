A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
An unsuccessful resolution occurs when the hero uses his assertiveness in an aggressive way. He is pushed to his limits and unable to stand in a balanced assertive way. He gets a little too aggressive and sets his priorities in the wrong place. In the case of the character who needs to develop assertiveness, he backslides and winds up helping someone else to be more assertive.
In the end, this character has failed in one sense. But maybe this task was not the whole story. Learning this lesson might be a subplot or a character arc within a much larger arc. Maybe the character was not able to become assertive; instead he becomes accepting of himself: “Look, this is how I am, and I don’t feel comfortable with being that assertive. It’s just not me and I’m okay with that.” That’s an in-between kind of outcome, which is fine.
There are no real “have-tos” in life. A wrong use of power and assertiveness often leads to a tragic resolution for the character.
