A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TRAGIC RESOLUTION
In a tragic resolution, the heroine doesn’t get the lesson and messes up her life to the point that her goal cannot be achieved and her circumstances cannot be repaired. She must let go and move on. In an alternative version, she can learn the lesson in the end but she isn’t going to achieve her goal and in the meantime her whole life has changed. She learns the lesson, but it’s too late.
