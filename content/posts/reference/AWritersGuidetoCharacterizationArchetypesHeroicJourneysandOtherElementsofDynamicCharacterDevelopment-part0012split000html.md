A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 6ANIMALS AS ARCHETYPES
“Nothing can be truly beautiful if it has no function, so what’s the point in making art that has no message, telling stories that have no value, that serve no function for us.” —Russell Brand
Whether you are writing a character-driven piece or a plot-driven one, your character should travel down the path of a story arc. Along the way, the hero should learn something new. Your reader (hopefully) identifies with your hero and wants to grow as a result of spending time with your story. Your hero’s transformation is reflected in your story’s theme or message—an aspect of writing that many grapple with. The best way to dive into the elusive elements of theme and message is through the use of animal archetypal lessons.
For thousands of years, people have believed animals to be our spiritual helpers and guides. Many believe that if a person becomes more aware of a certain type of animal—seeing it in pictures, movies, or running into it in person—that the person should consider these awarenesses as ‘divine synchronicity’ and examine the energy that the animal is known for. In this way a person can consciously receive the lesson behind the animal archetype in his life, and he can move forward on his journey more easily with this lesson in mind. The lesson is, in fact, what the animal is ‘trying to teach us’ by coming into our lives, whether we are conscious of it or not. The animals are outward representations of an inward lesson.
