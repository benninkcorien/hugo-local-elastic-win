A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE AMAZON
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. The Amazon cannot teach him to value his manhood but she can teach him about self-respect. She can show him how to rely on and develop his body, but not in the sensual ways as the Seductive Muse would. He will most likely try to teach her how to be sensual.
The Amazon wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The Woman’s Man completely understands this, but he thinks finding one’s inner child is much more important. He doesn’t care about having a stable home base.
If she ever gets intense, he won’t respond to it. He will always try to keep a playful attitude. Either way he won’t be sucked into her latest cause. ‘Life is too short,’ he says.
She’s fine with a man who keeps to himself, but he won’t do that. He may want to change her, but she won’t have it. She may think he uses women, the way he loves ’em and leaves ’em, but he does help the women he comes into contact with.
She likes her own space, and he can be high maintenance. If she wants to go on a woman’s camping trip for a week, he may want to come along.
