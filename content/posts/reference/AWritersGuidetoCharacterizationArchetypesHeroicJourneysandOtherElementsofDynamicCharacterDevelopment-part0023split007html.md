A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
Showing things in the setting and props that convey pairs, couples, love, depth of feeling, poetry, and connection. Other couples in various stages in their relationship can appear. A child may push him to open up and successfully break down his walls. Children and animals can do such things because they don’t ask for much in return, whereas a love interest or group may ask for a big commitment of his time. True love is about the other instead of the self, and children and animals have a way of bringing this out naturally. Children are very honest, and pets can mirror our internal feelings and behaviors.
As the all-American hero: The workings of this lesson can show in the placement of a lot of different symbols and settings and costumes. You can include many things having to do with heroes—just the idea of what it is to be a hero and what it means to step up. You can have awards show up in the setting. For contrast you can have a character who does not have these things, or thinks the awards are a joke or ridiculous. Maybe he achieves things in other ways, sort of fumbling around because he does not have the hero’s skills, but he is able to achieve some goals and helps to save the day.
We have seen stories where the hero is at the top of his game and everything is great, and then for some reason or another he loses faith. He cannot pick himself up to even try to reach the goal anymore, so other characters step in and bungle around and try to do the job for him though it doesn’t help very much. In one way or another, however, their efforts eventually rally the hero to give it another go. Then the situation works itself out.
So other characters can inspire the hero in that way, and the dialogue can be very motivational, the mood and tone can be uplifting and very focused. After all, the eagle’s lesson is about focusing and keeping a goal in sight.
On the other hand, when the hero is failing, you could portray things as out of focus and kind of fuzzy. Supporting characters are not sure what is going on with the hero. This can add to the tension of wanting to get the hero back on track.
