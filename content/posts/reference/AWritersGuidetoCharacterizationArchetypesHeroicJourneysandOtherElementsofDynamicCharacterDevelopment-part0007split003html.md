A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE NURTURER
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two are somewhat alike in the way they are attuned to other people’s feelings. They are both great at expressing love, but the Seductive Muse focuses more on romantic love and the Nurturer focuses more on unconditional love.
While the Seductive Muse wants men in her life to provide for her, the Nurturer needs someone in her life to take care of. This need makes the Nurturer somewhat of a slave to other people’s demands. Being a slave to the demands of others is something the Seductive Muse, with her spontaneous lifestyle, can’t deal with.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Nurturer to nurture herself for a change. She can encourage her to stand up to other people’s demands.
The Nurturer can teach the Seductive Muse to care for someone other than herself and to realize the rewards of caring for and helping another even at great sacrifice to oneself.
