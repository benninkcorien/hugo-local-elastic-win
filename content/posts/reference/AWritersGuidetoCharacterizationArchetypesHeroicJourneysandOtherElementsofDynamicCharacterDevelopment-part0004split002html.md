A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
INTROVERSION AND EXTROVERSION
Introverts prefer the internal world of thoughts, feelings, fantasies, and dreams. Extroverts prefer the external world of things and people and activities.
FOR WRITERS: This means that a character that is extroverted will enjoy being around people and being outdoors. She will probably enjoy being in the spotlight more than an introvert will and she will be much more willing to speak in public. This type of personality is suited to a character such as an actor, dancer, leader, or politician.
Knowing whether your character is an introvert or extrovert can help you when you are selecting scene locations as well. Will your character be comfortable in the library? Would she be able to keep her mouth shut there? Extroverts tend to talk a lot while introverts prefer to write.
When you think along these lines, your scene locations become less arbitrary. They can contain subtext and meaning, and therefore they enhance the characterization.
The functions
Whether a person is an introvert or extrovert, he must deal with the world. And each person has a preferred way of dealing with it—a way he is comfortable with and good at. Jung suggests four basic ways, or functions, of dealing:
The first is sensing. Sensing means getting information via the senses. A sensing person is good at looking and listening and generally getting to know the world. Jung called this one of the irrational functions, meaning that it involves perceiving rather than judging information. Tangible immediate experience is valued over discussing or analyzing experience.
FOR WRITERS: This means a character will use what he sees, hears, and notices to make a decision. This type of character will think a person who can’t look him in the eye is lying.
“I know he loves me because of the kind words he says to me (hearing) and the things he does for me (seeing).”
The second is thinking. Thinking means evaluating information or ideas logically. Jung called this a rational function, meaning that it involves decision making or judging, rather than simple intake of information. It’s objective truth, impersonal analysis, and judgment.
FOR WRITERS: This means the character will process situations in the story by using logic, facts, and planning. Think of Spock in Star Trek. This type of character will likely think someone is lying because they either got the facts wrong or because they aren’t making logical sense.
“I know he loves me because we are good together (rational). We belong together and he must know that.”
The third function is intuiting. Intuiting is a kind of perception that works outside of the usual conscious processes. It is irrational or perceptual, like sensing, but comes from the complex integration of large amounts of information, rather than simply seeing or hearing. Jung said it was like seeing around corners. It’s all about possibilities and asking ‘What could happen?’
FOR WRITERS: This means the character will make decisions based on gut instinct rather than logic. He will use his sixth sense, and he has ideas and creative solutions that will go against the norm. He will know if someone is lying because he “just knows it.”
“I know she loves me because I just know it (intuition).”
The fourth is feeling. Feeling, like thinking, is a matter of evaluating information. A character who relies on feeling weighs her overall, emotional response. Jung calls it rational, but not in the usual sense of the word. It is all about what value something has over logical examination of it.
FOR WRITERS: This means the character will evaluate the world through the use of her feelings. She may be empathic. She consults herself before acting. “Can I do this? Is this good for me?” She will know if someone is lying because she’ll feel his nervousness.
“He loves me because I feel his love when I’m with him.”
One of these four functions is superior or dominates in each one of the archetypes, as you will see in the next two sections.
Among other things, such information can help you figure out what occupation each archetype is most suited for.
Each archetype is listed next with these elements mapped out for them, you can also look to my previous book, 45 Master Characters, for in-depth information on each archetype.
