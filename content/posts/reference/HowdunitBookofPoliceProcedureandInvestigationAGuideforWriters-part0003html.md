ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I wish I could take all the credit for writing this book, but I can't. Each page was a partnership of thoughts, memories, training, talents, and the combined experience of many law enforcement professionals, writers, medical experts, manufacturers of police equipment, and friends and family from all across the United States and Great Britain.
This cover-to-cover journey took me inside police departments, morgues, jails, prisons, police cars, SWAT vehicles, police academies, courtrooms, judges' chambers, prosecutors' offices, and sheriffs' offices. I had the wonderful opportunity to reunite with old friends and make new ones. The journey brought back a flood of memories — some good, some not so good.
It took more than two years to gather and distill this information to print. Without the help of the people I've listed below, I couldn't have accomplished such a monumental task. It would take a lifetime to repay all your kindness and hard work. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
There are certain people who have gone way above and beyond what I've asked of them. To those people I offer these words:
To my wife, Denene, I thank you for standing by me and allowing my dreams to come to fruition. It's because of you that I look forward to each and every day.
To Ellen, I thank you for growing into a fine young woman despite having had a cop for a father during what should've been your happiest, most carefree years. I know you had to do a lot of growing up on your own. You were a good kid and you've grown into a fine young woman. Thank you, too, for giving me a wonderful grandson, Tyler (my best buddy), and a talented son-in-law, John.
To Chris, I thank you for sharing your expertise in the martial arts and for giving us an amazing and ambitious daughter-in-law, Stephani.
To Bobbie Massey, my mother-in-law and first reader, I thank you for your support and confidence.
To Francis Thorne, I thank you for all you've done for Denene and me. I've never known a finer person.
To Brian, my brother, I thank you for many years of memories. I also thank you for riding with me on those nights while I was on patrol. You said you were interested in my work, but I know you really just wanted to make sure I was safe.
Crime Prevention Specialist Officer Dave Crawford took it upon himself to provide the majority of the photographs in this book. Dave also provided timely and detailed answers to my questions, no matter how trivial they might have been. Dave, I thank you for your tireless efforts.
To Sergeant Ed Buns, I thank you for introducing me to one of the finest police departments in the world, the Hamilton, Ohio, Police Department.
Ken Metz of the Yellow Springs, Ohio, Police Department also provided many of the photographs for the book. Ken went out of his way to provide current police information for the early stages of this book. Ken, your assistance was priceless.
I can't say enough good things about the staff at Writer's Digest Books. Jane Friedman has been absolutely wonderful; Claudean Wheeler is a brilliant artist; and Kelly Nickell is absolutely one of the finest editors in the business. Working with Kelly on this project has been a joy. I'm proud to be a part of the Writer's Digest Books family.
I also can't say enough about my dear friend, editor, teacher, and fellow writer Becky Levine. Becky has provided me with guidance and encouragement, and her superb editing skills have made this book much more interesting than I could have ever made it. I'm forever grateful to her. Then there's Becky's family, David and Ian. David makes the best gumbo on earth and never fails to feed me when I'm on the West Coast. Ian, well, he's just Ian, one of the best kids I've ever met.
I'm honored and thrilled to have this book introduced by the words of the 2006 Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and one of the greatest writers of our time, Stuart Kaminsky. Thank you, Stuart, for writing the foreword.
I could write something special about each and every person who helped with this project, but space won't allow me to do so, so I've attempted to list everyone below. If I've forgotten anyone, I wholeheartedly apologize. There are just so many people to thank, and age no longer walks hand-in-hand with my memory.
