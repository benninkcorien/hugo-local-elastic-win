A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHICH FEMALE ARCHETYPE SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?
Use the following questionnaire to help you figure out which archetype is most suited for your heroine (or for yourself for that matter). Doing so will help you decide which archetype fits your story idea best and push you to consider archetypes you may not have otherwise considered. You may find that some of them will drastically change your story direction for the better.
This quiz is inspired by one available at http://goddess-power.com/questions.htm
Answer each of the following ten questions for your character, rating each of the answers to that question, as it is true or not true for your character:
3 Strongly True/Agree
2 True/Agree
1 Almost True/Agree
-1 Not True/Disagree
Write the above score next to each lettered answer for every question. After you are finished (not before) you will find the corresponding letters for each answer to each question arranged underneath each of the Archetypes in columns. Simply enter the score you wrote next to its letter. I know this may sound confusing, but trust me, it will all make sense. Just take it one step at a time.
So for each question you will score EVERY possible answer. All of those answers have a corresponding letter in the answer chart that follows. Once you finish and view the chart, you should be able to figure this out. More instructions are found on the chart.
This means that on question 1 of this made-up example, the answer that follows letter B applies to the Nurturer while the answer that follows letter D applies to the Mystic. If you scored a 3 for letter B and –1 for letter D that means your character is most likely a Nurturer. Since there are ten questions, you will add up all the scores that fall underneath the Nurturer’s Column to get an overall score.
Granted your characters may have a high score in more than one column. This is perfectly fine—in life we are influenced by many archetypes—it’s only in fiction and in film that one archetype dominates each character. As a result, the characters are more believable and consistent.
If your character scores high in more than one column, then you have an opportunity to make a choice about this character. Go back and look over the archetypes and decide which one you want to bring out more.
