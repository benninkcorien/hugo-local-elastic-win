TRAGIC RESOLUTION
An unsuccessful outcome occurs when the hero lets other characters put him down or take away his confidence. He stops pushing himself and doesn’t go for what he wants. He feels like he can’t do it. Or maybe he attempts to go through it and he comes out of it and something happens, but he has not quite achieved the goal and won’t try again.
