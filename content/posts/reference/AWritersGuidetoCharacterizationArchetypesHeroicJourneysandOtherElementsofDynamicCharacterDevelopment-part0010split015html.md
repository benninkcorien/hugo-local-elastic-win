A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE NURTURER
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Nurturer. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. Unfortunately being the caretaker that she is, the Nurturer won’t stand up to him (at least not in the beginning). She will try to support him, and she will work to change him, but such changes rarely last.
She needs to let go of her attachment to others and find her own identity, two things the Protector cannot help her with. He may provide a sturdy home base from which she can work on her issues, but he won’t understand what she is dealing with.
Wanting her attention focused on him, he may not like her helping other people so much. Anything physical is important to him, so when she physically takes care of others, he may get jealous.
She would be a great match for a protector, who pushes others away with his intense outbursts, because she won’t leave him without giving him another chance. If he ever comes between her and those she cares about (or cares for), however, the sparks will fly.
