A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE MYSTIC
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and the AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations, both of which happen to be the Mystic’s specialty. She can teach him self-control and to see the big picture when he gets upset.
She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. As someone who sees a lot of beauty in the world, he can help bring her out of her shell. As someone who is willing to stand up to others, he can also teach her to be assertive.
Her quiet demeanor allows him to spend hours in her company. He may even want to make her the subject of his creative project.
She loves his creativity, for it comes from deep within the soul.
He may be in awe of her spiritual and paranormal abilities, and he may even try to learn about them in detail. Maybe the experience will help his creative work.
She enjoys her alone time so she’s fine if he locks himself in his studio for hours or days at a time. He loves that about her, but sometimes he may try to get a rise out of her just for the sake of excitement.
