A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE ARTIST
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These archetypes are opposites, especially where emotions and drama are concerned. The Artist is all about drama and emotionality. The Male Messiah is detached from the drama of everyday life.
The Male Messiah can teach the Artist to look at the bigger picture when ‘drama’ comes into his life. so he can avoid the blame game. He can show the Artist how to be self-aware so that the Artist can recognize when he is becoming emotional before it happens.
The Artist can help the Male Messiah understand the emotions all the people around him are feeling, as well as the games they are playing.
