A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
In many stories, the hero wants to do things himself and thinks that sharing responsibility or asking for help is a sign of weakness.
So, the hero may resist having to learn this because he is living in a state of crisis or he wants the recognition for himself and going it alone will insure he gets full credit. He doesn’t trust anybody else to handle the task at hand. It seems easier to handle it himself than to try to train other people and work with them when in the end there is no guarantee they’ll get the job done.
