A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE COYOTE’S CHARACTER ARC
It is interesting to see a story that is about getting to a place of foolishness, where you can laugh at yourself and indulge in your playful side. We have seen the inventive and resourceful side of this lesson portrayed in stories quite a bit. For instance, many stories show characters who need to face breaking the rules in order to do the right thing and save the day.
A lot of kids’ stories incorporate this element of ‘loosening up’ because kids like to see adults act more like children. The coyote trickster character can be the catalyst that changes the adult while the children remain untouched.
Many laugh quite a bit watching The Hangover, whose cast includes an anal-retentive dentist who loosens up to the point of marrying a stripper and losing one of his teeth. The consequences that the friends face are hilarious, but in the end they need to tone down their crazy ways. They almost went too far and got punished for it.
