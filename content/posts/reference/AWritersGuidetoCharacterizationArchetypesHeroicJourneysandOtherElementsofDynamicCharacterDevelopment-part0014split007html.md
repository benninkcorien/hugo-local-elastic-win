A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
Symbols of abundance and gratitude, and a love of life can appear in the mood and tone. You can juxtapose dark and light scenes, sunny or rainy days, dingy or super-clean locations. The heroine’s apartment may be a cluttered mess, and she might partake in bad habits and you can include props that hint at how she spends her time.
Consider letting the facial expressions (subtext) of other characters impart the effect she has on the outside world. When she is talking to a friend, for instance, you might show that person’s telling look of pity or dissatisfaction as they listen to what she says.
Other characters could illustrate the need to learn a similar lesson. Maybe a wealthy character in the subplot remains unsatisfied, though he has an abundance of money. Perhaps this guy isn’t grateful for what he has because he knows everything can be taken away from him at anytime. The heroine might look down on this character, thinking, “What’s the matter with him? If I had those millions I would be doing great…” She does not see the parallel to her own life.
