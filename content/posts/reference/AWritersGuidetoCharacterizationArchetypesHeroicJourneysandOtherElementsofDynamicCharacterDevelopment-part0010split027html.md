A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. She can help him relax and see the beauty in the world. However, her naive nature may lose its appeal after a while and she may require too much attention.
She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times, but can also share in his desire for solitude. She can easily grasp all of his otherworldly interests and be a great conversationalist. But sooner or later she may get bored with his loner lifestyle.
She must learn to stand on her own two feet. The Recluse will push her to do that, as he doesn’t want to be responsible for her. Even though he’s around most of the time, he always doing his own thing.
She may look up to him, when he’s around. If she has a crisis and he’s not available, the sparks can fly when she sees him again. He won’t be guilted; he can spot manipulation a mile away.
