SENSORY DETAILS
SENSORY DETAILS
Quote: “Place matters to me. Invented places matter more.” —bestselling author, Alice Hoffman
Deeper POV removes bland storytelling by including sensory details and cranks the narrative up a notch. Having realistic emotions and expressions will pull readers deeply into the heads and hearts of the characters by allowing the story to be seen, experienced, and felt through the close-and-personal POV of the character.
If done correctly, Deep POV rids a story of unneeded phrases like he thought, he knew, he heard, he smelled, he felt (when it applies to emotions), he wondered, he saw that cause author intrusion. (Reminder: it is always okay to use shallow “telling” words in dialogue.)
Another huge advantage of applying the Deep POV method to your writing is offering the reader direct access to the character’s moods, emotions, and perceptions.  A character needs the ability to describe what she/he experiences as it occurs.
The most obvious way of telling and the number one red flag is to state the emotion or reaction. A better way is to show them through facial expressions, internal-monologues, and body language.
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW: The smell was awful and made me feel sick.
DEEP POV: I covered my nose and tried not to gag at the offensive stench.
Remember that “stating the emotion or reaction” for a reader is telling. The correct way is to show by describing what is unfolding in every scene by the use of action, “voice,” dialogue, facial expressions, and the five senses, etc.
Writers can tell a reader that when Harry steps into the kitchen, he notices a stinky smell, but it is much more creative to show. Sometimes showing is more descriptive and wordy than just stating the facts, but where’s the fun in that, right?
Please examine these examples…
SHALLOW:
When Harry went into the kitchen, he noticed there was a stinky smell coming from the sink. He realized that it was apparent that no one had washed the dishes in a very long time.
Sure, the shallow example gets to the point and states the facts, but let’s be honest, it’s bland and flat. Now compare this one written in Deeper POV.
DEEP POV:
The second Harry stepped through the kitchen doorway, a raucous odor wafted from the sink and made his nose wrinkle. “Gross! When was the last time anyone cleaned the dishes?”
The second example was more impactful, right?
Please examine these next examples…
SHALLOW:
While I changed into my gym clothes, I watched my best friend Dana carefully. I noticed that she looked overly excited to go workout with weights and gym equipment. I knew something was going on with her, and I decided to find out.
That example was too bland and gives the reader a weak visual.
DEEP POV:
Grunting, I yanked on my tight gym clothes, while my best friend Dana was humming to herself and prancing around the stuffy locker room.
Once she’d finished dressing in a brand-new workout outfit, she turned to me all smiles. “Ready to get sweaty?”
“Since when do you like cardio?” I propped a hand on my love handle, protruding over the waistband of my sweats. “Are you crushing on that new trainer, Sergio?”
Dana twirled around like a ballerina in her glaring white tennis shoes. “Oh, yeah…”

Showing (Deep POV) makes your readers become even more emotionally invested in your wonderful story. One way to do that is for writers to use specific words to describe how things smell, how certain foods taste, how objects feel, how the setting sounds, and looks through your character’s eyes.
Why keep your readers at arm’s length, when you can pull them in close-and-personal?
Recognizing the difference between showing and telling is the most crucial skill a writer needs for stronger storytelling.
