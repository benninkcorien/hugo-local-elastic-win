EMOTION: PANIC
EMOTION: PANIC
Quote: “Basically, a panic attack is triggered by a thought. The thought itself could be originated by a variety of things, either it could come out of the blue, be a response to an outside stimuli or result from a long reflection...” —Alex, Reference for Writers blog
Panic is closely related to the emotion fear, and it also ties into worry or anxiousness. It is an emotion that brings upon a sudden sensation of terror or dread so strong that it can dominate or prevent rational thinking and cause overwhelming feelings of apprehension. 
The important thing about writing any type of fiction is to always draw the reader deeply into the scene by relying on the POV character’s senses and descriptions to paint a detailed picture, as though the reader is deeply experiencing everything right alongside the narrator.
If a character is having “panic attacks,” it can add an extra layer of characterization to your story. When a character is experiencing a panic attack, it is common to feel their heart pounding, sweating, hyperventilating, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, tunnel vision, body shaking, etc. A character can become frozen and unable to move or react, or even defend themselves. Using short, choppy sentences to describe panic might work best.
Some physical signs of panic might be:
Tension in neck, back, shoulders
Unable to sit still
Crossed arms
Breathing faster and shallower
Clearing Throat
Trembling hands
Sweating
Bug-eyed
Mouth freezes / unable to speak
Pupils are small and un-dilated
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I felt panicked.
DEEP POV: My stomach felt queasy and my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.
SHALLOW: He was unnerved by the baby crying.
DEEP POV: With quivering hands, he lifted the wailing baby from the crib.
SHALLOW: I felt really flustered this morning.
DEEP POV: My breath became fast and shallow.
SHALLOW: When he saw the huge phone bill, he panicked.
DEEP POV: The phone bill crinkled in his sweaty fist.
SHALLOW: I felt panicky when Tom asked me to lunch.
DEEP POV: Big knots formed in my stomach.
SHALLOW: I felt unnerved.
DEEP POV: My insides felt like jelly.
SHALLOW: I felt a bout of panic. How could I pay my bills this month?
DEEP POV: Clutching collar of my shirt, I stared at the zeros on my bank statement.
SHALLOW: I felt like a nervous wreck. (Cliché)
DEEP POV: My mouth went dry and I couldn’t sit still.
SHALLOW: I was feeling overly anxious.
DEEP POV: I wanted to run out the nearest exit.

Here are two longer examples of showing panic instead of stating it for the reader taken from one of my short stories.
The first scene has too much shallow writing, and the scene is lacking any “voice” or sensory details. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please carefully examine these two examples…
SHALLOW:
When I opened my eyes, I noticed it was still dark in the room. Feeling half-asleep, I got out of bed and headed into the bathroom. It must be late, I thought to myself. We had been on the run from the mobsters for three days and I felt very exhausted.
Then I looked in the mirror. At first, I didn’t recognize the face I saw reflected in it. I felt a headache come upon me. After washing my hands, I looked in the cabinet for aspirin, but I realized there wasn’t any inside. So I left the bathroom, but then I stopped in the middle of the bedroom.
An unsettling feeling of panic welled inside me. I realized that something wrong, but I couldn’t quite decide what it was. The atmosphere felt really strange. Anxiety was building up within me.
Suddenly, I realized what it was when I looked at the bed. I realized that my friend Elena was no longer in the room. I turned on the light and looked around the room. I noticed that her purse and shoes were gone.
I felt terrified. I looked at my watch and saw that it was almost midnight. Where had she have gone at this hour? Why hadn’t she told me that she was leaving? Why had she left me alone in a hotel room? When would she return? Should I call her cell phone?
Now I felt really alarmed and worried. Hastily, I put on my jacket, then my shoes. I went out the door in a blind panic. (cliché) I knew I had to catch her before the mobsters did.
This second scene is the final draft that was revised to show the reader that the character starts to panic without stating it, and includes more detailed descriptions and a deeper character POV.
DEEP POV:
A soft click awoke me. I blinked into the dimness of the stuffy room, the faint glow of the bedside clock glowed eerily in the darkness. A sharp throbbing spread across my forehead, and I winced.
I fumbled with the scratchy blankets and stumbled into the bathroom, where I caught my reflection in the mirror. Being on the run from bloodthirsty mobsters hadn’t done much for my complexion. Bloodshot eyes rimmed with dark circles and ashen skin made the face reflected back at me almost unrecognizable.
Opening the cabinet, I searched for aspirin, but only found a small bar of scented soap and a bottle of shampoo. I shuffled back into the bedroom and glanced at the bed. Even before my mind registered the emptiness, I knew she wasn’t lying there.
Flipping on the overhead light, I scanned the room. My mouth dried. I couldn’t swallow.
I spotted a leather wallet peeking out from under the jumbled pile of clothes. Sweat prickled my underarms and down my back. I hurried to the closet and checked inside. My garments were pushed to the far side, leaving a gap where her clothes should have been.
Spinning on my heel, I yanked on my jacket, shoved my bare feet into shoes, and bolted from the room.

If you’re a beginner writer working on your first manuscript, or if you’re reading this book to gain more knowledge and insight on the topic, I implore you to start using Deeper POV in all of your stories. You’ve heard the saying, “Practice makes perfect,” right? After you finished at least five drafts of your current work-in-progress (WIP), it is time to go back and revise those shallower areas.
