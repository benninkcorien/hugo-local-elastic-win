SHALLOW: RELAX
SHALLOW: RELAX
Quote: “One of the most common characterization mistakes writers make is granting their characters too much self-awareness. That sly pitfall puts tension at risk, limits believability, and inhibits the ability to show rather than tell.” —fiction coach, editor, and writer, MJ Bush
To avoid stating the character’s emotional state, like he/she relaxed, a writer can show a character taking a breather or loosening up in slower, reflective scenes.
Relaxing is a physical response to a lot of different emotions or events. For instance, if the character was almost caught stealing, but then managed to allude the cops, they would relax or calm down.
If the character had been tense or worrying about something, once it was resolved, they might visibly relax their posture or the stiffness in their shoulders.
Or if the character is feeling relieved after a strange turn of events within the storyline, and the writer wants to give the character a short reprieve before ramping up the action or tension again, they could show them unwinding.
Some physical signs of relaxing might be:
Breathing becomes slow and deep
Muscles become less tense
Yawning and stretching
Cracking the neck
Torso sags slightly to one side
Shoulders are not tensed up
Limbs hang loosely
Legs casually flung out
Putting hands behind head
Forehead lines un-creased
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I saw my dad trying to relax before saying, “Okay. Tell me everything.”
DEEP POV: My dad stretched out his arms, then let them drop. “Okay. Tell me everything.”
SHALLOW: Tommy felt nervous, but then he relaxed. “It wasn’t me. Honest,” he said mildly.
DEEP POV: Tommy shook out his hands and kept his voice steady. “It wasn’t me. Honest.”
SHALLOW: I felt tense and I decided to try to relax.
DEEP POV: Tension stiffened my posture and made my jaw tight. I rolled my shoulders, trying to draw the stress away from my muscles.
SHALLOW: Trent wanted to relax, but it was difficult until he exhaled.
DEEP POV: Trent held in a breath, and then slowly released it.
SHALLOW: I felt determined to relax my body.
DEEP POV: I forced myself to unclench my fists.
SHALLOW: Lydia felt wound up and upset, but she needed to relax.
DEEP POV: Lydia pushed the air from her lungs, and the tension left her body.
SHALLOW: I wanted to ease the tension and calm down.
DEEP POV: I took a few deep breaths to steady myself.
SHALLOW: She forced herself to release the tension in her chest.
DEEP POV: She lowered eyelashes, and she let the breath swoosh from her lungs.
SHALLOW: I couldn’t relax until I knew I was safe.
DEEP POV: Breath returned to me in a rush. I was finally safe.
SHALLOW: She decided to throw in the towel (cliché) as she said wearily, “Just bite my neck, Edward.”
DEEP POV: Her shoulders sagged, her voice soft. “Just bite my neck, Edward.”
Here are two longer scenes that illustrate how to avoid shallower writing and embrace a Deeper POV. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please closely analyze these two very different scenes…
SHALLOW:
“I need to find and kill that warlock,” I said gravelly because I could not relax. “He might hurt my grandfather.”
I saw my brother Peter visibly relax and I felt him wrap his arms around my shoulders. “I think you are ready to fight the warlock. Please try to be careful, sister,” he whispered softly, then I saw him sped off down the hall.
I felt my body unwind as I watched him go into the kitchen. I turned to Ryan and breathed a sigh of relief. (cliché)
“Are you ready?” I asked Ryan honestly.
I saw him hold out his hand and I took it. I felt him squeeze it gently. “It’ll be okay,” he reassured calmly, but I didn’t believe him.
I looked around at the room, at how empty the living room was and felt a little disappointed when I realized that my best friend hadn’t shown up yet. I’d texted her the night before, but I realized she thought that there was no reason to say goodbye to someone who was going to risk her life to fight a warlock.
I looked into Ryan’s blue eyes. “She didn’t come to say farewell,” I told him matter-of-factly.
“No, she didn’t,” he stated truthfully. “But I am here.”
“I guess there is no need to wait. I will right back,” I told him and headed toward my grandfather’s office.
DEEP POV:
“I need to kill that warlock.” My posture stiffened “Before he tries to hurt Grandpa.”
“Yes, yes. I agree. You’re ready to face your enemy.” My brother Peter rolled his shoulders, then wrapped his arms around me in a quick hug. “Please try to be careful, Sis,” he whispered, then sped off down the hall and into the kitchen.
I blew out a breath and the tension in my body lessened. I turned to Ryan and slightly smiled. “Ready to do this?”
He nodded, then took my hand, and squeezed it gently. “It’ll be okay.”
But I didn’t believe him. Fighting a warlock to protect my family was high up on the crazy scale.
My gaze swept over the empty living room and my stomach dropped. My best friend hadn’t shown up. I’d texted her the night before, but maybe saying goodbye to someone who was going to fight a warlock was too hard.
I gazed into Ryan’s blue eyes, then pulled my hand free of his. “She didn’t come to say goodbye,” I said, lowering my head and kicking at the ground with my scuffed combat boot.
He shrugged. “No, she didn’t…but I’m here.”
“Guess there’s no need to wait. I’ll right back.” I marched out the door with my head held high and entered my grandfather’s office.

Just remember that anytime a writer can remove the sensory “tell” from a scene and clearly describe whatever it is the character saw or felt or tasted or heard or smelled, it will automatically enhance the reading experience for the audience.
