A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE MAIDEN
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. She can’t help him with these things because she needs to learn the same lessons.
She needs to stand on her own two feet. The Artist wants to take care of her, but he can’t always be emotionally available for her. He’s focused on himself and his projects a lot. He is probably around much of the time so she doesn’t have to be alone to figure out what’s important to her.
She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times and can share in his desire for travel and new experiences. He may not bother with explosive situations with her around. She’s too easygoing and innocent for that. She may captivate him.
The Artist can feel young again around her, and his creativity may sparkle again. She is another Muse. He may become too intense or passionate for her, starting arguments just to stir things up.
She enjoys his emotional side, and they can have many romantic nights together.
