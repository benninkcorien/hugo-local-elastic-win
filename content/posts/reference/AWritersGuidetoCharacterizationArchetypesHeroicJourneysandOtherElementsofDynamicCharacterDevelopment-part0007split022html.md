A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE NURTURER AND THE MAIDEN
EMOTIONAL VS. EMOTIONAL
This relationship will have codependency written all over it, if the Nurturer and the Maiden are not careful. The Maiden loves to be taken care of and the Nurturer is only too happy to oblige. She may view the Maiden as the daughter she never had.
They can spend hours together at a time, neither judging the other for her choices in life. It’s great for all Maidens to have a Nurturer in their life.
The Maiden has a natural gift of guiding others and the Nurturer can help her develop this gift. Simply seeing all the Nurturer does for others will influence the Maiden. She will learn respect for the healing arts and see compassion in action.
The Maiden can teach the Nurturer how to be more carefree and less worrisome, to trust the flow of life and live in the moment.
