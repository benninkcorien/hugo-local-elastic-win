A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE DEER’S CHARACTER ARC
For the character arc, the hero might need to live more in the present, even if it’s just in order to negotiate a business deal.
The hero needs to:
   •  Be more aware of what is not being said
   •  Know what people may be doing in the periphery
   •  Hear what’s going on below the surface
   •  See what’s coming before it happens
   •  Be able to plan for different options
   •  Have a plan B ready at all times
He must learn his lesson in a way that is not fanatical, radical, obsessive, or fearful. Show it in a very calm sort of way.
You could have a hero who is more tyrannical and fearful, and always looking for the next bad thing to happen to him. This is prey-like, in that he is waiting for something or someone to come along and possibly do him harm. But then he starts to understand that he can plan. He can foresee a lot of things. He can calm down and use his intuition and his gut, and at some point he just has to let go and trust that he will be able to observe and protect himself if necessary. He will not allow fear to change him or push him into a bad decision.
