A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHAT IS THIS ‘THEME’?
Theme can be a message, a moral, a point of view, a teaching, or an insight. In fiction it is usually left unsaid and thus something the reader has to figure out for himself. When a reader discovers the theme, it gives her a feeling of satisfaction at having found a deeper purpose in a story.
It is the theme that allows the writer to connect deeply with the reader or audience. This connection is what elevates a story and makes it a classic, or makes it at least memorable.
Conversely books in which no theme exists usually upset readers. When readers don’t learn anything from the experience of reading the book, a sense of emptiness results. People give up several hours of their valuable time to read a book, and they’d like to feel that they have been entertained and enlightened when they come to the end. They trust the writer to pull them out of their everyday lives for a while.
“Theme is as viable a place to begin a story as any other. When that first core competency of a story is theme, you’ve already got a literary tiger by the tail. Because great stories always have strong themes. But what about those who begin with theme? How does that happen, and where do those ideas come from? The answer is almost always the same—it comes from the heart. From a need to explore or proclaim a point of view about a truth, an issue, an irony or a feeling that stems from the human experience.” —Larry Brooks (Story Engineering)
You can use animal archetypes in other ways, as the following will show, but for most of you reading this book using an animal archetype as a thematic character lesson is most appropriate.
The following examples illustrate how animals have been used in fairy tales to explore experiences, symbolize characteristics, make a point regarding relationships, and show humans crossing into extraordinary worlds. Feel free to apply the animal archetypes in this way if doing so suits your story. Once you understand the deeper meanings behind the many animal archetypes, you can craft a very interesting story using animals as heroes.
Marina Warner of The Guardian writes:
“The anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss commented that animals were “bons à penser” (good to think with), and fairytales speak through beasts to explore common experiences—fear of sexual intimacy, terror and violence and injustice, struggles for survival. A tradition of articulate, anthropomorphised creatures of every kind is as old as literature itself: animal fables and beast fairytales are found in ancient Egypt and Greece and India, and the legendary Aesop of the classics has his storytelling counterparts all over the world, who use crows and ants, lions and monkeys, ravens and donkeys to satirise the follies and vices of human beings and display along the way the effervescent cunning and high spirits of the fairytale genre.” (http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/oct/16/beastly-tales-warner)
I have always been drawn to animals and when I first started studying the Goddess and God archetypes for 45 Master Characters, I came across these animal archetypes and sensed they would help with character development but was unsure how to apply them at the time.
After writing many stories of my own, I noticed that these archetypes not only worked their way into my stories, but made a great impact on them and on how people received my work. Readers seemed to really know my characters, as if the characters were very real. Readers couldn’t quite say why they felt this way, but I believe it has a lot to do with the lessons embedded in my stories.
You may recognize some of the character lessons you find here, but I have presented them in a new light, by stressing their archetypal significance. While a character can find herself in countless situations (see my book Story Structure Architect, where I explore fifty-five of them), these archetypes illustrate deeper lessons that reach across culture and hit at a primal level. Animals are primal and instinctual, and that is why they embody the lessons so well. You can’t go wrong using any of the animal archetypes because they resonate with readers on a subconscious level.
If you don’t want to use these lessons for your hero in your main plot, consider using them for a supporting character in your main plot. You may also use them for your hero in your subplot.
Depending on your story, you may choose to use one lesson or several lessons. The more lessons you use, the more layers you will weave through the story. Your hero becomes more rounded by butting up against a lesson and in turn the story itself comes alive. But be careful not to overdo it.
Some of the lessons overlap a bit. This is a product of applying them to storytelling and helping you see how to use them effectively when the lesson is intangible or inwardly focused. When possible, I give examples and ways to illustrate the lesson in a dramatic way. Some lessons are so important that several animals contain some aspect of the lesson, however, a different arc takes the character through it.
Ask yourself:
   •  What is my hero’s main goal?
   •  Does it include an archetypal lesson?
   •  If not, should it? Or should you place it in a subplot?
   •  Which archetypal lesson can best interfere with him reaching his goal?
   •  Make a list of ways you can illustrate this lesson, subtly weaving these clues to the thematic message into your story.
As far as using these animal archetypal lessons with the main archetypes found in the beginning of this book and in 45 Master Characters: Any archetype can face any animal archetypal lesson. These lessons are for all of us. Some archetypes will naturally have learned a lesson or two and not need to face them again. There is a lot of room for creativity here.
You just have to:
   •  Absorb the information.
   •  See the possibilities.
   •  Take notes.
   •  And work out your character arc.
Remember these lessons are where a character is going, what they are learning. If you choose a lesson that is about joy, that does not mean you are writing joyful scenes for your character. It means you are challenging your character to find and learn about joy. Joy and suffering are not far apart in life.
Theme is about what the character will learn in the end. You have to get him to the end and challenge him along the way. You decide both if and how the characters get there.
SIDE NOTE:
If any of these animal archetypes conjures strong emotions for you as you read, you may want to consider that the animal you are reading about is trying to teach you a lesson on a personal level. It’s impossible for me to cover all of the animal archetypal lessons here. These are the ones most applicable to writing stories.
