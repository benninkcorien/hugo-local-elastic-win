A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE HORSE’S CHARACTER ARC
The horse must learn to stop trying to control: He must stop trying to control other people, as well as the outcomes of events. He must also stop trying to dominate. He has in the past forced his will upon others. His character arc will take him to a place where he learns to work in harmony with others and he forms companionships that move forward in a way that instills freedom and truthfulness within himself and others.
As human beings, our fears, insecurities, and life histories cause us to grasp at things. We want to own things, we want to hold things, we want to control things, and we want to experience the sense of security that doing so creates.
However, in order to truly be free, we must let go. We must be truthful, relax, and move toward our goals in a state of allowing, not grasping or controlling or trying to dominate. We must allow the freedom of expression, relationship, and ideas to materialize in an organic way. The lesson is to be truthful with oneself about how one is feeling and what one wants to accomplish and why.
If the hero is clear about her goal and knows why she wants to obtain her goal, she can let go and allow the universe to help her. She won’t need to control everything including her journey. Things will begin to fall in place for the character. Much like the horse who would not come near me when my thoughts were negative or when I tried to force it to follow me.
