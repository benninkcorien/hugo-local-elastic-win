A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 17THE EAGLEDEEP RELATIONSHIPS & PATRIOTISM
“Eagle represents the deepest and most spiritually awakened form of relationships, often requiring the complete surrender of a previously held way of life or attitude. In essence Eagle medicine relates to right relationship—relationship with self, god, partners, nature, society…” —Askaura.com
Everything about an eagle is set up for a specific purpose. The talons, the beak, the eyes, and the feathers all have very distinct purposes in helping the eagle survive. The talons serve the purpose of killing prey, and the shape of the beak is set up to tear apart, eat, and consume the prey.
The eagle is interesting because it teaches the lesson of creating deep relationships and of having clarity; and then it also is the skewed symbol for political freedom (the all-American hero), which appears quite a bit in action movies.
Eagles mate for life in a dazzling and dangerous spectacle of soaring to great heights then free-falling, as a pair, over and over again. The lesson is in learning how to develop true intimacy and relationship with others—to take the plunge.
As human beings, the biggest risk we take in life is opening up to love and allowing others inside our hearts. Many of us get married but never fully open to love. Many of us are religious but never fully open to the divine. A vulnerability must be faced in order to be worthy of gifts of love. It’s like stripping away our feathers and talons, and being exposed for a time.
There can be barriers to this:
   •  Other people can enable us to live at a distance.
   •  Our past trauma can compel us to do so.
   •  Self-centeredness can stop us from connecting to someone else.
   •  Without a role model, a lack of examples can leave us devoid of skills or knowledge to develop this essential part of life.
