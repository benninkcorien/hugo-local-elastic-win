Matching a Knife to a Character, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Matching a Knife to a Character
When assigning a knife to a character, writers enjoy much more wiggle room compared to firearms. It’s more important to get the knife type right than it is to reference a specific model.
Therefore, this section will focus on matching a character to a knife type, not to a specific knife. Writers can stop the search at the end of the step-by-step instruction, or they can use the result they come to as a launching pad to investigate specific models. I like any excuse to go to a sporting goods stores, but that’s just me.
Remember, it’s perfectly acceptable to use the generic term knife if it saves time and trouble. But when a knife matters a good deal to writing a character, follow these steps for the best match.
1. What Is the Role of the Character?
What part does the character play in the story? A police officer on patrol? A cranky private investigator living in a rattrap RV? Identical twins selling goat burgers outside a flea market? This identification is the first step in assigning a knife.
2. How Will the Knife Be Used?
What cutting tasks are on deck for the knife? From opening mail to gutting a thief, this is important to know ahead of time.
The most common knife tasks in thrillers and crime fiction are:
attacking
dismemberment
intimidation/effect
mundane cutting jobs
outdoor work (utilitarian tasks involving wood, rope, chores, etc.)
self-defense
Choose one or more, then go to the next step.
3. How Hard Will the Knife Be Used?
Knives can only take so much before they fail. Physically large cutting jobs require more rugged knives (think of hacking through a dense jungle or a side of beef). Delicate cutting jobs are reserved for a similar type of knife suited for gentler use (such as digging out a bullet from a wound).
With that in mind, how hard will the knife be used?
very hard (anything that exerts a great amount of pressure on the blade)
somewhat hard (a workout akin to cutting up a chicken)
not hard (levels of pressure similar to opening mail or shaving)
4. How Much Does Stealth Matter?
A steak knife doesn’t offer much in the way of stealth; it’s hard to conceal. On the other hand, a folding knife slips easily into the pocket. This can be crucial to a pivotal plot point.
How much stealth is required for the character?
a lot
some
none
5. How Skilled Is the Character?
Knife skills matter, and slicing cheese doesn’t make a person an expert. I’ve witnessed all sorts of people catch a cut from their own blades—including those very familiar with knives.
Setting the skill level for a character matters. Is this someone with a lot of knife know-how? Or is a plastic picnic knife the only thing she has ever picked up? Choose from the following skill levels:
beginner
intermediate
expert
6. Choose the Knife Type
Select the knife type that most closely matches the previous choices. These are categorized by their best fit based on real-world applications. Of course, creative license can provide some wiggle room. I included axes and straight razors for reference, although those aren’t technically knives.
Ax/Hatchet
Appropriate tasks: attacking, dismemberment, intimidation, outdoor work
Intensity of use: very hard
Stealth offered: none
Skill level required: intermediate
Butcher Knife
Appropriate tasks: attacking, dismemberment, intimidation, mundane cutting jobs, self-defense
Intensity of use: somewhat hard to very hard
Stealth offered: none
Skill level required: beginner
Butterfly Knife
Appropriate tasks: attacking, intimidation, self-defense
Intensity of use: not hard
Stealth offered: a lot
Skill level required: expert
Fixed Blade Knife
Appropriate tasks: attacking, dismemberment, intimidation, mundane cutting jobs, outdoor work, self-defense
Intensity of use: very hard
Stealth offered: some
Skill level required: beginner
Folding Knife/Pocketknife
Appropriate tasks: attacking, intimidation, mundane cutting jobs, outdoor work, self-defense
Intensity of use: somewhat hard
Stealth offered: a lot
Skill level required: intermediate
Kitchen Knife (Excluding Butcher Knives)
Appropriate tasks: mundane cutting jobs, self-defense
Intensity of use: somewhat hard
Stealth offered: none
Skill level required: beginner
Machete
Appropriate tasks: attacking, dismemberment, intimidation, mundane cutting jobs, outdoor work, self-defense
Intensity of use: very hard
Stealth offered: none
Skill level required: expert
Straight Razor
Appropriate tasks: intimidation, mundane cutting jobs
Intensity of use: not hard
Stealth offered: a lot (they’re usually foldable)
Skill level required: beginner (for cutting other characters, not for shaving—that takes practice)
Switchblade/Automatic/Assisted Opening Knife
Appropriate tasks: attacking, intimidation, mundane cutting jobs, outdoor work, self-defense
Intensity of use: somewhat hard
Stealth offered: a lot
Skill level required: expert
Special note: Prior to the mid-1990s, assisted opening knives didn’t exist, so you must assign a switchblade for earlier occurring settings. Modern switchblades would be called automatic knives. See the section on knife laws in this book.
Throwing Knife
Appropriate tasks: attacking
Intensity of use: not hard
Stealth offered: none
Skill level required: expert
Example Scenarios
Example Scene 1: Garage Sale from Hell
The scene calls for a knife fight. Maynard Soloman is browsing a crowded garage sale. The cheap gumshoe can’t resist a bargain on golf pants.
Also at the garage sale is Bill Robber. He’s not there for the deals, though. He’s seeking revenge on Maynard for cracking the case that put him in prison for ten years. Bill’s plan is to quickly stab Maynard in the chest at the crowded garage sale, then use the confusion to make a clean getaway.
What would be the best knife for Bill to use? With the character’s role in the scene identified, the knife requirements break down like this:
Task: attacking
Intensity of use: not hard (the scene calls for a quick stab)
Stealth required: a lot (it’s a crowded garage sale and Bill wants to be sneaky)
Knife skill level: intermediate
Using that information, Bill’s options are a butterfly knife, a folding knife/pocketknife, and a switchblade/automatic/assisted opening knife. I’ll give Bill the butterfly knife, since they’re hard to use. I hope he cuts himself. Jerk.
A fixed blade knife kept in a concealed sheath almost made the cut. It might’ve worked, but the scene required too much stealth for Bill to risk it.
Example Scene 2: Outsourcing Crime
For this scene, Bill Robber realizes he could save time and money for his criminal activity by outsourcing the work. He hires an expert criminal named Mary Johnson to bust up—literally—a sidewalk vegetable stand in an urban area. Bill wants the stand’s owners to pay a protection fee for the privilege of selling sweet corn and tomatoes. He tells Mary to dismantle the stand in the cover of night.
What knives should Mary carry on her visit to the vegetable stand?
Task: mundane cutting jobs
How hard the knife will be used: very hard
Stealth required: some (this is an urban vegetable stand)
Knife skill level: expert
Mary’s knife options are limited to a fixed blade knife. An ax or hatchet is a close second, but neither of those can be concealed as they’re carried down the street. Of course, chopping up a vegetable stand in an urban area is a pretty obvious thing to begin with, but Bill isn’t the best criminal. As an expert, Mary would still be selective about the kind of knife she uses. It’ll come in handy when she turns on Bill after he “forgets” to pay her.
Example Scene 3: On Patrol
The final example scene isn’t as action oriented as the others. This time, police officer Penny Flyswatter wants a knife to have on her person for when she patrols criminal hot spots, such as garage sales and sidewalk vegetable stands.
What’s the best option for Penny?
Tasks: mundane cutting jobs, self-defense
How hard the knife will be used: somewhat hard
Stealth required: some (it would benefit Penny to have a concealable knife)
Knife skill level: expert
The field is wide open for Penny. Her choices include a fixed blade knife (with a well-placed sheath; see the section on sheaths in this book), a folding knife/pocketknife, and a switchblade/automatic/assisted opening knife. If a fixed blade knife is assigned, a well-placed sheath would also have to be written into the story. Those are covered in another section.
Because Penny is in law enforcement, I’ll give her the automatic knife. She can use it without restriction.
Take It One Step Further
Once an appropriate knife type is assigned to a character, you may decide that you are finished. But if you want a more in-depth depiction, you can take it one step further.
With the knife type in mind, choose a specific model using the listings in the Hit List section of this guide. A visit to a sporting goods store or online knife shop will also outline your options.
When choosing a knife model, take note of the weight, blade length, overall length, style, and history. Do those specs jive with the scene and character? Remember: Bigger isn’t always better. A manageable knife that suits the character is the best bet.
As noted at the beginning of this section, the knife type matters more than the specific model. In this way, knives differ from firearms. However, the world of knives is rich with variety and innovation. Dive as deeply as you like.
