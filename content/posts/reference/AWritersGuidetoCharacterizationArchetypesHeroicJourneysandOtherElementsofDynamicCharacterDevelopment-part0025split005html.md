A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
A successful outcome occurs when the hero is able to explore the big questions while keeping his foundation intact. He must also make a difference in his own life, in his own thinking and discovery and thus add color into his life, as well as unpredictability and adventure. Hopefully he changes in the lives of others for the better, as well as society as a whole.
