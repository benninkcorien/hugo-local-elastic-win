A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE MATRIARCH
   •  Loves to be with family, enjoys entertaining, committed to her marriage, dreams about her wedding day. If she isn’t married, she may run a business as if it were her family. A good example is Roseanne Conner in Roseanne.
   •  As a villain, the Matriarch becomes the Scorned Woman who is passive aggressive and needs to be in control.
