A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two are very much alike. Both are somewhat childlike in their approach to life. They both love to play and party and be taken cared of. The Maiden is just more youthful and innocent. She hasn’t been hurt as the Seductive Muse may have been, and she doesn’t have the experience the Seductive Muse has either.
The Maiden can easily adapt. If she faces a hardship, her eyes will be opened and she will grow instead of becoming jaded like the Seductive Muse may. She also likes being dependent on others. She doesn’t care about having the power to walk away; she doesn’t want to walk away. She may want to find true love while the Seductive Muse has been there, done that, and moved on.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Maiden to see love for what it is without an idealized fantasy. She can teach the Maiden to accept reality and to watch out for herself in romantic entanglements.
The Maiden can teach the Seductive Muse to be more trustful and optimistic.
