A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FEMALE MESSIAH AND THE MAIDEN
SPIRITUAL VS. EMOTIONAL
These two archetypes don’t clash but there’s not much love between them either. The Female Messiah is not someone the Maiden can rely on. The Female Messiah won’t have any vested interest in the Maiden one way or the other, an actuality which puzzles the Maiden, who is surrounded by people who try to befriend or control her.
The Maiden is put off by the Female Messiah’s intensity. The Female Messiah is willing to take things all the way—to the death if she has to, and that is too much reality for the Maiden, who is less serious about things.
The Female Messiah can teach the Maiden to have a goal and see it through. She can show her that she is a spiritual being having a human experience, rather than a human being having a spiritual experience.
The Maiden can help the Female Messiah in many ways because she can move in and out of places without people taking much notice in her. They see her as just a ‘harmless little girl.’
As you construct your scenes, you can use this information to bring out your character’s deep inner world.
