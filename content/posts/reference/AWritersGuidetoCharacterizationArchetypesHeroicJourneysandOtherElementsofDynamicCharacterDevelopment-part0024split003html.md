A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
WHY MIGHT YOUR HERO RESIST THIS LESSON?
It could be that the hero’s health or finances (or some other area of life) has been neglected and it’s becoming a huge problem. Perhaps the spouse or kids are going to leave because they cannot stand the pace of their father’s life, or vice versa. The hero may have many important balls in the air, and he simply can’t fathom taking a break: If the balls fall, someone else might step in and take his place.
Other characters would probably support the heroine in her learning of this lesson because they would like to see a change in their own lives. They would like to have more simplicity and fun in their lives—almost everybody would. When there’s a problem in our life, we often look to other people and situations and things as the source, but very often the trouble lies within. The heroine must look inside herself to find her heart-centered direction in life again, and supporting characters can help her do that. Perhaps she should quit her job as an accountant and open the bakery she always wanted to own.
