A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
In a successful resolution the hero will learn:
   •  How to have patience
   •  How to stop and understand when he is jumping into reactive mode and making assumptions
   •  How to deal with people in a more relaxed way
   •  To really see and listen to what’s happening around him
   •  To really think about what he is doing before he does it
   •  To look at long-term consequences of decisions and actions
A successful outcome will include the hero’s inner healing and a new ability to make a more balanced, grounded decision that will take him to his goal.
