A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE AMAZON
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings. The Amazon can help him with that if she’s willing to bother. She wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions—the Fool doesn’t care about finding a place of his own.
He may not know how to act around the Amazon. She may be tougher than he is, and this may make him feel like less of a man. Thus he may be short with her and uncooperative. He may see as too much of a challenge, or he may like the dominatrix type and seek her out. If she is very adventurous, they can get along well.
She has a hard time understanding his free spirit. She wonders how someone goes through life without making any plans at all. And why doesn’t he care about my causes?
He may see her as too serious. He’s not interested in fighting for a cause unless the task can be fun and adventurous—then he’ll enthusiastically join in. She may mistake his help for deep concern for the cause and think they are very much alike. This sets her up for disappointment when he tells her his true reasons for joining the cause. He may not know how to care for the feelings of others. His behavior is not necessarily malicious.
