A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE BEAR’S CHARACTER ARC
In your story, someone may be attacking the hero, or his loved ones, on a personal level, and the hero needs to show restraint. Your hero can learn the lesson of restraint if you put him in situations where he must exhibit patience. You can use a time element that works against him. The end goal seems far off, and it looks like the hero is going to mess everything up because he can’t take the time to think things through so that he can make the right decision or rest with an idea, project, or some kind of creative endeavor or business. Instead he feels the need to rush in and get things done, and doing so causes a lot of problems and conflict (which are good for the plot).
The hero is very intense and driven, almost to the point of focusing too much and in the wrong direction, simply because he didn’t take the time to figure out the following:
   •  What he wants to do
   •  What he’s really looking for
   •  What he really, really wants to achieve
Sometimes we’re made to wait. Sometimes we have to refuse to believe what we are told. Sometimes we have to take time to prepare ourselves for what is to come.
Maybe the hero wants to be on a soccer team but doesn’t make the cut. His only choice is to take the time to develop the necessary skills. He must train in order to become a better player. Getting on the team is his goal. It’s all about being patient and taking the time to see new options and opportunities.
It’s human nature to want to hurry up and get to ‘the end’ (I know a lot of my writer friends want to), and many people don’t care how they get there. They want things done so they can move on to the next thing. As a result, they shoot themselves in the foot because they’re not taking the time necessary to consider all of the available options and complete their task in a way that will bring them closer to their goal and help them out in other areas of life.
When you are making decisions—especially decisions made at the level a hero makes them—there are many things to consider, and this is where the conflict comes in this lesson.
   •  He is not hibernating.
   •  He is not taking his time.
   •  He is not finding patience.
   •  He is not finding different options and opportunities.
   •  Villainous characters may be trying to use his emotions against him.
He may possess intense power and energy, but he doesn’t need to be aggressive in applying it. He needs to see the value in what other people can contribute, and he needs to take the time to stop and look and see other ways of doing things in order to be successful.
Your plot must be somewhat complex so your heroine is forced to consider many options.
This lesson teaches the heroine how to slow down, how to go with what life is throwing at her, how not to jump to the wrong conclusions. Very often a person switches to autopilot, meaning she stops seeing things as they actually are. If she’s experienced certain difficulties in life and similar situations present themselves to her, she will go through the databank in her mind and apply what has happened in the past to what’s happening at present. Very often this is not a good thing. She ends up making assumptions, and she jumps to conclusions, and may go off in the wrong direction. By being in the reactive mind, she may ruin relationships. Reacting to events without thinking or seeing the bigger picture can result in a dire situation.
A character can move in the wrong directions and generally screw himself up on false assumptions and by not seeing a clear picture of what’s actually happening in front of him. He gets so involved in his own drama and process and pain that he may not consider that maybe, for example, his girlfriend is canceling on him not because she has found a new boyfriend but because she is sick or some type of tragedy has occurred.
He jumps to conclusions that she is with another man because of things that have happened in his past. This can happen in business too. For example, a prospective client saying no to the hero’s proposal makes the hero think his prices are too high. Actually the client is telling the truth when he says he needs to delay the project until funds are available. This is different from a misunderstanding; it’s the hero’s misinterpretation of a situation, or his rushing to make a decision just because he want to cross a task off his list.
