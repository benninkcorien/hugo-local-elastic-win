A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Braveheart
William Wallace teaches the Scots, oppressed by the English that if they fight back, then though they may die in battle they’ll never lose their freedom and dignity.
The Shawshank Redemption
Andy Dufresne is falsely imprisoned for life in the Shawshank Prison. Still, he finds freedom behind bars and helps others to become free in themselves.
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
The author, who believes altruism is incompatible with freedom, takes a controversial look at freedom. The world is crumbling under government interventions and regulations. The economy has ground to a halt. The “banker with a heart of gold” lent to borrowers on the basis of their need rather than their ability and went out of business.
