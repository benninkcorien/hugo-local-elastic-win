A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MYSTIC AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two archetypes can fair well if the Female Messiah is on a spiritual mission—but only if the Mystic is not jealous of the status bestowed upon the Female Messiah.
If the Female Messiah is on a political (or other) mission, the Mystic may lose interest and see it as a waste of time. She wants to stay clear of other people’s drama or karma. It’s all an illusion after all.
The Mystic can help the Female Messiah navigate the paranormal terrain, if her quest is spiritual, or the Mystic can help the Female Messiah hide out, if that is what she needs. The Mystic is highly skilled at evading others.
The Female Messiah can call into question all of the Mystic’s beliefs, setting her on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.
