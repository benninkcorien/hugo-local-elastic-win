EMOTION: DISGUST
EMOTION: DISGUST
Quote: “Changers are characters who alter in significant ways as a result of the events of your story. They learn something or grow into better or worse people, but by the end of the story they are not the same personalities they were in the beginning. Their change, in its various stages, is called the story’s emotional arc.” —author, Nancy Kress, “Write Great Fiction: Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint”
One way to add conflict to a story and provide a growth ARC is to have a character that is seeking the approval of a boss or a parent, but only receives disgusted condemnation. Or a character who is repulsed by another character’s actions or behavior in any given situation can add a level of depth to the scene if it is shown.
Disgust is a negative feeling of aversion or disapproval at someone or something. While feeling disgust, a character might notice an increase in heart rate, higher blood pressure, and a decrease in skin temperature. The saliva is overproduced, which could trigger the urge for a character to spit at the object or even at the person that they feel disgusted with.
Writers should avoid just stating that a character felt a sick feeling of revulsion (cliché), loathing, or nausea, and instead reveal that the character feels disgust by their facial expressions and reactions. And instead of using a cliché like, Ron looked at his son’s messy room and recoiled in disgust, I would describe the room with sensory details so that the readers can witness the revulsion for themselves.
Some physical signs of disgust might be:
Curl of upper lips
An open mouth, the tongue pushing slightly forward
Wrinkled nose
Narrowing eyes
Lip corners are drawn down and back
Rolling of eyes
Making guttural sounds like “ewww” or “ugh”
Shaking one’s head while muttering
Hands up, backing away with a fake shiver
Eyebrows pinched together
Recoiling away
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I thought what he was doing was disgusting.
DEEP POV: Shaking my head, I muttered, “That’s super gross.”
SHALLOW: Nathan was repulsed by the dead body.
DEEP POV: Nathan recoiled and wrinkled his nose when he saw the cadaver.
SHALLOW: I was sickened by the sight of rotting food.
DEEP POV: I covered my mouth and nose when I got a whiff of the rotting food in the sink.
SHALLOW: She wore an expression of contempt. (cliché)
DEEP POV: She scrunched her brows and tilted her head to the side.
SHALLOW: Ben looked contemptuous.
DEEP POV: Ben’s lips curled upward into a sneer.
SHALLOW: Lacy thought Jack was abhorrent.
DEEP POV: Lacy’s steely gaze bore into his face.
SHALLOW: I was repulsed by his actions.
DEEP POV: My mouth puckered. “Ewww! Don’t eat that worm.”
SHALLOW: Cami thought he was a crude man.
DEEP POV: Cami leaned back and rolled her eyes.
SHALLOW: I saw Cordelia give me a disgusted look because I was wearing my gym clothes.
DEEP POV: Cordelia lifted her nose in the air as if the sight of me in my gym clothes offended her.

I have included two lengthier examples of how a writer might show “disgust” rather than bluntly state it. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
“Are you really not going to finish eating your food?” Amelia looked at Madison with revulsion. “You are going to make yourself sick.”
Madison looked down at all the food that was on the table in front of her. There was still a big amount of fatty foods besides what she’d already consumed. “Can you put this food outside for me because I feel sick?” she asked.
Then Amelia noticed her stand up and head into the bathroom.
Amelia took the plates and deposited them into the trash can. She could hear Amelia being sick in the bathroom, the flush of the toilet, and then the sound of her rinsing out her mouth. She felt disgusted by her friend’s bad habit of forcing herself to vomit after a heavy meal.
DEEP POV:
“Really?” Amelia shook her dark head and flashed Madison a tight smile. “You’re going to scarf and barf again?”
Madison glanced at the pile of carbs still left on her plate. Her stomach pitched and bile rose in her throat. “Can you please dump this junk? I can’t stand to look at it.” Madison scooted back her chair, ran for the bathroom, and slammed the door behind her.
Amelia grabbed the plates and threw the leftovers in the trash. Through the bathroom door, violent retching, the slurping flush of the toilet, and then the gargling of mouthwash penetrated the wood.

Just keep in mind while you’re revising your manuscript that great storytelling should be a mix of both showing and telling.
