A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
Maybe the thing that is so supposedly different about the hero is really no problem at all. Characters around the heroine can say, “I just don’t get why that was a problem. Everybody is like that; everybody has that and there really is nothing different about you.” We often think we are the only one in the world who has a certain problem, only to discover the problem is quite common but we didn’t know it until others shared their stories.
You might incorporate a twist where the problem actually exists in the character’s mind. For instance, a character who keeps talking about having some really strange types of plastic surgery and the people around her don’t get it. It is almost as if the heroine has body dysmorphic disorder where she sees problems that don’t exist.
Your character may feel misunderstood because the rest of world thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. She looks at herself and sees these things that are wrong, and she doesn’t feel normal at all. She wants to change these things about herself in an effort to be normal, but because the problem doesn’t actually exist there is nothing to change. This could be something the character needs to learn.
On the flip side, you can have a character who relishes being different and will do anything to remain so. She wants to be special. She wants to feel that she’s better than everyone else. She doesn’t want to heal anything and may have an inflated ego.
