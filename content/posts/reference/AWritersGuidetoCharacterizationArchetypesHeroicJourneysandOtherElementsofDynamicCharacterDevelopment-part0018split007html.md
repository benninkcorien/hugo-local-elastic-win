A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can use symbols that portray:
   •  Accomplishing something
   •  Getting to the highest level
   •  Climbing a mountain
   •  Walking a straight path without being tempted into other things
   •  Being focused
   •  Working in harmony within a group
   •  Images of resurrection and rebirth
   •  Being true to oneself with joy and playfulness
The mood, tones, setting, and props can all promote a positive, open expanded feeling. They also might juxtapose such a feeling by promoting the opposite.
Images of teams are appropriate for this lesson. What group might your hero be a part of when he decides to pursue his natural talent and skill? Perhaps the team wears a uniform. You can use a lot of that imagery in setting and costuming.
