A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE NURTURER
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and LOVE AND BELONGING motivates the Nurturer. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, and if he tells her this outright, she will try to help him with it. She tries to help in every situation, but he may not know what he needs.
The Nurturer needs to let go of her attachment to others and find her own identity. This is not something the Businessman can help her with. He may provide the home base for her to work from, but he won’t want her to change. He wants his home to remain constant so he can focus on work.
He may exploit her need to help others by asking her to help people at work and to entertain his clients. He may feel a sense of pride about the work she does, and he may enjoy people at work talking about how wonderful she is. But he can’t fully understand what it is like to put others ahead of oneself. He puts the company first, but only to ensure his career.
The Nurturer will be happy if the Businessman’s job has something to do with helping others; for instance, if he works for a nonprofit organization or something similar. She may push his buttons if he’s materialistic and unsympathetic with others. In her mind, he better put a quarter into the homeless person’s paper cup when they walk down the city street, and he better be able to deal with her need to tend to others.
