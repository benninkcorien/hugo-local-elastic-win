A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE MATRIARCH
SPIRITUAL VS. PHYSICAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. These are not things the Matriarch can teach, as she expects her man to bring home friends he’s made at work. His friends are her friends.
She wants home base, and the Recluse probably is not the man to provide it for her. She loves to be in control and won’t be able to cope if he is so easygoing and flighty, as she may see him.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits her husband or family. With the Recluse, she will probably have so little to do that she will be forced to spend time with herself.
Deep down inside he knows she does a lot for him and he respects her. He just has a hard time getting the alone time he needs. She seems to always want his attention, always nagging him and ordering him around, as if every free moment must be spent performing her chores. Her marriage is important to her and she won’t give up easily but ‘home base,’ in whatever form, is her domain.
She tries to respect his space, usually unsuccessfully, and she knows he loves her but she may do better with a man who is more available than he is.
