A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE MAIDEN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
The Amazon and the Maiden make an amusing pair. The Amazon almost immediately feels responsible for the Maiden, and the Maiden is all too willing to let the Amazon provide for her. This doesn’t mean the Maiden will easily accept the Amazon’s meddling in her life or that the Amazon will be happy about having to provide for the Maiden.
The Amazon can teach the Maiden how to care for herself instead of relying on other people for her well-being. But this is a lesson that is hard to teach the Maiden.
The Maiden can teach the Amazon to accept help from others and to work well as a member of a team. The Maiden’s free spirit may also rub off in small ways on the Amazon.
