A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. The Seductive Muse can help him value himself as a man, but she may not be able to teach him responsibility. She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks, and the Woman’s Man can definitely give that to her. He can always see a woman’s inner beauty.
The Woman’s Man likes to be around people who are playful and enjoy life. But he loves to find women who are inhibited or structured, and teach these things to them. He loves a ‘project.’ The Seductive Muse is not a good candidate for this because she is already playful and creative. They can be great friends and lovers for a long time. She won’t need him the way the other archetypes may. She can stand on her own with men and is already in touch with her sexuality.
He feels like she understands him, like they operate on the same wavelength. He enjoys her creative bursts and may try to share in them. Just like her, he explores the physical senses and loves to dance. She’s fun and outgoing.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the Woman’s Man as a great friend and/or lover. He is fun and adventurous and she knows he won’t commit to her. This is fine. She sometimes has trouble committing to a relationship herself so she understands. She loves a take-charge kind of guy, and he’s too emotional and easygoing for that.
