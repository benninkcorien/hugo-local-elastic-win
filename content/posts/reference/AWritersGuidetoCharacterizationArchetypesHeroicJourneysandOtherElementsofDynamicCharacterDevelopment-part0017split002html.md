A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES:
ET
An alien, stranded on earth, befriends a group of kids who try to help him get home. ET is an innocent character that never lets go of his loving ways, no matter what the people on earth do to him. He is a bit jumpy and very aware of what is going on around him. He quickly develops a plan B to get home.
The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
Holden is afraid of growing up and would prefer to remain an innocent child. He flunks many classes at school. “They kicked me out. I wasn’t suppose to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself at all.” The novel deals with adolescent issues. Retaining one’s innocence is a major focus.
Citizen Kane
This story is about the loss of innocence. “Rosebud” is used to push the story forward and to impart the theme at the same time, for it represents this high-powered man’s life and is the word he utters at death when the story opens. Throughout the movie, we want to know what Rosebud refers to.
British Romantic Literature focuses heavily on innocence, employing the child and the savage as main characters. Innocence is seen as the way to spirituality.
