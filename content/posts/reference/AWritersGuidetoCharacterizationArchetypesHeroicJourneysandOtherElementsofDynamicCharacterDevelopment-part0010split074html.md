A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CINDERELLA
In the Cinderella romantic journey, the heroine falls in love with the hero first and she is left at his mercy, even if she is an Amazon at heart. Her actions are centered around him and whether or not he will save her. Very often these stories focus on the hero and how he’s feeling. Hamlet and Ophelia come to mind.
ROMANTIC THEMES:
RAGS TO RICHES: Getting your due against all obstacles. To go from a place of lack and dissatisfaction to a place of abundance and happiness. She’s earned it.
ROMANTIC RESCUE: Saving your partner from self-destruction, or needing to be saved or nursed back to health yourself. Love is lifesaving and life changing on a physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual level.
CINDERELLA ARCHETYPES: Nurturer, Maiden
PRINCE ARCHETYPES: Protector, Woman’s Man, King
Some variations on this story are Cinder-Helle by Barbara Walker and Tale of the Shoe by Emma Donoghue.
