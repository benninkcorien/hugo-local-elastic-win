A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. The Seductive Muse is also very physical and needs to learn self-control, so she’s not a great candidate to teach the Protector. She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks, but because the Protector is so physically oriented, he can’t help but notice her looks.
The Protector loves to be around people who are in touch with their bodies, especially a woman. He loves sports, martial arts, and anything kinesthetic.
He may see the Seductive Muse as a wonderful playmate and confidant. He feels like she understands him and like they operate on the same wavelength, but not when she goes into creative mode. He doesn’t pursue his creative side, though he might be good at creative ventures. Tapping into his creative side is too internal and mental for him. He’s fun and outdoorsy. She’s fun and outgoing.
She’s not inclined to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home, but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the Protector as fun and adventurous, but a little too intense for her taste. She knows he is not one to commit to, but she will enjoy his company all the same. She loves a take-charge kind of guy, and he can definitely take charge, except when it comes to his emotions.
