Forensics: A Guide for Writers
ABOUT THE AUTHOR 
D.P. Lyle, M.D. is the Macavity Award-winning and Edgar® Award-nominated author of the nonfiction books, Murder and Mayhem, Forensics for Dummies, and Forensics and Fiction, as well as the thrillers, Devil’s Playground and Double Blind.
He has worked as a story and technical consultant with many published authors and with the writers and producers of several popular television shows, including Law & Order, CSI: Miami, Diagnosis Murder, Monk, Judging Amy, Cold Case, Peacemakers, House, Medium, and 1-800-Missing.
Through his Web site, The Writers’ Medical and Forensics Lab (www.dplylemd.com), he works with writers and readers to enrich their understanding of complex medical and forensic issues in the stories they write and read.
He was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama, where his childhood interests revolved around football, baseball, and building rockets in his backyard. The latter pursuit was common in Huntsville during the 1950s and ’60s due to the nearby NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center.
After leaving Huntsville, he attended college and medical school, and served an internship at the University of Alabama; followed by a residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Texas at Houston; then a Fellowship in Cardiology at The Texas Heart Institute, also in Houston. For the past thirty years, he has practiced cardiology in Orange County, California.
