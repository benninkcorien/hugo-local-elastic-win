A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE MALE MESSIAH
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
Of these two archetypes, we can make the stretch and say they both work on a team for the greater good of the ‘mission,’ but that is where the similarities end. In the end the Male Messiah usually has to go it alone when the rest of the team cannot follow through.
Many times the Male Messiah is trying to break apart the companies and systems the Businessman holds dear. Or he is risking the entire goal of the Businessman to rescue someone. He can teach the Businessman that people and causes are more important than monetary success.
The Businessman can teach the Male Messiah to think things through clearly before he acts, thus preventing a lot of mistakes that would force the rest of his team to drop out.
