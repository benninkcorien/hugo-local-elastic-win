A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
A successful outcome occurs when the hero learns how to balance both sides and walk that middle ground to ensure he keeps his generosity, gentleness, and innocence intact. He is grounded and aware so he can stay protected and be present, and therefore handle anything that may come up. A lot of self-trust is involved in living this way. The character may face many tests.
