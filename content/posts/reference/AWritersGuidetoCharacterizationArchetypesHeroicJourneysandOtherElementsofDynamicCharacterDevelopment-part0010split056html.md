A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE MATRIARCH
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. These are not things she can teach him, although she sure won’t put up with outbursts for long.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits to her husband or family. The Artist may make her feel bad if she doesn’t have interests of her own. He wants a creative type of woman who will understand his interests.
She wants a nice home base, and he’s probably not the man to get it for her. He may not make enough money to support her and her dreams for a large family. Even if he does make enough money, he is probably too volatile a personality for her.
She loves to be in control and won’t be able to cope if he is so emotional and erratic. She needs more stability. She also wants his friends to be her friends, but she’ll have to take an interest in his creative pursuits if she wants to get to know his friends.
Deep down inside he knows she does a lot for him and he respects her. He just has a hard time dealing with her demands. “She’s stifling my creativity,” he thinks. To him she seems to always want his attention, always nagging him and ordering him around. Such annoyances can make it very difficult for him to work at home during the day if she’s a homemaker.
Her marriage is important to her, and she won’t give up easily, but ‘home base,’ in whatever form, is her domain. She tries to respect his space, usually unsuccessfully, and she knows he loves her, but she may do better with a man who is more available than he is.
