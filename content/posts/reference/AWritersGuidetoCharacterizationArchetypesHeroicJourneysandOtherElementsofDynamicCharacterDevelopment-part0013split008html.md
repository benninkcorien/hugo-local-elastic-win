A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
This universal lesson, which crosses all genders and cultures, allows for many twists. For instance, consider an area in the hero’s life where he does exhibit patience. It might be a quirky hobby such as building ships in a bottle. Such a deviation would make an interesting twist in his personality. It shows that he does have the skill to focus and take the necessary time to be precise and think ahead. It also hints that he potentially could turn his problems around. You might create an instance in which he has to make a really quick decision. He is the only person in the room who can make the decision, and he winds up saving the day.
These are just some of the ways you can use this lesson to add conflict and interesting facets to the hero in your story. As you can see, you can definitely make this lesson the main theme of your story.
