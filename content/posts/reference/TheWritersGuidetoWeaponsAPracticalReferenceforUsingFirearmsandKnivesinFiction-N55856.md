Firearm Safety, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Firearm Safety
Anytime you talk about firearms, the first thing that should come up is safety. Any firearm-toting character, good or bad, should be familiar with general safety principles. It’s surprising how often they’re not followed in fiction, especially by characters who enforce the law.
Please keep that finger off the trigger until you’re ready to shoot, unless the character’s disembodied hand is ready to blast its way out of a rectangle. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Keep the finger off the trigger unless prepared to fire. Sure, people could drive with two feet on the gas if they wanted to, but one split second of confusion can end in tragedy. That’s why red flags go up when characters, especially law enforcement types, put a finger on the trigger before bolting into a tense scene. However, if a firearm uses a safety (not all do; be sure to research the model), the character would disengage the safety if he thought firing a shot were probable. For example, a stranger walks into Maynard’s RV. Maynard would switch the safety off while determining if the stranger is a threat. But he still wouldn’t put his finger on the trigger until he was ready to shoot, since the stranger might just be there with a pizza delivery.
Be sure of the target and what lies beyond. You could also say that what goes up must come down. Projectiles from even the smallest firearm can travel miles. The character shooting is responsible for that shot the entire journey. Characters cracking off random shots are being reckless. And when law enforcement characters shoot at a fleeing vehicle, they’re just asking for collateral damage. Warning shots are another problem. If you shoot up, that bullet still has to land somewhere.
Never point the firearm at people or property the character is not willing to destroy. In other words, if a firearm is aimed or even briefly pointed at a character, that character better be someone the shooter is willing to kill. It follows that a character would never check to see if a firearm is loaded by looking down the barrel. Need a visual example of what not to do? Watch Ed Wood’s classically awful Plan 9 from Outer Space “movie” (that’s being generous). The characters aim handguns at each other and themselves with reckless abandon.
Treat every firearm as if it is loaded. Unless a character is reckless, he or she would use the same amount of caution with an unloaded firearm as with a loaded one.
Use two hands when possible. Accuracy, and therefore safety, is always compromised when only one hand is used to shoot. Even with small handguns, using two hands is the safest, most accurate way to shoot. Reckless characters, or writers going for flash, might not care. That’s okay, but it’s worth stating anyway.
