A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE KING
EMOTIONAL VS. MENTAL
This is another opposing match between two archetypes. The Woman’s Man cannot handle all the planning, rule making, and dictating the King does. He needs to flow with life, not struggle against it. Likewise the King does not approve of how the Woman’s Man chooses to live his life. He wonders why a man would have so many female friendships.
They agree that a man should have as many woman ‘friends’ as he wants; but the King sees these women as playthings and the Woman’s Man deeply respects them as friends and lovers (unless he’s a Seducer). The King will never leave his marriage, but the Woman’s Man will move on as soon as the playfulness has gone out of the relationship.
The Woman’s Man can teach the King that control over the events of life is only illusory. He can help him through a crisis.
The King can teach the Woman’s Man to be more assertive and in control of his life.
