A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
The hero may not fully jump into this new life and may wind up involved with alcohol or other vices that numb his boredom (he is not necessarily in pain). He needs to find something of greater purpose to pursue, something that will contribute to a feeling of being needed and valued. You can use symbols, subplots, subtexts, dialogue, and tone in ways that suggest mystery and questioning. In this case, darkness or the unknown, reflections, exploration, vibrancy, sensuality, and items that show the hero in the process of seeking are appropriate.
Be sure to include the details of where the character lives and how he dresses. Also, you must show him and his ability to attract the opposite sex into his life and find fulfillment in that vein. All of the ways his basic needs are taken care of, and that he is not lacking anything material, can be a big part of the setting, costuming, and props. The dialogue should be very profound in the places where he questions life.
