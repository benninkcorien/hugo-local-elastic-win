A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW DO OTHER CHARACTERS VIEW THIS LESSON?
Other characters are usually okay with what the hero is going through. It’s a change, but it’s a change that the hero wants to pursue. It may even happen without much drama. Sometimes a challenge sparks the events.
The lesson doesn’t inspire the people around the hero to take action, but it can bring up issues concerning their confidence in him. They might see it as just another silly thing that he is trying to do. They may not support him or fight him. They also may not be very confident in him or what he is trying to do. They may not see the outcome that he expects. They can’t see the bigger picture because they are not involved.
