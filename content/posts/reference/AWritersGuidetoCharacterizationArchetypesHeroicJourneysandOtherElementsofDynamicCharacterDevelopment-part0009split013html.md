A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE KING
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
These archetypes represent two strong controlled men, which is why they clash. The Protector fights for others and the King fights for his family or his ‘kingdom’ in whatever form it takes.
The King finds his power in directing and controlling the lives of his family, friends, or employees. He is the rock, always there when others need him—but at a price. No one can refuse his requests. The Protector is too independent for that. He will come and go as he pleases. He will protect the King one day and fight against him the next.
The Protector can make the King aware of his broader responsibility to all people in need. He can show the King that he is in a position of power and should use it wisely.
The King can teach the Protector how to organize a group and take control of his life and aspirations. He can help the Protector network and build connections.
