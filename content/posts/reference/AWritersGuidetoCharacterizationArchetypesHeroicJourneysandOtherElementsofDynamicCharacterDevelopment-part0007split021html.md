A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE NURTURER AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
These two archetypes may seem to have many similarities but in fact they are quite different. The Female Messiah will allow someone to be in pain if it is for that person’s greater good and growth. The Nurturer can’t watch a person suffer without trying to alleviate that suffering.
The Female Messiah can teach the Nurturer that perhaps she is giving too much because she seeks acceptance and self-esteem from those who need her. She can teach the Nurturer to look at the bigger picture.
The Nurturer can help the Female Messiah deal with people who want to cause her harm. Most people around the Nurturer ‘owe’ her for her help and would grant reprieve to the Female Messiah in her honor.
