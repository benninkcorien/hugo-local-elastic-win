A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Protector, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn self-control because he frequently flies off the handle, though not necessarily in a violent way. This may be something the Father’s Daughter is used to—she has been around stressed businessmen in meetings, etc.—so she may not be much help in teaching self-control. But the Protector also needs to learn how to use his mind instead of his brawn, and this is something the Father’s Daughter can help with.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. The Protector can help her with her inhibitions, and he can get her back into nature, but he can’t help her value herself as a woman. As he would say, ‘women need to be protected.’ This is not to say he doesn’t respect and admire women.
As a couple, they are not very comfortable around each other. He has a hard time understanding the intellectual jargon she uses and wonders if she is she trying to impress him or make him feel stupid. She can be a good balance for him, but they will have a tough time making things work if she’s too assertive. She’s attracted to powerful men, which he is, but he may not be mentally focused enough for her taste.
She likes being the only female in the group and feels she is the exception: “the Protector may need to protect other women but I can get along on my own.”
