A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FOOL AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
PHYSICAL VS. MENTAL
The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Fool, and The NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn to set limits on his behavior and consider other people’s feelings. These are things the Father’s Daughter can teach him because she works with others all the time.
She needs to get back to nature, which is something the Fool can help her with. She also needs to value herself as a woman. The Fool can help her see the big picture regarding cultural stereotypes (he’s antiestablishment), but he’s not necessarily a feminist.
Though they are both motivated by the need to know and understand, the Father’s Daughter approaches this need through books and the Fool through experience.
They are both very uncomfortable around each other. He knows nothing about the business world and doesn’t want to learn. He is against all structure and rules, and hates the fact that one has to toil away at a job just for a place to sleep at night.
She doesn’t understand his flighty, free-spirited nature. How can anyone live without knowing what the next day will bring? Her day planner is an all-important tool.
He is the biggest flirt that ever lived and she doesn’t know how to flirt at all. He may find her charming at first if they meet where he can be in his element, for instance a bar or nightclub.
