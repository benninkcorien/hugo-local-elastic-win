Knife Sharpening and Sheaths, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Knife Sharpening and Sheaths
Knife sharpening is an art form unto itself. It involves metallurgy, geometry, muscle memory, and an understanding of abrasives to get it right.
For fiction, knife sharpening doesn’t usually involve those things. Instead, it’s employed as a means of intimidation. There’s nothing wrong with that from an accuracy standpoint—characters can sharpen knives all they want—but here are a few basics to understand what’s actually happening.
Sharpening Is a Process
Sharpening a knife is kind of like sanding wood. A person would start with the coarsest-grit sandpaper and end with the finest.
The same goes for knives. Coarse materials, such as diamond-infused abrasives, remove metal until the outline of an edge is formed. Finer abrasives shape the edge. Strops, such as leather or cloth, hone the edge so the grains of metal stand up to form “teeth.” Each one of those steps is important in the sharpening process. Some passages in fiction go wrong simply by doing them out of order.
When characters sharpen knives for intimidation, it makes the most sense for them to hone the blade on a strop or exceptionally fine abrasive. Doing so refreshes the edge and prepares it for mayhem. However, sometimes in fiction, the character will use a coarse abrasive, such as a commercial knife sharpener or even a rock, just before slicing and dicing. All those drastic measures do is remove a perfectly good edge (unless the knife was unusably dull in the first place). The idea isn’t to replace an edge; it’s to maximize how well that edge performs. That’s what honing—such as stropping the blade on a piece of leather—does best.
If that’s confusing, think back to sanding wood. Let’s say guests are coming over in three minutes, and the wooden dining room table needs to look its best. Does it make sense to run coarse-grit sandpaper over the table right before they arrive? Or would it be better to hone out tiny slivers in the wood with a cloth?
The Crash Course in Knife Sharpening
Learning how to sharpen knives opens up an entirely new understanding of these seemingly simple objects.
For a crash course to try at home, get a permanent marker, a nonserrated knife, and a basic commercial sharpener (manual is best, not electric). Draw a line with the marker along either side of the blade’s edge. Now run a few strokes of the blade along the sharpener.
It’ll be easy to spot where the metal is coming off the edge, because the ink will be gone. The goal is to remove all of the ink, indicating the knife is sharp. Repeat the process from coarse grits on down.
Does this matter to writing a story? It might not, but it does offer a better understanding of knives and sharpening.
Sheath Materials: Steel Ain’t It
Unless a character literally possesses balls of steel, transporting a nonfolding knife also means carrying a sheath. That can be a pain to think about when writing, but it’s even more so for the character if a sheath isn’t present.
Sheaths can be made from just about anything. The only requirement is that the material used is softer than the blade. If it’s not, the sheath will dull the blade.
Wood, cloth, and leather have been popular sheath materials throughout history. Modern synthetic materials dominate sheaths today. Plastics, such as Kydex, are inexpensive, durable, and lightweight. Composite materials like Micarta blend cloth with synthetics, used for both sheaths and knife handles.
Where Sheaths Are Worn
The classic sheath worn on the belt, either vertically or horizontally, is a go-to choice. If need be, here are some other styles.
Inside-the-waistband (IWB) sheaths are a take on the traditional belt sheath. Like their handgun counterparts, the sheath slips between the pants and the leg or tucked shirt. This offers better concealment, especially when paired with a jacket or long shirt. Characters new to knives probably wouldn’t feel comfortable using an IWB sheath, though.
Neck sheaths are one of the most underappreciated in fiction. This is a sheath attached to a lanyard for wearing around the neck. It sounds dangerous on paper, but it’s actually one of the safest carries in reality—so long as the blade fits snugly in the sheath. Neck sheaths allow a knife to be carried under a shirt or jacket. Drawing is as easy as pulling down on the handle. It’s perfect for stealthy characters using small- to medium-sized knives. Keep in mind the lanyard will be exposed, though.
Larger knives will work with neck sheaths, but they might not be practical for a character. Go with a shoulder sheath instead. This type of sheath sports a harness that secures to the shoulder. The sheath itself is at chest level with the knife handle pointed down for an easy draw.
Shoulder sheaths aren’t appropriate for machetes, though. If wearing the machete on the belt isn’t an option, go for the back sheath. This type goes by many names, but they all function the same way. The sheath is designed to secure behind a shoulder blade. The machete is drawn up and away from the body from behind.
The sheath for this Spyderco Enuff Leaf sports lanyard holes for wearing around the neck. Its profile could also slip into a character’s footwear or other apparel. (Photo courtesy of BLADE.)
Boot sheaths are designed to slip inside footwear. Short and slender boot knives are ideal for use with these types of sheaths. Fiction likes a good boot knife, but the sheaths make walking or running awkward. The longer the knife, the more it will restrict a character’s movement.
Sheaths for the arms, legs, and chest are often used in tandem with MOLLE (modular lightweight load-carrying equipment) gear. MOLLE gear, a recent development, consists of a customizable harness used by military and law enforcement organizations for carrying tactical items, including sheaths. MOLLE systems are also available to civilians.
Where Sheaths Shouldn’t Be Worn
Characters with a lot of knife know-how might want to avoid placing a sheath on a belt behind the back . Drawing the knife from this position won’t be a problem. But what about putting it back? One miss in this blind spot and the character could pierce a kidney.
Sheaths for Folding Knives
Although they have their own sheaths built-in by design, folding knives can have exterior sheaths, too. These pouches are secured with Velcro, snaps, or other fasteners. Folding knives might also be outfitted with pocket clips.
That Special Sheath Sound
When drawing a knife (or sword), some stories will toss in a dramatic, metallic shink sound. That’s entirely the invention of fiction. In reality, the sound is much different.
First off, where is the noise of drawing the knife originating? It’s coming from the metal blade rubbing against the inside of the sheath, right? If the sheath is made from wood, cloth, leather, or synthetics, the sound produced wouldn’t be shink-y at all. It’d be more like someone unfurling a canvas or drawing a pair of scissors from a pocket.
In order to get that shink sound, the sheath would need to be made of metal. Listen closely to the next shink that pops up in a movie or TV show. It sounds a bit like two pieces of metal grinding together. That kind of metal-on-metal action is great for a monster truck rally but not for blade durability. The edge would become dull in no time. That’s a problem, and it’s why metal sheaths aren’t used for practical knives. (Ceremonial ones are another story.)
The point is that sheaths aren’t noisy. Avoid writing them like they’re party favors on New Year’s Eve.
Sheaths: The Original Bag of Tricks
Sheaths aren’t only for knives. People throughout history have doubled up on them, and the modern age is no exception. Feel free to write spare ammo, flashlights, a handgun, lighters, tools, and any other small item into knife sheaths.
One popular model from the past few years is the CRKT 2-Shot Skinner. Designed by Russ Kommer, it holds a proper fixed blade knife plus two shotgun shells. Why? Well, why not?
Fiction often forgets about sheaths as a source for emergency items. Don’t overlook them. They can be the perfect remedy for a character—or a writer—stuck in a rut.
