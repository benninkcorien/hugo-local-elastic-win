A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE RECLUSE AND THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER
SPIRITUAL VS. MENTAL
THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Recluse, and THE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND motivates the Father’s Daughter. He needs to learn how to relate to people and to reconnect with his body. These things are totally out of the Father’s Daughter’s league. The Recluse also needs to learn how to use his mind instead of his intuition/feelings all the time, however, and this is something the Father’s Daughter can help him with. Reason and logic are her forte.
She needs to learn to let go of her inhibitions, to get back to nature, and to value herself as a woman. The Recluse can help her get her back into nature and maybe even help her value her womanhood, as he is not strongly gender identified. He sees a person’s spirit, not his or her outward body. He can’t help her overcome her inhibitions, however.
The Father’s Daughter doesn’t have much time to explore the unknown as the Recluse does. She may not have the patience for it and may not respect his choice to spend his time on it. She’s used to office drama and business negotiations. She’s also used to more assertive men. She can either admire or disrespect the Recluse for his easygoing attitude.
He has a hard time understanding all of the intellectual jargon she uses and wonders if she is trying to impress him or make him feel stupid. If he really likes her, he may start reading books on the subjects that interest her so they can talk about them. If she really likes him, she’ll dabble in the unknown in an attempt to understand him better.
