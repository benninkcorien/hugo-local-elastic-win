A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE MYSTIC
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and the AESTHETIC NEED FOR BALANCE motivates the Mystic. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts. These are things the Mystic can teach him. She lives in a receptive state, allowing everything that comes into her life to teach her something.
She needs to learn to be assertive and to go out and experience life. He’s not one to experience much in life but he can teach her to be assertive. He’s very driven when it comes to his missions.
These two are very easygoing people. They both want to join in something greater than themselves, but the Mystic needs more balance in her life and she will want time to herself. Going out into the world can be scary for her, and this is where they don’t see eye to eye. She wouldn’t mind that he goes away often, however, because she likes being alone.
She may see changing herself for the better as doing her part since she’s setting the stage for others to heal themselves by example.
He needs to be more productive in his view, and he may not embrace her views.
