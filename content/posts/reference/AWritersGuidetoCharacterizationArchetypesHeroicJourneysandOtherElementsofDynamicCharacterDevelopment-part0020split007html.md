A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
For this lesson, it may be something as simple as a scene in a restaurant. Your character decides to order something not on the menu. Or the character’s significant other decides to order something not off the menu, and your character is alarmed: “What are you doing? You can’t do that!” Such an exchange shows him trying to control his girlfriend’s freedom and squashing her free spirit. Later he can encourage her by saying, “Whatever you get, I’ll get,” to show how he has changed.
There are different ways to explore the idea of free spiritedness. It’s not necessarily about hippies and free love. A free spirit can show up in the boardroom. It’s an inner way of thinking. It’s having spontaneity and seeing a curve when others see a straight line.
The dialogue can also be used to illustrate a lot about doing things differently or conversely of grasping, clawing, and obtaining. The lesson is about overcoming the desire to contain and control something.
