A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
AUDIENCE INTEREST
An audience might think it’s silly for the character to try to use intuition. They may expect the character to fail (unless your story is about psychics). The public doesn’t generally accept that all people have an innate ability to be intuitive. But attitudes are changing.
Innocence, living in the present moment, and being sensitive and observant are not valued ideals in American society. Yet, deep down, some of us wish we were these things. We want to keep our innocence and to have fun and not worry about safety or someone trying to take advantage of us. But we also see intuition as a gift only few can master. We want intuition to work for us, but we categorize it alongside magical power.
