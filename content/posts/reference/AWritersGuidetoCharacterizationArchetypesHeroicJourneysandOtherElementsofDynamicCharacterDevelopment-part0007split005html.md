A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE MYSTIC
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Seductive Muse loves to be out and about. Sitting still is not her cup of tea. The Mystic, on the other hand, loves to sit still and be alone with her thoughts. Put these two in a room together and the Mystic will find her patience tested by the Seductive Muse’s many questions, movements, and curiosities—that is, the things she tries to entertain herself with.
Sometimes the Mystic chooses to be celibate, a decision the Seductive Muse will never understand. Sex is so fun and enjoyable to her. Why would anyone volunteer to give it up? (She could never pass up chocolate either.) Why deny yourself?
The Mystic is very into her spiritual or paranormal experiences so this may be one area for them to engage in conversation. To experience other ‘dimensions’ of thought is a right-brain creative function.
The Seductive Muse can teach the Mystic that sexuality can be a spiritual act in and of itself, that the self does not have to be denied in order to experience the spiritual. She can teach the Mystic to smell the roses and laugh it up.
The Mystic can teach the Seductive Muse to calm down and become self-aware. If the Seductive Muse has experienced something painful in her past and is trying to keep it hidden, doing so may be difficult. She doesn’t want to analyze herself or her actions.
