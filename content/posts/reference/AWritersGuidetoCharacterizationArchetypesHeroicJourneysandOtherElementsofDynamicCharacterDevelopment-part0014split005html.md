A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION
In a successful resolution, the heroine will learn the lesson without having to go through too much pain or loneliness, without having to completely bottom out. That might be the ultimate version of success, but it wouldn’t be very dramatic. Instead, your heroine should hit bottom in some area of her life. Something significant should happen that provides a wake-up call and forces her to count her blessings. Then she can be successful in hearing that call.
