A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE EAGLE’S CHARACTER ARC
The degree to which the hero fails at love is the degree to which he is closed off. Sometimes when a person is closed off, he clings and acts needy. Such behavior reeks of desperation and ends up pushing others away. Then the hero may become angry and demanding. The hero needs to be clear about his motives for entering a relationship (with a person, group, or spiritual cause) and know what it is he truly desires. He needs to make sure he is ready to make such a connection, that “his feathers and talons” are ready for the deep relationship he seeks whether it’s in marriage, family, friendship, spirituality, or his career.
As the all-American hero: It’s as if everyone is in love with the hero. He can do no wrong. He is at the top of his game and has all of the skills and tools that he needs to accomplish his goals. He keeps his goal in sight and may not experience much of an arc because the lesson itself becomes a symbol. The arc is simply the hero maintaining this image and handling the responsibility of it, while sustaining the skills and the tools needed to accomplish the goal. The hero starts out with skills, knowledge, and resources already at his disposal—he just has to step up. He is the ideal that we all aspire to, and he is not allowed to have flaws or fail.
