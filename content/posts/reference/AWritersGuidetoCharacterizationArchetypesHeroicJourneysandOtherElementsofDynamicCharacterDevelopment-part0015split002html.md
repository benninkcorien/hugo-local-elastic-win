A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES:
Office Space
The hero decides he’s not going to be a corporate drone and stands up to the bosses (asserting himself), which winds up getting him a promotion. He decides he doesn’t want to work at all anymore and hatches a plan to steal money from the corporation.
Lord of the Flies by William Golding
Ralph pushed Piggy to one side. “I was chief, and you were going to do what I said.” Ralph learns to assert his power, but he does so for the sake of the signal fire and to help everyone get rescued. He sees power rightly used in the right time or the right reason.
The Matrix
Neo must learn to embrace his talents and skills, but they are of no use if he cannot assert his power and stand up for himself. He becomes not only the master of his life, but the master of the entire matrix. He develops a plan to save Morpheus and executes it against the advice of others.
