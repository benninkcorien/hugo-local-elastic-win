A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE KING
MENTAL VS. MENTAL
These two men understand each other. The King runs his businesses and/or family and friends using great organization and control, and that is something the Businessman respects. The King is more of a leader than the Businessman, who may be more of a follower.
The Businessman can teach the King how to play for the team instead of for himself.
The King can teach the Businessman how glorifying it is to be ‘on top,’ that is, as the boss. He may inspire the Businessman to achieve more, if doing so fits the Businessman’s personality.
