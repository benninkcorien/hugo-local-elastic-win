CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION
Quote: “The bestselling writers who endured fifty, or even a hundred rejections, before finally achieving success would make for such a long list of names that I would develop carpal tunnel syndrome just typing them all. Perseverance is as important as talent and craftsmanship.” —bestselling author, Dean Koontz
Now that you have a clearer idea on how to revise shallow scenes by using the Deep POV technique, search for telling sentences and revise them by applying this amazing tool, but please avoid using overworked clichés in your writing.
Although, most books will probably offer similar advice about the Deep POV method, you can still gain the balance of study, theory, and practice that you might need to fully grasp these wonderful skills through additional reading. If you’d like to discover even more ways to strength your prose, I suggest studying these amazing books by these talented writers.
