Handguns 101, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Handguns 101
Handguns are best applied at close ranges. They’re portable and powerful but lack accuracy due to their short barrels. It might be hard to believe, but it’s actually difficult to accurately shoot beyond 20 yards or so. Don’t believe me? Hit up a gun range and prepare to be humbled.
Many types of handguns are available, but a writer can’t go wrong outfitting a character with a .22, .25, .32, .38, 9mm, .40, 10mm, .357, .45, .44, or .50 (sorted from the least to most powerful caliber).
Pistols

Popular semi-automatic pistols: Beretta 92, Colt 1911, Glock 17, Springfield XD, Walther PPK
A pistol is a handgun that uses one or more stationary chambers (the spot inside a gun where a cartridge is seated to be fired). Pistols can be single-shot, semi-automatic, or fully automatic (a.k.a. machine pistols). Semi-automatics are the most popular pistols in thrillers and crime fiction, and for this reason this section focuses on semi-autos.
It’s important to understand that the word pistol is not synonymous with revolver, which is covered in a different section of this guide. This is one time to forgo the dictionary definition and go with modern usages to prevent confusing readers. If you need another word for pistol, use handgun.
Pistol ammunition is usually stored in a detachable magazine that slips in and out of the handle (grip). This is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a clip. In the vast majority of cases, the correct term is magazine. A clip bundles ammunition together for insertion into a magazine. A magazine holds ammunition and is either detachable or built into a firearm.
The operator of this pistol is working the slide-action. Pulling the slide back and letting go is called “racking the slide.” This loads the first round from the magazine into the chamber. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
A semi-automatic pistol’s action (the mechanism that cycles ammunition through a firearm) simultaneously ejects and reloads one shell after each shot. When writing, you’ll most likely want to use one of two semi-auto actions:
The slide-action pistol uses a sliding mechanism fitted over the barrel (to the untrained eye, it looks like the top half of the gun). It slides backward and forward as the pistol is fired, powered by the recoil of the shot being fired. After inserting the magazine, chambering the first shell involves pulling the slide back and releasing so it snaps forward. This is called “racking the slide.” After that shell is chambered, the operator can continuously fire without pausing. Most modern pistols, such as the ubiquitous-to-fiction Glock, use a slide-action, and most writers will opt for a slide-action for their characters’ semi-auto pistols.
Another type of semi-automatic pistol uses arms and levers instead of a slide-action: toggle-lock actions. This action is more common with older pistol models, such as the Luger.
Luger pistols are some of the most well-known toggle-lock pistols. The most notorious (but not exclusive) users of Lugers were the Nazis, fiction’s favorite bad guys. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Derringer is a generic term you’ll hear used for a small pistol. Derringers are ideal for characters who need a backup firearm, since they are easy to conceal. Spies or stealthy characters might also opt for a derringer. Just remember that the shorter the barrel, the harder it is to hit a target. Derringers don’t offer much for accuracy beyond a few yards.
The hammer on this single-action 1911 is cocked. That happens automatically as the operator racks the slide, which loads a cartridge into the chamber. It’ll happen again as a round is fired. There’s no need for a character to cock it manually for dramatic effect. To do so would require de-cocking the hammer after loading the gun, then re-cocking it for dramatic effect. If the hammer wasn’t cocked in the first place, why aim the gun at someone? (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Many thriller and crime fiction characters cock a pistol’s hammer back for dramatic effect. (I discuss this in greater detail in the Myths section.) While this is mechanically possible at times, it doesn’t make sense from a practical standpoint, especially with most modern handguns.
Advantages
Pistols are easy to conceal and transport.
Pistol magazines usually offer more shots than revolvers. Characters needing a handgun capable of firing many times would choose a pistol over a revolver.
Pistols with detachable magazines are quicker to reload than revolvers. Popping a magazine in and out takes only a couple of seconds.
Scores of pistol designs are available in a variety of calibers to suit any number of purposes.
Disadvantages
With semi-auto pistols, more moving parts equals more chances for something to go wrong, such as a shell becoming jammed in the chamber. Although pistols have come a long way in reliability, a revolver’s simpler operation is less prone to complications.
Handguns in general, and especially semi-automatic pistols, are subject to more restrictions than their long-barreled counterparts, making them more difficult to obtain legally.
It’s difficult to accurately fire any handgun, including pistols. The shorter the barrel, the less rifling (spin) the bullet receives as it exits the pistol. Less spin equals a less-stable trajectory and reduced accuracy. Extensive training and practice is necessary to accurately shoot any handgun even at close ranges.
Semi-automatic pistols have a steeper learning curve compared to relatively simple revolvers. Characters unfamiliar with them won’t necessarily figure out how to use one.
Reloading a pistol with a fresh magazine is one thing. Reloading the magazine is a different animal. Shells must be fed into the magazine one at a time. This can take a minute or more. A character in a tight spot better have preloaded magazines ready to go in a firefight.
Inaccurate Example
“You’re going to tell me what I need to know right now,” said Bill Robber. He popped a fresh clip into the business end of his Glock and took aim at Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective.
“When you get to be my age, hindsight is fifty-fifty,” said Maynard into the pistol barrel only inches away. “I have no idea where you lost your keys.”
Bill cocked the hammer on the Glock.
“I saw you go through my dirty clothes at the Laundromat,” he said.
“I was searching for evidence. And loose change. But I didn’t take your gal-damn keys, you ditch-diggin’ Neanderthal,” Maynard said.
Bill switched the pistol’s safety off with his thumb.
“This is your last chance before I blow your brains out,” Bill said.
Accurate Example
“You’re going to tell me what I need to know right now,” said Bill Robber. He popped a fresh magazine into the grip of his Glock and took aim at Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective.
“When you get to be my age, hindsight is fifty-fifty,” said Maynard into the pistol barrel only inches away. “I have no idea where you lost your keys.”
Bill racked the slide on the Glock.
“I saw you go through my dirty clothes at the Laundromat,” he said.
“I was searching for evidence. And loose change. But I didn’t take your gal-damn keys, you ditch-diggin’ Neanderthal,” Maynard said.
Bill pressed the barrel into Maynard’s nostril, indenting the detective’s cauliflower nose.
“This is your last chance before I blow your brains out,” Bill said.
What Went Wrong?
Let’s go through this one chronologically. Bill popped a “fresh clip” into the Glock in the inaccurate example. Semi-automatic pistols use detachable magazines, not clips. He also inserted the clip into the “business end” of the pistol. That’s a slang term for barrel. Bill should stick the magazine into the handle (a.k.a. grip) instead.
Some pistols have external hammers that a shooter would cock, but Glocks do not. They also don’t have safety switches. A bit of research ahead of time would’ve taken care of those errors.
Also, Glock is sometimes used as a generic term to describe any modern semi-automatic pistol. Don’t do that. Glock is a specific brand that offers unique pistols.
Bill’s process of loading the Glock in the corrected version is a great example of how to get most semi-automatic pistols ready. Pop a magazine in and rack the slide, then pull the trigger when ready to shoot.
But I think the real lesson here is to stay close to your laundry at a Laundromat. Otherwise a cheapskate private detective might help himself to it.
Revolvers

A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder with multiple chambers that rotates as the firearm is fired—picture the classic cowboy handgun. Pulling the trigger or cocking the hammer rotates the cylinder. Unlike pistols, revolvers don’t eject their shells automatically after firing. They remain in their chambers until they’re removed manually by the shooter. That can be helpful for characters not wanting to leave empty casings behind.
Whereas many pistols use safeties, it’s less common for a revolver to have one. A character likely wouldn’t switch the safety off a revolver before firing.
The swing-out cylinder is the most popular type of revolver. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
There are three styles of cylinders (actually four if you count a few old revolvers, but those aren’t used very often, so they won’t be covered here).
The first is the iconic swing-out cylinder. The cylinder swings out from the revolver to the side to be loaded or unloaded. This is what most modern revolvers use. It’s the one most people picture when imagining revolvers.
Top-break cylinder revolvers crack open forward for loading and reloading. Unless there’s a reason to use one specifically, it’s probably easier to write in the common swing-out cylinder revolver instead. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
The top-break cylinder revolver opens forward and down on a hinge to load or unload the chambers. It’s not as common as the swing-out style, although it’s been around since the 1870s or so.
Finally, the cylinder on a fixed-cylinder revolver doesn’t move away from the handgun at all. Instead, ammunition is loaded and unloaded via exposed chambers accessible along the side of the revolver. This is most common with much older revolvers.
If in doubt about what kind of cylinder a revolver is using, write around anything related to it. Stating exactly how a shooter reloads a revolver is not as important as keeping a consistent shot count (don’t have eight shots come from a six-shooter). Chances are good, though, that most writers will use swing-out cylinder revolvers.
Speed loaders remain the most popular tool in fiction—and in reality—to quickly load a revolver. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Revolvers do not use or contain magazines for loading ammunition. Cartridges can be inserted into their chambers one at a time by hand, dropped into place all at once with a speed loader (a device that drops shells into all empty chambers of a revolver at once), thumbed in with a speed strip (a flexible strip that drops shells into the chambers two or three at a time), or placed in with a moon clip (similar to a speed loader, except it’s a frame that holds the shells together and drops with the cartridges into the chambers).
Moon clips are similar to speed loaders and are often overlooked when writing revolvers. These thin frames hold cartridges together for quick loading. Be sure to write moon clip when referencing them. If you write clip, readers will wonder if you meant magazine, which revolvers don’t use. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Unloading revolvers involves exposing the chambers and manually removing the shells. This can be done with fingers, gravity (tip the revolver so the shells fall out), or an ejector.
The most iconic image of a revolver is that of the cowboy and the “six-shooter.” Yes, revolvers often come with six chambers, but there are many variations. These include five, seven, eight, and more. In other words, don’t assume that all revolvers fire six times.
If the hammer (a metal tab above the grip) must be cocked prior to firing each shell, the revolver is single-action. Single-action revolvers are more common with older models (such as most Old West revolvers). Most modern revolvers are double-action. The hammer can be cocked before pulling the trigger, but it isn’t required. Just pulling the trigger is enough. Some revolvers don’t even have a hammer. Those are called hammerless revolvers.
On the topic of hammers, let’s jump back to dramatic cocking again, which is the act of working a firearm’s action purely for effect or posturing. Of all the firearm types, revolvers stand the best chance of getting away with dramatic cocking. Still, there is no practical purpose for a revolver to be cocked for dramatic effect. The gun is already aimed at someone. Why isn’t it ready to fire in the first place?
With double-action revolvers, there is at least one practical reason to cock the hammer first, even though it’s not required: to make a steadier, more controlled shot. Cocking the hammer in this way makes it easier to pull the trigger, which is usually set to a high level of resistance.
Advantages
Because of their simple design, revolvers are considered more reliable than their pistol counterparts. Reliability is the number-one advantage of using a revolver over an automatic pistol.
Revolvers offer a mild learning curve. A character could learn how to operate one in no time.
Pistols might be quicker to reload than revolvers but only if the detachable magazine is already loaded with ammunition. Loading up one of these magazines takes considerable time. Revolvers don’t use magazines. A character with a revolver wouldn’t worry about blowing through preloaded magazines.
Revolvers are easy to conceal and transport.
Given their lengthy history, a revolver isn’t out of place in settings from the mid-1800s through today. Revolvers can be the default for a character when the writer isn’t clear whether semi-automatic pistols would be available in that setting.
Disadvantages
Compared to pistols, revolvers don’t offer much ammunition capacity. Characters might choose a pistol with a generous magazine over a revolver for an intense firefight.
Revolvers tend to be bulkier than their sleek pistol counterparts. They can bulge out from clothing when concealed.
Even with speed loaders, revolvers usually take a longer time to reload than pistols using detachable magazines. The difference is only a matter of seconds, but it’s worth considering for fight scenes.
Handguns in general are subject to more restrictions than their long-barreled counterparts, making them more difficult to obtain. Revolvers are usually subject to fewer regulations than semi-automatic pistols.
As with any handgun, it takes extensive training and practice to shoot accurately with a revolver.
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman whipped the revolver out of its holster. Taking aim with his six-shooter, he shot out each of the windows of Bill Robber’s dilapidated shack in the woods. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.
“Got your attention yet, Bill?” Maynard said. He fired another warning shot for good measure. “I’m here to take you to the hoosegow. Your little Nigerian princess Internet scheme is finished.”
Bill stumbled out the front door of the shack with his hands in the air. Maynard instinctively planted his pistol’s scope on Bill’s chest.
“Okay, you caught me, Maynard. But before you haul me off, I should probably give back all the money I swindled,” Bill said.
“Nice to see you’ve had a change of heart,” Maynard said. He lowered the revolver and flicked the safety back on. “Where’s the loot?”
“It’s in a bank not far from here. I just need some money to help get it out,” Bill said.
Maynard pulled out a wad of cash. “Great. Is this enough?”

Bill stumbled out the front door of the shack with his hands in the air. Maynard instinctively planted his revolver’s sights on Bill’s chest.
“Okay, you caught me, Maynard. But before you haul me off, I should probably give back all the money I swindled,” Bill said.
“Nice to see you’ve had a change of heart,” Maynard said. He holstered the revolver. “Where’s the loot?”
“It’s in a bank not far from here. I just need some money to help get it out,” Bill said.
Maynard pulled out a wad of cash. “Great. Is this enough?”
What Went Wrong?
Not every revolver fires six shots, but this example pegs the gun as a “six-shooter.” That means Maynard couldn’t fire seven times (six for the windows, one for the warning shot) in the inaccurate example. Keep the shot count consistent. That goes for any firearm.
As the Myths section of this guide explains, warning shots aren’t a good idea from a legal standpoint—you never want to be the first to pull the trigger unless it’s to stop a threat. Writers playing things closer to reality should keep that in mind. In this case, Maynard isn’t the brightest bulb, so the warning shot matches his character.
The inaccurate example uses revolver and pistol interchangeably. A dictionary might say this is correct based on historical usage, but I say this only confuses the reader, since the modern usage of those words splits them into separate categories. Walk into any gun shop and ask to see a pistol. You’ll never be shown a revolver.
It’s possible to mount a scope on a revolver, but it can look amateurish to feature one unless there’s good reason. Stick to using sights, which are built into the revolver instead. Scopes and sights are covered in their own section.
