Marine
United Nations, New York City, September 11th, 2008
RESOLUTION 1446
The Security Council,
Grieved by the death of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Brunei, under unexplained circumstances,
Deeply concerned that the annexation of Brunei by the Federation of Malaysia is being implemented without regard to the freely expressed desires of the Bruneian people,
Alarmed by recent naval incidents in the South China Sea involving armed clashes between forces of the Federation of Malaysia and the United States of America,
Acting under Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter of the United Nations,
Demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Malaysian military forces from the territory of Brunei,
Calls upon the Federation of Malaysia, the United States of America, the Sultanate of Brunei, member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and all other concerned States to begin intensive negotiations for the peaceful resolution of their differences,
Decides to meet again as necessary to consider further steps to ensure compliance with this resolution.
The resolution carried, with fourteen for, one against (Indonesia), and two abstentions (China, Japan). If China had vetoed the resolution, Malaysia's annexation of Brunei would have been a done deal, and the fragile "New World Order" could like it or lump it. Diplomatic pressure cut no mustard with the Chinese Communists. But in the days before the vote, chief executives of the major Western and Japanese banks and oil companies had called their Chinese contacts with a simple, back-channel message. If the takeover of Brunei went unchallenged, there would be no credits for any offshore oil development in the South China Sea, regardless of territorial claims by any power in the region. The Communist Chinese may have been true believers in Marxism-Leninism, but they weren't stupid.
