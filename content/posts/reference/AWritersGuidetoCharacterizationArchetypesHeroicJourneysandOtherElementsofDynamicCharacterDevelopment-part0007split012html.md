A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Amazon understands having a cause or mission like the Female Messiah does. This is where they see eye to eye. The Amazon can’t understand how the Female Messiah sometimes allows others to harm her instead of fighting back.
The Female Messiah can teach the Amazon to temper her emotions and to see the bigger picture. But this probably won’t stop the Amazon from fighting back.
The Amazon can teach the Female Messiah to be careful not to get into a situation that forces her to make the decision whether to fight back or not to begin with.
