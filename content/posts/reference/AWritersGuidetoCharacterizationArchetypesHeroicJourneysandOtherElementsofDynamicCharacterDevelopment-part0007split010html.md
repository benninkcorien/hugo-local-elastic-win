A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE AMAZON AND THE MATRIARCH
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
These two types of women have strong opinions, which may be what makes them clash. The Amazon fights for all womankind and the Matriarch fights for her family.
The Matriarch finds her power through directing and supporting the lives of her family, friends, or employees. She is the rock, always there when others need her. At the same time, she expects everyone else to be there for her when she needs them. The Amazon is too independent for that. She will come and go as she pleases.
The Amazon can teach the Matriarch to value her womanliness and thus how to run things from a woman’s perspective, rather than from the perspective her father may have taught her to run things.
The Matriarch can teach the Amazon how to organize a group and deal with people who look up to her.
