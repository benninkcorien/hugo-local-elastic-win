HUMBLE REQUEST
HUMBLE REQUEST
If you read this handbook and find the tools and tips helpful to improving your own storytelling abilities, please consider posting an honest review online.
Word of mouth is crucial for any author’s success, and reviews help to spread the book love. So please consider leaving a short (a sentence or two is fine!) review wherever you purchased this copy and/or on Good-reads.
If I get enough reviews stating that this guide helped writers to hone their craft, then I’d love to include additional books in this Deep POV series with new topics, such as romance writing, creating suspense, and fictional world-building.
And please visit my blog, “Fiction Writing Tools,” for tons of helpful advice on book promotion, author branding, and self-editing.
