A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE FATHER’S DAUGHTER AND THE MATRIARCH
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
These two women understand each other a little bit better. The Matriarch runs her family and friends as if she were running a company, a philosophy that the Father’s Daughter can respect. Her boss may even be a Matriarch.
The Father’s Daughter can teach the Matriarch how to play for the team instead of playing for herself and her wants.
The Matriarch can teach the Father’s Daughter how nice it is to be the boss. She may inspire the Father’s Daughter to achieve even more.
