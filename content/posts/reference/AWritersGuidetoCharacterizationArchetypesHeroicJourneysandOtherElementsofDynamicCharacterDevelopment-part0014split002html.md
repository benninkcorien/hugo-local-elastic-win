A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Eat, Pray, Love
After her divorce, the Julia Roberts character embarks on a spiritual journey of indulgence (Italy), prayer (India), and balance (Bali), and she learns to receive abundance and be grateful for what she has.
The Pursuit of Happyness
This is the true-life story of a single dad who tries to build a better life for him and his son. His son must trust him along the way, and the hero shows gratitude every step of the way. “I’m grateful for the chance,” he says. Nothing stands in his way as an obstacle. Since the story plays out as a flashback, we know the hero is successful in the end, but we still want to see how he did it.
It’s a Wonderful Life
George Bailey recognizes his life as wonderful, only after suffering many hardships, and learning the value of trusting and helping others. People do come to help him when he needs them.
The Blind Side
Everyone is grateful in this true story of a wealthy woman who mentors a homeless boy.
