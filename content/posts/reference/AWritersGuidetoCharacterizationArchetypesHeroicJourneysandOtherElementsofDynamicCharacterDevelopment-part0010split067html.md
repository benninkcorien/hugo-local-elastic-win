A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE MAIDEN
MENTAL VS. EMOTIONAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and SAFETY AND SECURITY motivate the Maiden. He needs to feel vulnerable to change and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. She can help him relax and see the beauty in the world, but her naive nature will only bring out the King in him full force. She is his responsibility and under his control.
She is very spontaneous and adventurous at times, and can show him a great time if they travel. He may not be too demanding with her at first, she’s so easygoing and innocent, and she won’t challenge him outright. He tries to protect her from the harshness of life.
She needs to stand on her own two feet. The King wants to take care of her and isn’t quick to teach her self-reliance. He can feel young again around her and enjoys showing her off. She is his possession, and he doesn’t think she can live without him. She’s more resourceful than he thinks.
She looks up to him. He is the rock in her life and her personal defender. They clash if he lets his guard down and isn’t there for her when she needs him.
After a while, his demands may change her. She may become harsh or jaded, and if so, he will wonder where the sweet woman went. Eventually she will learn to stand up to him.
