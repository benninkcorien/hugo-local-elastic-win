A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE BUSINESSMAN AND THE MATRIARCH
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM motivates the Businessman, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn to let go of his inhibitions, but he will not be able to do so in a life with the Matriarch—she loves to be in control and prefers him to be inhibited because then she can step up to the plate.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits her husband or family. With the Businessman she will concern herself with playing the perfect wife and entertaining his clients and co-workers in their home. She will take care of everything. In this way he may take her for granted, but not for long. If he doesn’t realize his error soon enough, she will stand up for herself.
The Businessman may not respect the Matriarch’s choice to become a homemaker because to him career is the most important thing and taking care of the home is not a career.
The Matriarch respects what he does, but she feels her job is much more important. She shapes the lives of her family, and as such she believes that he couldn’t be where he is without her.
If they aren’t married, these two characters will see each other as safe bets for a long-term relationship when they meet.
