A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
You can make your story more interesting by adding some twists to this lesson. You might include in your plotline a person who has absolutely nothing and yet is happy and grateful to be alive. Another idea is to include a character who is very wealthy and also very grateful, respectful, and happy giving much of her money away. She gives to charities and then visits those organizations and sees what good her money has done. She feels blessed to be able to help these people. Play with this idea and see where it takes you.
