A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CINDERELLA: THE HERO HOLDS THE POWER.
“Rags to Riches” and “Romantic Rescue”
Unlike the two story models that follow this one, Cinderella gives full power to the hero as he rescues the heroine and changes her life.
   •  The Prince is going to throw a ball; it’s time for him to find a wife.
   •  Cinderella is in a bad state of affairs. Her parents have died and she has no one to look after her except her nasty stepmother.
   •  Everyone but Cinderella is going to the ball. She has nothing to wear.
   •  A fairy helps her go to the ball, allowing Cinderella’s outer beauty as well as inner beauty to shine forth.
   •  She goes to the ball and meets the Prince but has to leave at midnight or her whole world will fall apart. The Prince falls in love with her the moment he sees her.
   •  The Prince decides that Cinderella is the one for him and he stops at nothing to find her.
   •  The Prince finally finds her, proposes marriage, and changes her life. He will care for her now. He has saved her from her mean stepmother and sisters. He will teach her what a real family is all about.
Cinderella is an innocent heroine who has all the qualities the hero thought he’d never find in one woman. She is set apart from all the other women in the land. She is a special girl who needs to be schooled in the arts of love, and the hero is the only man who is up to the job.
She goes out and meets the hero but doesn’t expect much to happen. She runs away from him, and he enjoys the chase, determined to have her whether she wants him or not. She is often much younger than her pursuer and more inexperienced. She grows and blossoms because of his influence and help. He saves her. Often these stories are written from the hero’s perspective.
This story focuses on the hero falling in love with the heroine, since she’s in love with him from the start.
