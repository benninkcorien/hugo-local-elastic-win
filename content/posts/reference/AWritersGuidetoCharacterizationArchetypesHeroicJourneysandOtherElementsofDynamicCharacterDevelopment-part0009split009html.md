A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE FOOL
PHYSICAL VS. PHYSICAL
The Protector and the Fool make an amusing pair. The Protector almost immediately feels responsible for the Fool, and the Fool is all too willing to let the Protector provide for him. This doesn’t mean the Fool will easily accept the Protector meddling in his life or that the Protector will be happy about having to provide for the Fool.
The Protector can teach the Fool how to take care of himself instead of relying on other people for his well-being. This is a lesson that is hard to teach the Fool, who thinks he’s fine just the way he is.
The Fool can teach the Protector to accept help from others and to work as a member of a team. His free spirit may also rub off in small ways on the Protector. He can also teach the Protector to walk away from a fight or to diffuse intense situations so the Protector won’t have to fight.
