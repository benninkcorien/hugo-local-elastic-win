SHALLOW: THOUGHTFUL
SHALLOW: THOUGHTFUL
Quote: “Complexity is an indispensable ingredient of life, and so it ought to be with the characters we create in our stories. Paradoxes do not negate the consistencies, they simply add to them. Characters are more interesting if they are made up of mixed stuff, if they have warring elements.” —author, Stavros Halvatzis
Just stating that a character looked thoughtful or was contemplative seems unoriginal and boring in my humble opinion. Books need some conflict or tension within the storyline, or a reader might put down the book and never pick it up again. If a writer states an expression or feeling or mode of thought, then it is telling—and too much telling is tedious to read.
A thoughtful character might be considered an intelligent person, who weighs the pros and cons before making any rash decisions. Or a tense character who likes to overanalyze events within the narrative could be depicted as brooding or pensive.
When someone looks thoughtful, the face is usually relatively neutral, although there can be a hint of a frown that tends to suggest concentration. The eyes are fixed on a wall, or staring off, and the lips are taut. If the person has a trace of a smile or he/she occasionally nods their head, this would indicate listening with interest.
One way to stay in close-and-personal (and there are many!) is to try to reduce as many filtering references as you can from your writing. Examples of shallow words are: brooding, pensive, contemplative, reflective, introspective, wistful, deep in thought, comprehending, quizzical, curious, inquiring, puzzled, perplexed, confused, etc.
Signs of thoughtfulness might be:
Unblinking eyes
Chewing lower lip
Staring into space
Quiet, not talking
Running hand through hair
Drumming fingers
Rubbing back of the neck
Tapping a foot
Furrowing brow
Eyebrows slanted or slightly raised
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I was thoughtful as I contemplated with curiosity, then I asked what happened next.
DEEP POV: With my elbow on the table, I made a fist and rested my cheek on it. “Then what happened?”
SHALLOW: Lauren considered the situation thoughtfully. “So really?”
DEEP POV: Lauren tugged on her earlobes. “That really happened?”
SHALLOW: I was pensive while I reflected on my options.
DEEP POV: I stared down at my hands while trying to decide what to do next.
SHALLOW: She comprehended the problem, and then she said thoughtfully, “That is interesting.”
DEEP POV: She posed a finger under her chin. “Hmmm, interesting.”
SHALLOW: I felt confused and I was struggling over the dilemma.
DEEP POV: I laced my fingers under my chin and frowned. There had to be a solution!
SHALLOW: Giles felt puzzled and confused. “I do not understand.”
DEEP POV: Giles pinched the bridge of his nose. “I am quite flummoxed.”
SHALLOW: I felt perplexed. “Are you sure it was a UFO?” I asked quizzically.
DEEP POV: I paced the room with my hands behind my back. “You sure it was a real UFO?”
SHALLOW: Thomas looked wistful. (cliché)
DEEP POV: Thomas fingered his jowl, and then said, “I’ve got it!”
SHALLOW: I was introspective about the movie.
DEEP POV: I scratched my head still unsure that I enjoyed the film.
SHALLOW: He looked deep in thought. (Cliché)
DEEP POV: He rubbed his baldhead. “You’re not making this easy.”
Next, I have provided two longer scenes of Deep POV vs. shallower writing. (I have underlined what I consider to be to be shallower writing in the first example.)
Please carefully examine these two examples…
SHALLOW: 
There was three girls sitting in the high school cafeteria, and they were discussing the upcoming funeral and the party planned for afterwards.
The cafeteria looked really big and the girls heard lots of loud sounds. There were gross smells, too. The girls looked thoughtful while they considered what to do about the party. The three girls had heard that Nicki Button had been stabbed that morning and she would no longer be attending school, because she was no longer alive.
“We just need to pick out the invitations, thank you gifts, and alcohol for the party,” Bonnie said thoughtfully. “But I don’t know—do you two girls think an iPod, a black T-shirt, and Gloria Vanderbilt perfume is too boring?” she asked nervously.
“I think it is perfect,” Charlotte said excitedly. “I mean, think how cool it is to have the newest technology, plus black clothing to wear, and a new fragrance?”
Bonnie nodded contemplatively. “Completely,” she agreed seriously. “Plus, black doesn’t show stains.”
Which was good when there was a stain of blood on your clothes from killing someone, Bonnie thought.
“Hey, what about my idea?” Kathy inquired, looking upset. “I said we needed to have some chocolate, too!”
“That’s too expensive to add now,” Charlotte argued soberly.
“And too much work to do that.” Bonnie sighed broodingly.
She did not really care about the party stuff. She knew she had a knife with blood on it to hide before her next class, she thought.
Kathy and Charlotte watched Bonnie lift her purse, open it up, and then take out a lipstick from her bag. She began to put it onto her lips.
“Where did you get that lipstick? Is that Nicki’s?” Kathy asked with surprise.
Bonnie appeared indifferent. “I took it because she cannot use it now that she is dead,” she said thoughtfully.
Did you see how bland and flat the writing was in the first scene?
It is boring for readers to be “told” what each character is thinking or feeling; and all those dialogue tags with emotional qualifiers are like red flags that the writing needs further revision.
Please study this revised version with “voice” and sensory details.
DEEP POV:
Three girls sat in the high school cafeteria, discussing the upcoming funeral after-party. The chatter around them seemed almost deafening. A fellow classmate Emily Emerson had been stabbed that morning, and the school was buzzing with murderous gossip. The stench of greasy food hung heavily in the air, making Bonnie wrinkle her nose.
She hated hamburger Thursdays.
“I can’t believe Emily’s dead!” Kathy was sniffling and dapping at her teary eyes with a napkin.
“Believe it,” Bonnie said with a yawn. “Now onto more important topics. We need to finish picking out the invitations, gift bags, and champagne for the after-party.” She tapped her chin with a sparkly blue finger. “I just don’t know—do you guys think an iPod, a black T-shirt, and Gloria Vanderbilt perfume is too non-mourning?”
“I think it’s perfect.” Charlotte sat up straighter and smiled. “I mean, think how cool it is to have the newest technology, plus dark clothing for the funeral, and a new fragrance. It totally makes the whole dreary funeral less morbid.”
Bonnie nodded. “I completely agree. Plus, black doesn’t show stains.”
Which was always a plus when there was blood on your clothes from your latest killing spree.
“Hey, what about my idea?” Kathy pouted, her bottom lip protruding “I said we needed have chocolate, too. It’s comfort food…”
Charlotte shook her head. “That’s way too expensive to add now.”
“And too much work,” Bonnie agreed.
As if she cared about the gift bags when she had a bloody knife to stash before her next class.
Charlotte gasped when Bonnie extracted a tube of Chanel lipstick from her Kate Spade bag and smeared the glossy texture over her lips.
Kathy’s eyebrows shot up to her hairline. “Isn’t that Emily’s?”
Bonnie shrugged and tossed the lipstick back into her purse. “I stole it from her locker before lunch.” When the two girls stared at her in silence, she rolled her blue eyes. “What’s the big deal? It’s not like she’s going to need it anymore—she’s dead.”

After reading the two examples, writers should be able to grasp how naming the emotion, too many “emotional qualifiers,” and adverbs can make the prose stale and boring for readers.
