A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
TWISTS
After going through the transformation, the heroine is blessed with knowledge, wisdom, riches, or something that she wants, at least inwardly, because she changed so much. So many people want this kind of blessing in their life, but they are not willing to go through the rigorous experience it calls for.
Another twist might be that other characters are actively trying to stop the heroine from going through this transformation. Often people don’t want to see other people change because it calls attention to the fact that they themselves haven’t changed. The hero would butt heads with these characters because she knows they are making it more difficult on her. She would need to get some space from them or resolve issues with them in order to continue on her journey.
