A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can illustrate this lesson with things that show communication. The characters can have body language that is congruent with what’s being said, or not. In this way the lesson becomes part of the subtext.
The setting can significantly undermine a character. It can include images of the Lone Wolf, or things that are single. Or you can show items that typically belong in a group by themselves to represent the individual.
The dialogue can be very skewed one way or the other depending on the types of words that are chosen. People can speak in first person, with I, me, and you versus third person with us, we, and them. There are different ways of structuring the dialogue to bring out the idea of how the individual interacts with the group and the importance of communicating effectively. Perhaps a character mumbles or stutters.
