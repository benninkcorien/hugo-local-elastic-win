A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Female Messiah gets along with everyone because she lives without judgment, but these two archetypes still clash. The Seductive Muse is earthy and the Female Messiah is otherworldly.
The Female Messiah is very self-aware and knows she is not in touch with her body. As she sees it, her life is not for her pleasure. She may live in joy and love, but she has a mission to complete. She is in the world but not of it and that is how she can see the truth of every situation. The Seductive Muse loves her body and enjoys the sensual side of life. Her mission is to be earthy, and she doesn’t judge herself when she’s around the Female Messiah at all.
The Female Messiah will always help those around her; that is, if they are open to being helped. It is unlikely that anyone will change her. She can show the Seductive Muse what it means to find true love inside oneself with the inner beloved. Full opening of the heart charka is bliss—and, unlike romantic love, you don’t need anyone else involved in order to feel it.
