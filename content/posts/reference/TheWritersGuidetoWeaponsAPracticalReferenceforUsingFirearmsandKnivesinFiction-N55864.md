Ballistics, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Ballistics
Ballistics is the science behind how a bullet travels. From hunting to forensics, ballistics is essential to firearms in reality. It’s a little different with fiction: Writers either spend a lot of time on ballistics or none at all. The reason is the science itself. Taking the time to explain everything that goes into ballistics stops the story. But even if ballistics plays a minimal role in your story, it’s important to understand how it functions. When you’re finished with this section, have some morbid fun and sketch out how a scene’s ballistics might work given the shooter and the target character.
The Life of a Bullet
To understand ballistics, it’s important to break down what’s happening when a bullet is fired.
Gunpowder (call it propellant for some CSI flavor), measured in grains, is full of potential energy. When the gunpowder ignites, the potential energy transfers into the bullet (or projectile, again for that science feel), where it becomes kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy moves the bullet out of the barrel. As the bullet starts its journey, it increases in velocity, usually measured in feet per second.
Several factors influence the path the bullet takes, which is called a trajectory. These factors include the angle of the barrel, air temperature, elevation, and especially wind. I’ll give you a shortcut for figuring in those factors a little later.
Eventually the kinetic energy wears off, velocity decreases, and gravity tugs the bullet back to earth. This descent is called drop.
Should the bullet collide with something before it returns to earth, such as a character, the projectile sheds its kinetic energy into whatever it hits. It’s that transfer of kinetic energy that creates wounds or holes in characters or targets. How much kinetic energy is transferred is called stopping power, and it’s measured in foot-pounds.
That’s why a character who is shot point blank is going to hurt a lot more than one who is shot on the outskirts of a firearm’s range. There’s more kinetic energy, or stopping power, being transferred into the target.
Make sense? Ballistics is more about the transfer of energy and environmental factors than the bullets themselves.
When thinking about ballistics, picture a softball being thrown underhand. The ball rises slightly, then drops. Despite appearances, bullets don’t travel in perfectly straight lines. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.)
Straight as a Bullet? More Like a Softball
One assumption some writers make is that bullets travel in perfectly straight lines. However, kinetic energy doesn’t play fair. It doesn’t expend itself evenly across the bullet’s trajectory. Like Maynard Soloman at a family reunion, it can’t wait to get the hell out of there. A bullet’s kinetic energy expends a massive amount of itself to begin with, then tapers off depending on a number of factors. Because of this, the bullet actually rises a little bit as it initially exits the barrel. It then levels off for a short time before gravity gradually drags it down.
This means bullets form an arc as they travel, not a straight line. Some bullets arc more or less than others depending on the cartridge, but all abide by the same principle.
To visualize this for writing, think of throwing a softball with an underhand toss. The softball doesn’t make a straight line. It rises slightly, then returns to earth, forming an arc. It’s the same way with bullets.
Aiming
Visualizing that arc is helpful when writing. Picture it spread out across a firearm’s effective range. Here’s a quick reference for those.
Extreme range (300 to 2,000 yards): rifles specifically designed for extreme distances (.338 and .50 calibers)
Long range (100 to 300 yards): intermediate to large caliber rifles (.243, .270, .30, .30-06, .30-30, .300, .308, 7mm)
Mid-range (25 to 100 yards): small to intermediate caliber rifles (.17, .22, .22-250, .223, .243, .270), shotguns firing slugs (out to 100 yards), shotguns firing BBs (out to 50 yards), submachine guns, machine guns
Close range (25 yards on down): pistols, revolvers, submachine guns
Now think about where the target falls along that arc. Is it near the beginning of the arc? The character shooting wouldn’t need to compensate much for drop when aiming.
Is the target in the middle of the arc? The shooter would aim slightly higher.
Is it at the end of the arc, near the bullet’s maximum range, when drop becomes most severe? The character shooting would need to aim higher, perhaps a few inches, to adjust for drop.
Put into an example, let’s say Maynard Soloman is firing a rifle at a target character 200 yards away. Maynard wants to make a hit in the heart. Where should he aim?
Since 200 yards is about where Maynard’s shot starts to drop, he’d aim a couple of inches above the heart. The writing would reflect that if such a description were important to the story.
Stopping Power: Making the Hit
Stopping power is an important concept. It can impact whether a character dies or is merely wounded. Where the target is positioned along the arc determines how much kinetic energy is exerted from the bullet (stopping power).
Spots earlier in the arc offer the greatest stopping power and therefore the most damage.
Spots later in the arc have the least stopping power and inflict less damage.
That’s why small calibers aren’t cut out for long-range kills. They don’t pack much stopping power near the end of their journey.
Granted, taking a bullet at any range from any firearm can be lethal. Remember this axiom: Any firearm can be lethal, but no firearm is always lethal.
Ballistics Tables
The key to putting all of this together is ballistics tables. They’ll help you visualize those arcs. (You can download a sample ballistics table at www.WritersDigest.com/guns-knives [inactive], originally excerpted from Gun Digest 2015, edited by Jerry Lee.) Such tables are rich in information, but there are a few things to look for when using them.
First, find the cartridge on the left side. Cartridges are divided by centerfire and rimfire, rifles and handguns.
Then check out the energy at various distances. That’s the bullet’s stopping power. A higher number means more damage.
Finally, look at the trajectory across the distances. It’s measured in inches. A plus (+) sign means the bullet is rising. To be dead on, the shooter would need to compensate by aiming lower. A minus (–) sign means the bullet is falling, so the shooter should aim higher. A trajectory of -5.7 means the shooter needs to aim 5.7 inches higher to stay on target.
Other Factors
Have a solid grasp on ballistics now? Sorry, it’s time to throw a wrench into the works.
The ballistics tables don’t account for wind, elevation, temperature, sight height, and angle. In the real world, those things matter quite a bit. Gun Digest publishes entire books on how to figure that stuff out.
Here’s a tip. Use common sense and a bit of imagination to compensate for those variables as much as possible.
Wind blowing from the left will move bullets to the right. Shots travel farther in higher elevations because there is less air resistance. Bullets tend to hit lower on targets far away when the temperature is cooler.
Those are a few rules of thumb. If a full-blown CSI treatment is required, it’s time to get a dedicated ballistics book that will go in-depth on these nuances.
Psst … Here’s the Shortcut
I promised earlier there’d be a shortcut. Every writer and any person interested in this topic needs to get the ballistics calculator from Winchester. It’s one of the best resources for ballistics information, and it’s free.
Head to this URL to download the calculator for use on desktop computers: tinyurl.com/winchester-calculator.
It’s also available as an app for the iPhone. Just search for “Winchester Ballistics Calculator” in iTunes. It’ll be the first thing to pop up. As of this writing, the calculator is not in the Android store.
The calculator is a breeze to use, even for beginners. Select the type of bullet, the caliber, the range, and environmental conditions such as wind direction and air temperature. Then hit “shoot.” The calculator spits out a line graph showing the arc of the bullet, the drop, velocity, and more.
This is priceless information for writing scenes where trajectory plays a role. It visually reveals why a character might make a hit to the vitals or miss completely. Plus, because it gives you the drop, you could accurately describe where the shooter aims. Based on the drop, a character might aim at a target’s hat to put a bullet between the eyes.
Other app calculators, such as iStrelok and Bullet Drop, are more advanced and cost money.
Send in the Stick Figures
Got the bullet’s arc? Know where the characters are in the scene? Compensated for environmental factors? It’s time to send in the stick figures.
Grab a pencil and paper (you kids still know what those are, right?). Sketch out the bullet’s arc for the range specific to the scene. Draw in the characters and role-play how the ballistics would impact the written depiction.
What About Shotguns?
This section focuses on rifle and handgun ballistics for a reason. Ballistics don’t matter as much with shotguns. Patterning BBs matters more, and that’s explained in the section on shotgun ammunition.
Shotgun slugs, on the other hand, do require some ballistics figuring. They’re featured in that Winchester app. The rule of thumb, though, is that they drop a few inches at 100 yards, then nosedive into the ground like old television sets into a gravel pit. At 200 yards, for example, slugs can drop as much as 4 feet.
That’s why I don’t recommend characters use slugs beyond 100 yards. It’s just not practical.
A Quick Word About Bulletproof Vests
All this talk about kinetic energy makes it the perfect time to talk about bulletproof vests.
They work by absorbing the kinetic energy (stopping power) of a bullet. They use a web of durable fibers—such as Kevlar—woven together inside a synthetic cushion, which is then layered. Others use panels of strong resins, such as Kraton.
Both materials work the same way, trapping kinetic energy from the bullet and dispersing it into the material instead of the person wearing the vest. Imagine a soccer ball getting trapped in goal netting instead of flying into the crowd. It’s sort of like that.
That doesn’t mean 100 percent of the energy is stopped. Some shots will still cause internal injuries, break ribs, or knock down the person wearing the vest. A lucky shot might even run straight through the vest if it has enough kinetic energy. The term bulletproof is a little misleading because of this risk. Some say bullet-resistant is the more accurate term. I say either is fine when writing, with the safest bet being ballistics vest.
