REALISTIC SETTINGS
REALISTIC SETTINGS
Quote: “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on the broken glass.” —playwright and short story writer, Anton Chekhov
This chapter explains why Deep Point-of-View is one of the best editing techniques that you can use to create a realistic setting through sensory details without giving readers a weak or bland visual. The tools and tips in this section will demonstrate how writers can revise filter words used in shallower descriptions by transforming the setting into a much stronger visual.
By incorporating sensory details into a setting, along with vivid descriptions, writers can easily stay in Deeper POV. So, don’t tell me that the house was on fire, instead show me the blaze and let me feel the heat on my skin.
Here are four simple techniques to make a setting more visual: 
1)  Make the landscape active by having characters interact within it.
2)  Use color to add an extra depth to the scenery.
3)  Make the setting a vital part of the scene.
4)  Use the five senses to make the backdrop more realistic.
Sometimes writers need to simply and quickly convey details or information to the reader and move on, but if a writer applies Deeper POV on occasion, then they can bring the reader into the scene as intimately as possible.
For instance, when depicting a location/setting, describe things the way only your unique character sees them through their unique “voice” and include a few significant sensory details.
But when writers use “There was” or “There are” at the beginning of a sentence to describe an object or a setting, it creates a weak visual. These words add nothing to the scene, and sentences with these phrases can become wordy and flavorless.
Look at some examples…
WEAK: There are many witches living in the woods.
GOOD: Many witches live in the woods.
WEAK: There was a desk and a bed and lamp in the bedroom.
GOOD: The room contained an unmade bed, a dusty desk, and a tall brass lamp.

What usually draws a reader deeply into a story is the use of language and the way a writer describes a setting through the head and heart of their characters. One way to do that is to include a few of the five senses in every scene by describing them for the reader.
Please compare these next two examples…
SHALLOW:
There was a big table in the dining room and it looked like the wood was rotting. When I touched the surface it felt rough and dusty.
Now, the next example states the facts while giving readers enough of a visual to “see” the table in their mind’s eye and experience the “touch” through sensory details without describing it in a boring way.
DEEPER POV: 
A wooden table, its surface peeling away like brown bark, sat in the unused dining room. As my fingers trailed along its uneven surface, specks of dust coated my fingertips.

Showing is always much more powerful and explicit than just telling the reader, but it can often be more wordy. Yet I wouldn’t let that hinder your use of this amazing tool. Sure, simply telling the reader can be a faster way to convey a lot of details about the setting, or things like a character’s backstory and events; however, it is usually written in a way that is nondescript and slow and inelegant. It often creates long blocks of text without much “white space,” or even “voice” within the narrative.
When readers see more than a page of thick text, they know it is straight exposition. That means no action or dialogue, which equals no forward movement of the plot. Which usually means: boring.
Have I made this offense? I’m sure I have, but I try very hard to avoid it.
My advice is to never push “pause” on your story to dump out long rambles of introspection or tedious facts about the setting. Although, I realize with some genres like high-fantasy or science fiction lots of world-building is needed, the descriptions can still be cleverly woven within the narrative.
Let’s start with the description-dump. (In my guidebook, The Writer’s Guide to Vivid Scenes and Characters, I provide even more examples on how to avoid doing an info-dump of description.)
When describing a room don’t just catalog items or furniture like a monotonous list of inventory. To successfully create a visual scene, you need to balance the action of your characters with the description of the scene, along with the sensory details. Do not give your readers a weak visual through shallower writing.
(In the shallow example, I did not underline the obvious areas of shallower writing, but see if you can easily spot it.)
Please carefully compare these examples…
SHALLOW:
Sarah entered the room. There was a lamp, a couch, a tall grandfather clock and some letters on the table in the living room. Sarah saw some blood on the floor. She also observed a really bad smell. When she noticed the lifeless corpse, she got scared. When she heard the clock rang out the hour, she loudly screamed.
DEEP POV (sensory details):
Cautiously, Sarah tiptoed toward the dusty antique lamp and switched it on. Muted light illuminated the space. The stench of decay assaulted her senses as she weaved around the velvet sofa and past an oak table, which held a stack of unopened mail.
On the Oriental rug lay a bloody butcher’s knife. Her eyes widened and her pulse thumped. Sarah backed up slowly into a towering grandfather clock. Her gaze followed the trail of blood over to a body, still and pale.
When the clock bonged midnight, she screamed.

Explanations of events are much more dramatic if your readers are directly involved and experiencing them along with the character. Readers may skim long pages of unbroken description; however, if it is slipped in as part of the action, then it is absorbed by the reader almost without being noticed, and enhances the scene. Always try to mix description with dialogue, actions, and the emotions of your characters.
