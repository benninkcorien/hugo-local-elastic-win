A Writerâ€™s Guide to Characterization
WRITING LOVE SCENES
Just as your main story has a beginning, middle, and end so should your intimate love scenes. Outline the intimate relationship between your characters. Does it follow the normal progression of falling in love? Is there a beginning, middle, and end?
Do they go from falling in love at first sight to a series of chaste dates and then marriage? Do they hate each other at first? Is the heroine aggressive?
As a romance author, you have several decisions to make up front regarding sex and love.
