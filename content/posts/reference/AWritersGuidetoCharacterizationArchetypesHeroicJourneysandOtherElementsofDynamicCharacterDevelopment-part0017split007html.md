A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
You can show the hero being tested, and you can have him use or not use his intuitive senses and gut feelings to get through each test. As far as symbols go, consider incorporating things that in some ways portray innocence. It might be deep listening or even a meditative feeling. Softer colors, flowing lines, and water represent the emotions, where a lot of this sensory information comes in.
The brain takes in billions of bits of information every second, but most of this information is not stored in the conscious area of the brain. We can’t remember everything! This lesson is really about developing the part of the self that is in touch with the subconscious and the emotional being.
Many symbols can be used to represent things hidden or what’s going on below the surface. For instance, images of sailing or different ways of describing a reflection. (You can contrast these things with sharp angles and harsh lighting, as Orson Welles did in Citizen Kane). Dialogue that uses words to evoke calmness will work here. Pauses are important for this lesson. The character should pause to think or to feel, as if trying to get in touch with that part of himself that will let him know how he feels about what’s happening. A lot of that will come out in the subtext as well.
In contrast, surrounding characters might make quick or harsh judgments and use dialogue that is snappy, intellectual, or sharp. Overall they may demonstrate the downplaying and almost ridiculing of empathy, intuition, and instinct.
The setting that you choose can evoke a lot of feeling and emotion. Consider which settings in the location that you are developing can reveal that introspection the character is trying to attain, and also the instinct, gentleness, gracefulness, and generosity. You want a place that is heart-centered and caring and also something that is beautiful.
The love interest can be very intuitive or not intuitive at all. There could be a situation where the love interest is not speaking her mind about how she feels about the relationship, and the hero is trying to read her but can’t. This could make an appropriate subplot. The hero is inspired to use instinct and intuition to understand what the woman he’s in love with is trying to express.
These skills might also be used to know an elusive villain. Often in crime shows, the officers have to be intuitive, depending on the type of villain they are dealing with. The villain’s behavior can be so erratic. If pieces of the crime puzzle don’t fit together, the police don’t know what they are dealing with.
They turn to the criminal’s psychological profile and see what they can find out about him. In the process, they have to go with their gut. They try to and interpret certain things that the villain has said and what those things might mean. They have to guess what the subtext behind his actions might be. Such tasks require using their intuitive sides quite a bit. In a detective’s story, you will come upon this quality quite often.
