A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MATRIARCH AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
PHYSICAL VS. SPIRITUAL
The Matriarch doesn’t understand how the Female Messiah can pick up and leave when a cause or person beckons. The Matriarch’s first ‘mission’ is her family unit and whatever problems and needs manifest therein.
The Female Messiah resists whatever guilt trips or manipulation the Matriarch may use in attempts to control her.
The Matriarch can help the Female Messiah if she needs someone to ‘watch the troops’ while she’s off setting things up for them.
The Female Messiah can make the Matriarch aware that she is not the end-all of the universe, and she can teach the Matriarch that sometimes people have to be left to fall so they can also grow.
