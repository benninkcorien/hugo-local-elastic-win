A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
THE TIGER’S CHARACTER ARC
The tiger’s lesson is more conceptual in that it is an invitation into the mystical realm. It’s about being kingly, but with some sensuality and unpredictability. It’s about exploring big questions at a deep level. It is about examining life and why we are here, and thinking more deeply about how we live and the different systems that govern our lives. It’s about learning how to use your power and position in a healthy way; that is, how to be a king, not a tyrant.
You must have your basic needs met before you can explore these deeper aspects of life. In this way, the Tiger is set.
The character arc for this lesson can be:
   •  The hero finds himself coming to a crossroads, coming to a place where everything he wanted and has accomplished, all of his earthly goals, are achieved. He may not have much of a goal left to pursue except for enlightenment. He could be on his way toward reaching his goal when he wonders, “What’s this all for?” This lesson could impact the plot in a big way because he may decide to abandon the main goal of the story.
   •  Or, you’ve hit the midpoint of the story and the goal is achieved and the readers are wondering what’s next. We know the story is going to continue, but there’s a moment of wondering if the writer messed up. Then the hero does something to cause a new direction to emerge, a higher longing brings with it a new goal.
   •  Or, the hero is learning about the right use of power and how power can corrupt.
   •  Or, the hero is learning about mystical power and otherworldly knowledge.
Tiger is about adventure and being colorful and exploring the world and new ideas. You’re at a place in life where the basic needs are met and you have the option to think about other things more deeply and explore the meaning of life and what it means to you.
Having some sense of honesty and wanting to find answers is key because sometimes people already have an agenda to prove. They will explore things, but they already have an answer in mind and they are trying to prove that answer. It’s important for them to be open-minded about what they might find or what they’re looking for and allow those answers to take them in different direction.
The hero can be somebody who retires early. Now he can do more of what he wants to do. The hero can be born into money, or he may inherit money, and it allows him to find a new purpose in life.
I lived in a building once with a lot of celebrities and people who had trust funds. I found it interesting to observe these people, who had lots of time and resources, and to see what they did with them. In some cases they were self-destructive because they were bored and couldn’t find meaning in their lives. In others, they were more balanced. Someone taught them to be more charitable and to take interest in social good and making changes in life in general. Some friends of mine, for instance, started Mindshare—a community organization in downtown L.A.—to explore ideas, yoga, and technology.
