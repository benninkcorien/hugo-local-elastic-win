A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE AMAZON
MENTAL VS. PHYSICAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and SURVIVAL motivates the Amazon. He needs to feel vulnerable to change, and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. The Amazon can make him feel vulnerable, if she’s strong around him and acts like his equal.
She wants to find a place of her own and to be recognized for her contributions. The King will value what she does, but he’s looking for the perfect woman to settle down with. He’s better off with someone more subservient so there will be less fighting at home. He wants his home to be his sanctuary.
She doesn’t want to be protected or saved. She wants to do that herself. He’s willing to let her save herself, but he will always see her as a somewhat silly woman for being so assertive. If she messes up even in the slightest, he will laugh with her and at her.
He may not know how to act around the Amazon because he’s so used to having people grovel around him, and she won’t do that.
She gets frustrated if he condescends to her. He will never see her as an equal, but thinks it’s cute how she tries so hard. Such opinions really push her buttons.
