REDUNDANT PHRASES
REDUNDANT PHRASES
Quote: “Writers need good descriptions of facial expressions in their stories to help the readers picture the characters, to convey emotions, and to set up lines of dialogue without having to write “said” or any of its synonyms. However, it’s easy for us to rely on the same descriptions over and over again.” —author, Bryn Donovan
A redundant phrase is one used repeatedly to describe an expression, gesture, or emotion.
Please keep in mind that clichés are the enemy of good writing.
I strongly advise the writers that I work with to avoid describing facial expressions by using overworked clichés. If writers resort to using clichés, like His smile was dazzling or Her eyes shone like diamonds or His face was red as a beet, readers will understand the meaning, but the phrases are so unoriginal that it won’t have much impact.
By using a stale cliché or redundant phrase, a writer is actually telling the reader that they lack originality. So I encourage writers to craft a more unique description, rather than relying on a cliché.
In this chapter, I have provided helpful alternatives to overused gestures and facial expressions (not saying mine are terribly original) that should inspire writers to describe a gesture, action, or expression in a different way.
I have put together a list of ways to rewrite certain redundant phrases and clichés…
