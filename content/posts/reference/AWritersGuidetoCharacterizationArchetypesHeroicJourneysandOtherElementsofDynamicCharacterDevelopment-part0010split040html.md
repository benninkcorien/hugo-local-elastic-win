A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE MATRIARCH
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
LOVE AND BELONGING motivate the Woman’s Man, and LOVE, BELONGING, AND RESPECT motivate the Matriarch. He needs to learn how to value himself as a man and to stop running away from responsibility. She can teach him to be responsible, but she may do it in a way that makes him defensive; for example, she may give orders or ultimatums. She loves to be in control and won’t be able to cope if he is so unpredictable.
She needs to commit to herself as much as she commits to her husband or family. She will probably spend much of her time attempting to make sure he doesn’t walk out on her. She will take care of everything, and may feel like he’s taking her for granted. If she does, look out because she will stand up for herself.
Marriage is very important to her, so if they are married, she won’t give up easily on him. If they aren’t married, she may be more lenient with him because she longs to be married.
Deep down inside he knows she does a lot for him and he respects her. He just wants her to let loose and enjoy life. He wants a playmate, not a matron.
She respects his playful nature and knows he loves her but she may do better with a more subservient man. On the other hand, a more powerful husband can set limits on her ‘queendom,’ thus stopping her from taking over the kids’ lives.
She may secretly yearn to be more like the Woman’s Man—carefree, playful, easygoing.
