A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE KING AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
MENTAL VS. SPIRITUAL
SELF-ESTEEM and SELF-RESPECT motivate the King, and an AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to feel vulnerable to change and sometimes a tragic event is what does it. She can help him change, but he may not enjoy the way she goes about it. She can really push people.
She needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. He is so used to structure and planning that he can’t help her with this at all. He’s not even sure he believes what she believes in. At first it may seem funny to him, but sooner or later he’ll expect her to calm down and find a new direction in life.
If he’s willing to suspend his disbelief, he can be an asset because he can help her make a plan and get people together to carry out that plan.
He can be a drawback if he refuses to take her seriously or believe in her. He can cause her to doubt herself and her task. He may also try to do everything for and take control of the situation. He won’t do things her way, though, and that’s the problem.
She won’t sit still for too long unless she’s living in an oppressive society for women. This doesn’t fit well with the King, who wants to build a mini kingdom at home.
She always has a new agenda or cause to work for, and the King can’t deal with that. Either he is the number one thing in her life or it’s over.
