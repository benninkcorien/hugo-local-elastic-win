A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
HOW CAN YOU ILLUSTRATE THIS LESSON?
Blubber is a natural source of protection, insulation, and nourishment for the whale. You can surround your character with cocoonlike insulation. It can be a sort of coddling that other characters create around her to try to protect her or keep her in denial. What if the one who hurt the heroine was her own mother? The rest of the family may not want the heroine to uncover her past because it would mean dragging the family into a dramatic situation.
The heroine may be protecting herself from her own memories. The whole family may use alcohol or drugs, or may have other addictions (like watching too much television) to numb and insulate themselves. In many ways, the blubber for a whale is a positive thing, protection and nourishment. The heroine can find this protection and nourishment when she enters the right environment and gains the right skills. The heroine needs to make the move from the numbing way of dealing with her difference to the nourishing way of dealing with her difference.
In the setting this can show up symbolically. You can show how protective her home or world has become. Or you can show other characters trying to create a home that will protect this character from herself.
That sense of protection can come through in mood and tone as well. For instance you might use songs from the 1950s to illustrate society’s view of life and things that your characters are expected to do on a daily basis. Random images and pictures that support the status quo will work too.
The subtext can be about doing what you are supposed to do and doing what is expected of you, being normal, fitting in, and toeing the line.
