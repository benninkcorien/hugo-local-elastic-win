A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
STORY EXAMPLES
Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston
This story is about a heroine named Janie achieving a strong sense of self and finding her voice. Many characters try to stifle her and suppress her individuality but she learns to stand up for herself and use her voice (and sometimes silence) to her benefit.
The Crucible by Arthur Miller
In this story of the Salem witch trials, the author suggests that “there was no room in Salem for individuality,” and uses characters John and Elizabeth Proctor to express this idea. They both voice opinions that go against authority and tradition, which is the essence of freethinking.
Avatar
Two groups of individuals work together amongst themselves but clearly one group (the Navi) is far superior to the other (the humans). The Navi includes nature and their home as part of their group and work in harmony to ensure a future in which all can prosper. The Navi rally to help one another and live by present moment wisdom over rigid rules, taking the ‘individual’ into account.
Little Miss Sunshine
A young girl wants to compete in a beauty pageant and the family has to learn to work together in order to make it happen.
