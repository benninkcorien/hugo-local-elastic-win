A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE PROTECTOR AND THE WOMAN’S MAN
PHYSICAL VS. EMOTIONAL
This is an interesting pairing of archetypes. The Woman’s Man loves women and is very spontaneous. He can go with the flow of life more easily than the Protector, who needs to be more in control. At the same time the Protector is very accomplished because he can set limits and he disciplines himself to get the job done.
They are both very earthy, external, right-brain types. Neither of them have aspirations to run a megacompany like the Businessman. But while the Woman’s Man seeks women to fill the void in his life, the Protector would seeks other men like himself to wrestle or compete with.
The Protector can teach the Woman’s Man how to set limits and accept discipline as a positive thing in life. He can teach the Woman’s Man to be more self-reliant.
The Woman’s Man can teach the Protector how to let loose and enjoy the spontaneous moments of life, how to be sensual, how to pamper himself and enjoy the luxuries of life. He can also teach the art of romancing a woman.
