SHALLOW: FATIGUED
SHALLOW: FATIGUED
Quote: “Description, your description, paints in the story-world just as a reader is walking through it. For the reader, the story-world doesn’t exist before the moment he/she encounters it...” —fiction editor, Beth Hill of “A Novel Edit” (I had the honor to work with Beth on my adult PNR novel, IMMORTAL ECLIPSE, and she’s an amazing editor.)
When your character is tired or fatigued, I would show the character’s mental and physical exhaustion through Deeper POV. I realize that it is much simpler to just state that a character is drowsy or that a character looks exhausted, but I think it is much more fun to show the reader instead—don’t you?
Exhaustion can come from many different things, such as an illness or depression. It can cause a character to use poor judgment or be a side effect of prescription drugs, and in some cases, dehydration may even be to blame. Stress and insomnia can also be major factors of extreme fatigue.
In this chapter, I have put together some examples to further explain what I mean. Please use them as a reference and inspiration for your own stories.
Some physical signs of exhaustion might be:
Loud yawning
Heavy eyelids
Droopy eyelids
Weakness in limbs
Cannot concentrate
Bloodshot eyes
Dark circles under the eyes
A disheveled appearance
Clumsiness
Slurred speech
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: I feel so exhausted from running the marathon.
DEEP POV: My legs wobble and a bout of dizziness strikes my senses when I finish running the marathon.
SHALLOW: When Clary saw Noah still wearing last night’s clothes, she realized that he hadn’t slept at all.
DEEP POV: Noah lumbered into the house like a zombie. His shirt and pants were wrinkled, and his face unshaven. He must’ve been up all night studying.
SHALLOW: I yawned, and then I went into the bathroom to put cold water on my face because I was so sleepy. My eyes looked tired in the mirror.
DEEP POV: Yawning loudly, I stumbled into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. My reflection in the mirror revealed bags under my bloodshot eyes.
SHALLOW: I felt sleepy and worn-out.
DEEP POV: My movements were heavy and sluggish like I was trudging through snow.
SHALLOW: Sophia felt so drowsy that she tried to not fall asleep during the lecture.
DEEP POV: Sophia rubbed at her eyes with tiny fists and fought to stay awake during the longwinded lecture.
SHALLOW: I wanted to go back to bed because I was so weary from being up with the baby.
DEEP POV: My body swayed and I dragged my feet into the dark bedroom. As I fell over into the softness of the comforter and pillow, my drooping eyelids instantly closed.
SHALLOW: Dan looked sleepy and he fell asleep in class. He started snoring loudly. The teacher got mad and woke him up.
DEEP POV: Dan’s breathing slowed and his eyelids grew heavy. He rested his head on the desk and his eyes closed. He must’ve been snoring, because the teacher shook him awake.
SHALLOW (cannot yawn dialogue): “No, I’m awake,” I yawned.
DEEP POV: “No, I’m awake,” I muttered, yawning and stretching my weary limbs.
SHALLOW: She felt lethargic, but worry prevented her from falling asleep.
DEEP POV: She sagged onto a chair with a glazed look in her eyes. Sleep would be impossible now.
SHALLOW: I was exhausted and sat on the sofa. I could probably sleep standing up. (Cliché.) I closed my eyes and went to sleep.
DEEP POV: Collapsing onto the sofa, my eyes drifted shut. My whole body sagged into the cushions and sleep came quickly.

Here are two longer examples of showing an exhausted character. (In the shallow example, I did not underline the shallower writing, but see if you can clearly identify it now that you’re more aware of showing vs. telling.)
Please closely examine these two scenes…
SHALLOW (info-dump): 
Aaron felt very tired. He wanted to go to sleep, but he had to wait up until his little brother got home from the birthday party. He tried to stay awake by turning up the sound on the TV, but it did not help him stay awake.
Aaron went into the kitchen and he made some coffee. He hoped that the caffeine would keep him from falling asleep. His mom counted on him to look after his younger brother while she worked nights, but he was too young at seventeen to be like a parent to his brother. When the coffee was ready, he drank a lot of cups, and then he felt more awake.
He heard the front door open as Aaron entered the living room. Now his brother was finally home, and he could to sleep.
DEEP POV: 
Aaron yawned and sank lower on the couch. His lids, heavy with fatigue, gradually began to close and his body seemed to liquefy into the softness of the sofa. He had the urge to go upstairs and climb into bed, but he had to wait until his little brother, Gabe, got home from the birthday party.
“Wake up,” he said aloud to the empty room. “Do not fall asleep, Aaron.”
His mom would kill him if he did.
He sat up and grabbed the TV remote.  Aaron cranked the volume on the western he’d been watching, but within seconds, his head fell back onto the headrest.
No, no, no. Stay awake!
The seventeen-year-old stood and stretched, then shuffled into the kitchen. He made a pot of strong coffee and leaned against the counter, the floor cold beneath his bare feet.
Aaron glanced at the clock on the wall. Only eleven. His mom wouldn’t be home for hours from the hospital. Since she’d started working the graveyard shift, she counted on him to look after Gabe.
“This sucks,” he grumbled. “I’m too young to act like Gabe’s damn parent. It isn’t fair.”
When the coffee finished brewing, he poured himself a steaming mug. Aaron gulped down three cups until the caffeine buzz jolted his system.
The front door clicked open as Aaron walked into the living room. Finally, Gabe was home and Aaron could hit the sack.

The tools in this chapter should help writers rework any shallower writing that appears in early drafts. And I would study the work of other authors in your genre to get ideas on phrasing and sentence structure, and also inspiration for characterization.
