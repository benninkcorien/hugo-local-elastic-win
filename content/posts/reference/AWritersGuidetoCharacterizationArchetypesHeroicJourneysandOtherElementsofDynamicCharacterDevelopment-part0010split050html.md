A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE MALE MESSIAH AND THE FEMALE MESSIAH
SPIRITUAL VS. SPIRITUAL
THE AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF motivates the Male Messiah, and the AESTHETIC NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO SOMETHING GREATER motivates the Female Messiah. He needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events, to trust what guides him, and to face his doubts.
She also needs to learn to let go of the outcome of events and to trust what guides her. Maybe together they can support each other and be there for the rough times. Sometimes seeing the bright side to someone else’s problems helps you see the bright side to your own.
They can help each other carry out their missions. They may truly honor and respect each other. They have to be careful not to get too attached to each other, though. In this way, they can become a drawback for each other.
They can be great friends and offer much solace, as no one else may understand them or their actions. They are like soul mates, but they may never get to be together because their missions are always top priority.
Sometimes they have almost a psychic connection and can tell what the other one is doing across long distances.
