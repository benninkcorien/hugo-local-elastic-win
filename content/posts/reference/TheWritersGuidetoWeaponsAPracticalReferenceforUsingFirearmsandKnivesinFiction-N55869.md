How to Kill a Character with a Firearm, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
How to Kill a Character with a Firearm
Here’s the down-and-dirty version of this section: Shoot the character in the head or heart, then kick back and call it a day.
For anything beyond a quick and convenient kill, answer these questions in order.
1. How Far Away Is the Character?
First, determine the range of the character being shot. There’s no need to break out the yardstick; ranges can be broken down into general categories. There are a few ways to do this, but I like the approach thirty-year law enforcement veteran Scott Wagner takes in his book Gun Digest Book of Survival Guns. The designations here are inspired by that work and the following quoted material from the book.
Extreme range: about 300 to 2,000 yards. “While our modern military snipers are getting kills out to 2,000 yards [6,000 feet] or so, this is performance reserved for a few highly trained and exceptional individuals with very specialized rifles,” Wagner writes.
Long range: 300 yards maximum. “For the average shooter or law enforcement officer, ‘long range’ is anything beyond 100 yards,” according to Wagner.
Mid-range: Wagner says, “Anything from 100 yards down to about 25 yards.”
Close range: This category includes anything 25 yards down to “eye-gouging distance,” according to Wagner.
2. Is the Firearm Used by the Shooter Effective at that Range?
With range determined, next figure out if the firearm is effective at that distance. Writers are free to use longer-range firearms for shorter distances but not vice versa.
Extreme-range firearms: rifles specifically designed for extreme distances (.338 and .50 calibers)
Long-range firearms: intermediate to large caliber rifles (.243, .270, .30, .30-06, .30-30, .300, .308, 7mm)
Mid-range firearms: small to intermediate caliber rifles (.17, .22, .22-250, .223, .243, .270); shotguns firing slugs (out to 100 yards); shotguns firing BBs (out to 50 yards); submachine guns; machine guns
Close-range firearms: pistols, revolvers, shotguns, submachine guns
3. Could a Shot Hit the Target in a Vital Area?
If a character is in range of the shooter’s firearm, the next element to assess is the possibility of a lethal shot.
There are many variables to this equation, but a hit in one or more of these areas will most likely result in death:
head
face
neck
chest (heart, lung)
upper back (lung)
lower middle back (kidneys)
upper thigh (femoral artery)
Areas that would most likely inflict severe damage, but perhaps not death, include:
spine
inner arm (brachial artery)
abdomen (the “guts”)
groin
ribs (splinters of bone penetrating heart or lungs)
Areas that would wreck someone’s day but may not be considered a mortal wound:
face (without piercing brain or neck)
hands
wrists
knees
feet
ankles
outer arms
Again, these are rules of thumb. Variables can change a lethal hit into a mere injury or vice versa.
4. How Likely Is the Shooter to Hit the Character?
If all the conditions are met up to this point, it’s time to assess whether a hit is likely at all. Factors that can cause a miss include the following:
The shooter and/or the target character are in motion.
The shooter lacks firearms experience.
An obstacle comes between the shooter and the character.
The shooter is firing in a confusing or chaotic setting.
The shooter is firing in low-light settings.
The shooter is injured or impaired.
The firearm misfires or jams.
If none of those factors apply, or are negated by some other variable, chances are good that a well-placed shot with a firearm will kill a character.
A Quick Note About Moving Targets
A shooter must “lead” a target that’s in motion. That means firing ahead of the moving target. The faster the target, the more lead must be granted. This can vary from a few feet to several yards.
This is tricky to do and requires some shooting experience. Characters inexperienced with firearms would have a tough time hitting a moving target at any range.
Example Scenarios
Would a kill with a firearm be likely in the following scenarios?
Scenario 1: The Getaway Car
Barreling down the crowded freeway, gal-damn detective Maynard Soloman steered his RV parallel to Bill Robber’s convertible. He rolled down the window and aimed a revolver at Bill’s head only a few feet away.
“Eat lead, ya mug,” Maynard said and pulled the trigger.
Would Maynard have made a kill shot? Maybe.
Bill was in range of Maynard’s revolver, but both of them were in motion. This makes landing a kill difficult. It’s hard enough to be accurate with a handgun standing still. However, there’s enough wiggle room for creative license to plant the kill shot successfully (or not). Bullets travel faster than cars.
Scenario 2: The Eagle’s Nest
Maynard climbed up the tall bell tower of the church, shotgun in hand. With a pair of binoculars, he spotted Bill Robber on the far side of a long parking lot several blocks away. Maynard lined up the shotgun’s sights and pulled the trigger, sending BBs rushing toward Bill.
Is this a kill shot? No.
Bill is a long way from Maynard. That range sounds better suited for a sniper rifle, not a shotgun.
Scenario 3: The Midnight Intruder
Maynard woke to the sound of someone kicking down the side door of his RV. In the light of the full moon, he could see the glow of Bill Robber standing in the filthy kitchenette.
Maynard quickly popped a magazine into his bedside pistol and took aim at Bill’s chest. His trembling finger found the trigger just as Bill stepped into the bedroom.
Did Maynard get Bill this time? Probably.
Maynard’s pistol is the right choice for an up-close-and-personal encounter. But that “trembling finger” and the nighttime conditions might have resulted in a miss.
In this case, it’s up to the author to determine how the scene plays out.
A Quick Note About Death
As mentioned in other sections of this guide, not everyone shot in the vitals dies immediately. Just as chickens with their heads lopped off still run around (that’s not a myth, by the way; I helped butcher chickens as a kid), humans can stay in motion for a short time after a lethal hit.
In The Midnight Intruder scenario, this could mean Maynard makes a lethal shot but still winds up with injuries if Bill can cover the short distance between them before he dies.
