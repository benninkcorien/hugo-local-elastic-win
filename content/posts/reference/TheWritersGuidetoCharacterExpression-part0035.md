EMOTION: RESENTMENT
EMOTION: RESENTMENT
Quote: “Even if you find the bad-guy generally repulsive, you need to be able to put yourself so thoroughly into his shoes while you’re writing him that, just for those moments, you almost believe his slant [viewpoint] yourself.” —bestselling author, K. M. Weiland
Resentment is typically a companion emotion to envy and jealousy, and also bitterness. Feelings of resentment can result in a combination of animosity, anger, or even hatred from a real or imagined wrong or insult. Resentment can be a great way to add an extra layer of tension to any scene, or it could be a character’s fatal flaw.
Resentment is typically an indication of a weakness. The villain of your story could be harboring a deep resentment for your hero, or maybe it’s your main character that has this fatal flaw to overcome. This emotion can have a very negative affect on your character and how he/she reacts to certain situations. As a fatal flaw, it can make envy churn through their veins. Bitterness taste like bile. And even stain their soul. Use this emotion to add another layer of depth to your character’s personality or use it as a theme.
Some physical signs of resentment might be:
Speaking sarcastically
Eyes widening
Speaking in a demeaning way
Looking down or away
Furrowed brows
Bared teeth
Mouth slack
Posture stiff
Face reddens
Neck grows hot
Examples on how to revise shallow writing:
SHALLOW: “Not now!” he said cruelly and felt a deep resentment.
DEEP POV: His thin lips were pressed tight. His words slow and menacing, “I…said…not…now.”
SHALLOW: Wendee sounded resentful when she asked for tea.
DEEP POV: Wendee picked lint off her sleeve. “What time is tea? You did remember to make tea didn’t you, Willow?”
SHALLOW: He resented my promotion.
DEEP POV: His chin tilted defensively higher and he turned his head slightly away.
SHALLOW: She looked like she bore a grudge against me.
DEEP POV: Her cheeks puckered as if she’d tasted a sour lemon.
SHALLOW: I have hard feelings about losing the race.
DEEP POV: I forced a smile while I gritted my teeth.
SHALLOW: I could tell she felt bitter about the divorce.
DEEP POV: Whenever the topic came up about her divorce, she avoided my eyes.

Here are two scenes to further illustrate my point on the difference between showing vs. telling that should inspire your creative muse. (I have underlined what I consider to be shallower writing.)
Please carefully examine these examples…
SHALLOW:
I was supposed to get the lead role in the school play and not Avery Weinstein.
She walked onto the stage and I instantly resented her presence. I had no reason to hate her, but I did. I hated everything about the girl. I resented her curvy body and beautiful face, and because she was popular with the other boys at school.
My eyes turned green with envy as I stared at that girl who had stolen my part. I couldn’t stand the sight of Avery.
“We’re Romeo and Juliet,” Avery said delicately. She was good, I thought resentfully. “And we’ll love each other until we die.”
It was time to rehearse the kissing scene. I saw Benjamin clumsily move toward her, but then I watched him trip and lose his balance.
“I love you, too, my Juliet,” he said hoarsely as he fell forward into her body.
“I’ve got you.” I heard Avery laugh, and then I saw her catch him before he fell.
Then I watched him kiss her mouth. It was a long kiss and I felt even more bitterness. I saw their arms go around each other and then I heard him groan into her mouth.
“Stop action,” Sofia, the director, said loudly.
I had felt and seen the attraction between Benjamin and Avery and it made me feel sick with revulsion. I decided that they did not mind kissing in front of the cast. If there weren’t so many people around, I would have told Avery how much I loathed her.
“What a fun time I am having,” Avery said happily. “What did you think of my performance, London?” I saw her look right at me.
“You were great,” I said bitterly.
Please study this revised version with “voice” and sensory details.
DEEP POV:
I was supposed to get the lead role in the school play—not stuck-up Avery Weinstein!
She strutted onto the stage like a queen with her commercial white smile.
I had no reason to hate Avery, but every fiber of my being felt strung tight. I hated her long, pale hair, her big brown eyes, and her flawless acting abilities. And the fact that she had more boys hanging on her than any other girl in school.
I stared at that disgustingly pretty girl who’d stolen my part, with an ugly sneer. I lifted a strand of my stringy black hair and then eyeballed her shiny blond waves. Yeah, I wanted her to break a leg. For real.
“We’re Romeo and Juliet,” Avery said in a light, whimsical voice. Damn, she was good. “And we’ll love each other until we die.”
Time to rehearse the kiss. Benjamin staggered toward her, tripping over the laces of his untied boots and losing his balance.
“I love you, too, my Juliet,” he said, stumbling into her.
“Whoa there!” Avery giggled, catching him and he steadied himself.
Then he kissed her passionately. The seconds ticked by. Their arms wound around each other and he groaned softly.
Can anyone say, awkward?
“Cut!” Sofia, the director, shouted.
Not too soon either. The sizzling chemistry between Benjamin and Avery was totally nauseating, and they obviously had no qualms about making out in front of the cast. If there weren’t so many people around, I would’ve pretended to gag.
“That was fun!” Avery smiled, then her gaze fell upon me. “What do you think, London? Was I great, or what?”
“Yeah, you were, um, great,” I said, but my voice sounded tainted with sourness.
***
By giving your characters tangible emotions and physical reactions like in the revised scene above, it gives the people inhabiting your story-world even more realism.
