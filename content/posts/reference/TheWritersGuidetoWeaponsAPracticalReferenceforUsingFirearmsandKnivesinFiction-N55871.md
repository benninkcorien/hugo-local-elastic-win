Knife Safety, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Knife Safety
Like firearms, knives have their own safety guidelines for proper use. Characters familiar with knives would understand these basic principles:
Knives are a little like guns in that they shouldn’t be directed at people and things that shouldn’t be cut. So when using a knife, cut away from your body—or anyone else’s body for that matter—because if the knife suddenly jerks forward, you don’t want it to cause an injury.
Running with scissors is a bad idea, and the same goes for knives. Dramatic foot chases involving knives are just begging for an accident. Stick those knives back in their sheaths.
Avoid using the knife for utility purposes inside your own “Triangle of Death.” Picture the triangular space between your inner thighs and groin when your legs are spread apart—that’s the Triangle of Death. A cut to these areas could cause severe blood loss or death in a matter of minutes. This concern is most common when sitting hunched over and using the knife to cut rope, whittle, etc.
A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. Duller blades slip easier when attempting to cut through something. And a knife that slips is going to cut something you didn’t intend to cut—never a good thing.
Not every knife that folds works the same way. It’s a good idea to find out exactly how it works before fumbling around with one. That’s how people lose fingers.
If a knife falls, don’t try to catch it. Let it hit the ground. The same goes for a knife in flight—unless you’re Jack Burton. On that note, Big Trouble in Little China is required viewing for learning how not to depict knives and firearms. Kurt Russell’s character commits almost every sin this guide tries to dispel, although that may have been intentional.
Passing a knife with an exposed blade (such as a butcher knife or an open folding knife) to someone else is always tricky. Should you hand it over handle first or blade first? Handle first is the best method, but that doesn’t mean you should grip the blade and risk an injury. Turn the knife over so the spine (the thin, unsharpened edge on top of the blade) rests between your thumb and index finger, then grip the handle. Extend the handle to the other person to pass off the knife. Of course, throwing the knife to the other person is another option, but it’s not polite.
In many cases in fiction, these guidelines will have to be broken, but it’s still a good idea to keep them in mind.
