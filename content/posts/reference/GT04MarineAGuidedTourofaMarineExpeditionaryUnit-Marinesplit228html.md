Marine
Cargo Pier, Port of Muara, Brunei, 1300 Hours, September 21st, 2008
There had been little time for niceties like tugboats and fenders; the captains of the MPSRON 3 ships had just driven right in. Luckily, they'd caught the tides right, and were able to moor the big Ro-Ros with a minimum of scraped paint and bent plating. The stern ramps dropped, and vehicles poured out. A few hours earlier, the first elements of the III MEF's fly-in brigade from Okinawa had arrived at BSB International Airport. Riding in the same commandeered buses that had been used to block the taxiways and runways just twelve hours earlier, the first elements of the brigade were driven directly to the wharf, where they mounted up their M1A1s, AAAVs, LAVs, and HMMWVs and began to fan out across Brunei.
It normally would take eighteen hours to finish the unloading of the combat vehicles, with another three days to off-load supplies. But now everything had to be done sooner, because the Army's AWR-3 squadron would arrive in sixty hours, and they would need to use the same port facilities. When the Army mountain brigade arrived, plus an additional fly-in brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division, there would be a division-sized task force in Brunei. The concept of the operation was to rapidly build up a force big enough to overmatch anything the Malaysians could throw against the beachhead. So far it had worked.
The biggest current worry was the armored task force holding the oil facilities on the western side of the country. Colonel Taskins knew that Major Hansen's force was stretched thin. If she were the Malaysian brigade commander, that was the place that she would attack. She strode across the pier to speak with Brigadier General Mike Newman, commander of the units off-loading from the ships.
She came to the point quickly. "Mike, I think that we have a potential problem out in the oil-fields."
Looking up from his data slate, he replied, "How so, Colleen?"
"Sir, I believe that Major Hansen's task force is overstretched out at Seria. He needs some reinforcement and support."
Newman stood up, wiped his brow for a moment, and asked, "What did you have in mind?"
Her reply was again clear and rapid, "General, I want to move another company of infantry and the heavy weapons company over to the western side this afternoon. I also want to land the 155mm battery, and get some additional surveillance assets over to them. They can probably stand up to one or two counterattacks, but anything more could cause us real problems over there, sir."
"We're scheduled to relieve them tomorrow morning with a battalion landing team," Newman replied. Then he thought for a moment, remembering that this lady had never given him bad advice. "Maybe you're right." He turned to his operations officer and asked, "Harry, what's the situation on the brigade ACE moving down from Cubi Point?"
The Operations Officer referred to his own data slate, and replied, "Well, sir, we've got the first squadrons of F/A-18Ds and AV-8Bs down and dispersed, as well as some tankers. Two squadrons of MV-22Bs are on the way right now. They should be ready to start flying CAP and support missions before sundown."
"Tell you what, Colleen. Why don't you send the reinforcements over this afternoon, and I'll chop your whole ACE back to you to support them. Will that do?"
"Yes, sir!" This errand done, she headed back to Bon Homme Richard to make arrangements.
