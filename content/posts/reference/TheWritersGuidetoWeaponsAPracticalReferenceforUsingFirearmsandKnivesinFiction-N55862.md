Holsters and Concealed Carry, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Holsters and Concealed Carry
There’s a lot to know about holsters, but one takeaway you must not miss is Bianchi’s Law. It’s a concept in the firearms world that goes like this: “The same gun, in the same place, all the time.”
Assign one (or more) holster to a specific part of a character’s body, and then don’t veer from that selection. It takes practice to build the muscle memory required to draw a handgun smoothly from a holster. So avoid writing wandering holsters.
Also, one-size-fits-all holsters do not exist. A holster might be designed to work with several firearm models, but that doesn’t suggest universal compatibility. Let’s take a look at some key aspects of holsters that will help make your writing accurate and clear.
Right- or Left-Handed?
Assigning a holster actually starts with determining if the character is right- or left-handed. This matters because the best way to draw a handgun is usually from the “strong side.” For example, a right-handed character would be drawing the handgun from the right side of the body, where the character likely has the best strength and dexterity.
If that right-handed character positioned the holster on the left instead of the right, that would be called a “cross draw holster.”
The strong side is the best choice, though. And the best part of the body to attach that holster to is the hip. In his book Gun Digest Book of Concealed Carry Second Edition, renowned firearms expert Massad Ayoob says, “The strong-side hip is the odds-on choice for weapon placement. … It is also the standard location for law enforcement officers in uniform. This is probably not coincidental. Many ranges, police academies, and shooting schools will allow only strong-side holsters. The theory behind this is that cross draw will cause the gun muzzles to cross other shooters and range officers when weapons are drawn or holstered.”
Types of Holsters
There are as many variations of holsters as there are handguns. This section of the chapter boils down everything for the sake of practicality.
All holsters can be put into one of two categories: retention or automatic locking.
Retention holsters offer a snug fit and are used for either revolvers or pistols.
Auto-lock holsters, designed for pistols, use an internal lock that must be pressed to release the handgun. There’s an audible click as the handgun is holstered and locked in place. Law enforcement characters might use this to prevent someone from grabbing their handguns.
Within those categories, holsters are classified by how they’re worn.
Hip holsters, as mentioned, are the most popular. As the name suggests, they secure to a belt and lie against the hip. Hip holsters can be moved along the belt to other places, such as the back. Holsters designed specifically for wearing at the back are called small-of-back holsters.
The IWB holster gives characters a fresh take on the “Is that a pistol in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” cliché. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Some hip holsters are designed to sit on the inside of the pants instead of the outside. These are called inside-the-waistband (IWB) holsters. IWB holsters are perfect for concealed carry. They allow clothing to lie or tuck over the holster. This greatly reduces the visibility of the handgun, provided the holster doesn’t cause the clothing to bulge. However, IWB holsters are more difficult to draw. Clothing must be moved out of the way (lifting up a shirt, for example) to access the holster. An inexperienced character would have a tougher time making a smooth draw with an IWB.
While hip holsters have the edge in real-world effectiveness and popularity, shoulder holsters (which are strapped to the shooter’s shoulder with the firearm positioned against the ribs) dominate in fiction and film. Ayoob acknowledges this in his book:
“Ah, yes, the shoulder holster is a part of the whole noir scene, in movies and novels alike. … The mid-twentieth century saw Mickey Spillane’s classic ‘hard-boiled private eye,’ Mike Hammer, carrying a .45 automatic in a shoulder rig. … [Another] popular paperback private eye of the 1960s, Shell Scott, was armed by author Richard S. Prather with a snub-nose Colt Detective Special .38 in a clamshell shoulder holster. … The late Ian Fleming equipped [James Bond] with a Beretta .25 in a chamois shoulder holster in the early novels.”
Unlike hip holsters, shoulder holsters should not be attached to the strong side of the body. Shoulder holsters are cross draw only. A right-handed character would draw from a shoulder holster secured to the left side of the body.
Shoulder holsters secure to the body using a “rig” or harness. When writing, factor in that the character is wearing something underneath the rig. A shoulder holster against bare skin is going to leave a mark. Toss a jacket or coat over the top, and now the handgun is concealed. Just remember that a character would have to open that garment to access the holster.
Women often prefer shoulder holsters. Females tend to have narrower chests than males. This allows for a shorter, easier reach to access the holster.
Shoulder holsters are also popular with people who do a lot of sitting, because a hip holster could get in the way. Consider a disgruntled and well-armed tollbooth operator. (Now there’s a character idea!)
Pocket holsters are inserted into, suitably enough, the pocket. Because of their positioning, they use retention to secure the handgun, not auto locks, and are positioned on the strong side of the body. Pocket holsters can be awkward to use without the right pair of pants. That’s why they’re sometimes inserted into a vest, a jacket, or coat pockets instead.
In fiction, handguns are sometimes fired through the pocket. Reality actually backs this up, but it’s not a great idea. I didn’t feel like testing this out, but Ayoob did. He had students at his firearm school give it a try. In his book, he says, “Three of the participants used [pistols] for firing through coat pockets. All three specimens went five shots for five tries without a malfunction. The shooters did notice that it was distracting to have trapped, hot casings burning their hands and wrists inside the pockets.”
In other words, in reality it’s possible, but not comfortable, for a pocket shot. Have at it, writers. Just watch out for those hot casings.
Ankle holsters secure to their namesake. A pant leg typically conceals them unless a character sports ankle holsters as a fashion statement while wearing shorts … and probably socks with sandals, but I digress. In fiction and reality, the ankle holster is best suited for a smaller secondary handgun (i.e., the “backup gun,” usually in a smaller caliber such as the .22 or .38). It’s also ideal for those who do a lot of sitting.
It takes practice and training to make a smooth draw from this type of holster, as well as the ability to bend down to the ankles. Bulkier characters who are unable to bend over to tie their shoes wouldn’t go with an ankle holster. But move that ankle holster up the leg, and it becomes a thigh holster that can be worn inside or outside the clothing.
Holsters for Women
Female characters can use any style holster, but a few holsters are specifically designed for them by taking advantage of accessories typically worn or carried by women.
New to the market in recent years are purse, brassiere, under-the-skirt (basically a re-tooled thigh holster), undershirt, and waistband holsters. Each is designed for concealed carry and is perfect for stealthy characters.
Ammunition Holsters
Characters would be wise to carry some spare ammunition. Fiction often doesn’t account for where this ammunition comes from, though. It just appears. Not so in real life.
For pistols, spare magazines can be kept in holsters or pouches separate from or built into the handgun holster. Products like the Snagmag allow for a magazine to be clipped into the inside of a pocket, sort of like a pen cap hooking into a notebook.
Magazines can also be kept loose in bags, pockets, and purses, but doing so isn’t always practical. Treat spare magazines like handguns in your writing. They need to be accessible and secure.
Speed loaders are always an option, but don’t forget about speed strips when writing a revolver reload. (Photo courtesy of Gun Digest.)
Spare revolver ammunition is a little trickier, since it doesn’t come in the convenient “ammo burrito” of a magazine. In that case, a few speed strips (a length of flexible material holding cartridges in a single-file line that can be thumbed into the chambers two or three at a time) in a pocket or pouch will do. Moon clips and speed loaders are other options, although they can be bulky and produce a bulge. Depending on the ego of the character, this might not be a bad thing.
Bandoliers, a strap lined with cartridges, are typically used for rifle or shotgun ammunition, although they could carry rounds for handguns, too. They can carry dozens of cartridges, but they’re heavy as a horse, so make sure the character wearing the bandolier is strong enough to do so.
Concealed Carry
This concealed carry section is small and comes at the end of the holster section. Why? Because holsters are a huge part of concealed carry and are as important as the handguns themselves.
Whenever a holstered handgun is hidden from view on a person, it’s considered concealed carry. There are special laws that regulate concealed carry. Read up on them in the section about must-know firearm laws later in part one.
It’s time for another example …
Inaccurate Example
Maynard Soloman yowled in pain as Bill Robber’s bullet tore through his right hand. He clutched the wound against his burly chest.
“Aw, nuts, that’s my gal-damn bingo blotter hand,” Maynard said. “How am I supposed to win that turkey dinner now? I’m no leftie.”
With the little dexterity that remained, Maynard stretched out his stubby arm and used his shredded hand to grab the revolver holstered to his right shoulder. He nailed Bill in the chest with two dead-on shots.
Accurate Example
Maynard Soloman yowled in pain as Bill Robber’s bullet tore through his right hand. He clutched the wound against his burly chest.
“Aw, nuts, that’s my gal-damn bingo blotter hand,” Maynard said. “How am I supposed to win that turkey dinner now? I’m no leftie.”
With the little dexterity that remained, Maynard stretched out his stubby arm and used his shredded hand to grab the revolver holstered to his right hip. He nailed Bill in the chest with a lucky shot.
What Went Wrong?
In the corrected example, Maynard holstered his revolver at the hip instead of his shoulder. This simple change solved two problems at once.
First is the issue of Maynard’s dimensions. He sports a burly chest and stubby arms. Thus, a shoulder holster is probably not a good choice for him. Replacing it with a hip holster remedies the situation. Always consider a character’s physical traits before assigning any piece of gear.
Second is the positioning of the shoulder holster. Since Maynard is right-handed, he’d strap the holster to his left shoulder, not his right. Again, the hip holster secured to his right side solves that problem.
One gray area concerns whether Maynard could successfully fire the revolver with a wounded hand. It’s not explicit in this example, but, as other sections of this guide reveal, Maynard is elderly. Firing a revolver with an uninjured hand is difficult enough. In this instance, I reduced the shots fired from two solid hits to a single lucky one. It goes to show that all weapons usage depends on the character’s condition. It’s something to consider every time a gun is fired or a knife is used.
