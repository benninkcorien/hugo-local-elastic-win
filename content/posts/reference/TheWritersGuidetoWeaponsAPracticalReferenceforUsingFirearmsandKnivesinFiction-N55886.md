Have a Question? Ask the Author, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
Have a Question? Ask the Author
Writers with specific questions about firearms and knives should go to CrimeFictionBook.com and contact me. The most common question I receive is, “What kind of gun/knife would a XYZ character from Such & Such use?” If I can’t answer it, I’ll find someone who can.
CrimeFictionBook.com includes the tips on firearms and knives that couldn’t fit in this guide. People tell me the free e-newsletter there is pretty keen, too.
I’m also on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and Goodreads, where I’m happy to talk guns, knives, writing, and all things fancy striking.
