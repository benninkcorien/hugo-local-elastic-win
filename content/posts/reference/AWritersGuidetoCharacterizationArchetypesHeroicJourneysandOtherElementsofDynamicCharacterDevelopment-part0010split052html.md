A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE ARTIST AND THE SEDUCTIVE MUSE
EMOTIONAL VS. PHYSICAL
SURVIVAL motivates the Artist, and SELF-ACTUALIZATION motivates the Seductive Muse. He needs to learn self-control and to distance himself from explosive situations. The Seductive Muse is very physical and probably should learn some self-control herself, so she’s not a great candidate to teach him. She wants to be recognized for her brains, not just her looks, but being so visually oriented the Artist can’t help but notice her looks.
The Artist loves to be around people who are in touch with their emotions, especially women. He loves to create works of art for himself and others. He is very intuitive, a visionary.
He may see the Seductive Muse as a wonderful playmate and confidant but he’s afraid she may leave him. Maybe he feels he’s not good enough for her. She understands him, and they can create beautiful works together. They operate on the same wavelength.
She’s not one to be the perfect stay-at-home wife. She may stay home but she’s no June Cleaver. The Seductive Muse sees the Artist as fun but a little too serious at times for her taste. She enjoys his company and loves a take-charge kind of guy, but his emotions may be too intense for her. He may get jealous.
