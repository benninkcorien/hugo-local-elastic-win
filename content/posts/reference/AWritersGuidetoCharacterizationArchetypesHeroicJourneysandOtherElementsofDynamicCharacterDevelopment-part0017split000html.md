A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
CHAPTER 11THE DEERINNOCENCE & AWARENESS
“Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn’t being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.” Animaltotem.com
When you see a deer, it’s hard not to notice how graceful and sensitive it is. Deer can hear the rustle of leaves under footsteps from very far away. They are able to perceive the type of animal that’s coming closer. They are always aware and observant of what’s going on around them because they are, after all, prey.
They need to be keenly observant and intuitive. They have the appearance of grace, sensitivity, caring, and going with the flow.
The deer teaches observers to hear what isn’t being said, that is, to read between the lines or hear below the surface. The deer demonstrates how to get an understanding of things that are not spoken, not demonstrated, and not brought to one’s attention.
In order to survive, they can’t be deep in their own minds, preoccupied with things that don’t concern with what’s going on around them. They have to pay attention, they must be present.
With most animals, some special awareness remains ever present, even in the playful times or when eating. Deer don’t have much in the way of protecting themselves (though males have antlers, they are only hard enough to use during the fall and early winter), but they do have gifts of instinct, intuition, and keen hearing. All of these things help them survive. As a group, its their Plan B. They always make sure they know a way out.
This lesson is about maintaining your innocence regardless of what circumstances you are facing. It’s about maintaining your inner spark throughout your life, rather than allowing what happens to harden you. (Citizen Kane is a great example of what happens when a person fails at this.)
It’s about seeing why things have happened the way they have and not giving up. It’s about dealing with things in an unusual way so that we don’t turn into the oppressor. The goals are to maintain your sense of self, that childlike (not childish) innocence and gentleness toward life and to always have a plan B in place to protect yourself.
I once went deer hunting with a bow and arrow. I didn’t know much about arrows or hunting but a friend invited me and I enjoy nature so I went. I remember sitting in the woods for hours, literally. I merely sat there in the quiet. I was unable to move because my friend was hunting and I couldn’t ruin things for him by making noise. It was very Zen-like to sit in complete silence, listening for that first snap of a twig, waiting and waiting. I was learning how to be aware of my surroundings. This is how deer live.
My friend didn’t shoot at anything that day, and I was so relieved—I’d rather look for deer and interact with them. Later he said he just goes for the quiet.
