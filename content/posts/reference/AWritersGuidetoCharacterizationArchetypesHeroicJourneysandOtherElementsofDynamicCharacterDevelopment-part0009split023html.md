A Writer’s Guide to Characterization
 THE WOMAN’S MAN AND THE MALE MESSIAH
EMOTIONAL VS. SPIRITUAL
While the Male Messiah gets along with everyone because he lives without judgment, these two archetypes still clash. The Woman’s Man is earthy and the Male Messiah is otherworldly. He is also a fighter, while the Woman’s Man is all lover.
The Male Messiah is very self-aware and knows he is not in touch with his body. His life is not for his own pleasure—he may live in joy but he has a mission to complete. He is in the world but not of it. The Woman’s Man enjoys the senses of life and all of life’s complexities, and would never think of giving them up.
The Male Messiah is always willing to help those around him; that is, if they can handle being helped. It is unlikely that anyone will change him. He can show the Woman’s Man what it means to find romantic love inside oneself rather than looking to others to make him feel less alone and more fulfilled.
