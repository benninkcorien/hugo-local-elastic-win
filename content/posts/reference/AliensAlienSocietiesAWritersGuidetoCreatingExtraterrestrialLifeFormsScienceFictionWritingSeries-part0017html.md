Book Title
A Xenologist's Bookshelf: References, Including Journals and Software
The following lists include all the references cited in the text, plus some others of general use to writers about aliens. In most cases the significance of an item listed will be evident from the reference (s) to it in the text. Occasionally I will add a comment in italics.
For convenience, I've divided my listings into four broad categories: Nonfiction, Fiction, Software and Miscellaneous Resources. Nonfiction includes both books and articles, alphabetized according to the first author's last name. In most cases I've listed the original publisher, but many books and stories have been reissued many times, sometimes by different publishers; so if you can't find the version listed here, check anthology indexes and Books in Print. I have not personally tested all the software listed, but all has been reported to me as useful by people whose opinions I value. “Miscellaneous Resources” includes everything that doesn't fit in the other categories, such as journals and conferences.
Since many items are mentioned in more than one chapter, I've used a single alphabetical listing for the entire book rather than separate listings for the individual chapters. I've also used some well-known short forms of long names, such as Analog for Analog Science Fiction and Fact.
A library is a good place to start looking for any of the references; but some may be hard to find. Many cities have bookstores specializing in used books and magazines. Analog (1540 Broadway, New York, NY 10036) can supply a list of dealers in used science fiction books and magazines if you send a stamped, self-addressed, legal-size envelope with your request.

SOFTWARE
Computer hardware and software change so fast that I can merely hint at the possibilities by describing a couple of programs that science fiction writers have found useful and directing you to some sources of such things.
PCSPACE, recommended to me by Robert R. Chase, enables you to “see” the night sky from any of 1,200 stars in its database. It's available from Andromeda Software, Inc. (P.O. Box 605, Amherst, NY 14226-0605), which also carries a large variety of scientific, astronomical and graphics software for IBM and compatibles.
Writer Daniel Hatch has developed his own program to “create planets from the protostellar nebula up, a whole solar system at a time.” It's written in GWBASIC and can be run on IBM and compatible computers, and comes with an article explaining how it works and how to use it. You can get a copy direct from the author by sending $10 to Daniel Hatch, P.O. Box 3315, Enfield, CT 06083.
The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (a nonprofit organization) periodically issues an updated list of astronomical software for computers of various makes, with a directory of vendors. According to my latest information, which I hope will still be correct when you read this, you can get a catalog by sending your name and address with two first-class stamps to A.S.P., Dept. CSP, 390 Ashton Ave., San Francisco, CA 94112.
MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES
Since all sciences change rapidly and good science fiction depends on up-to-date information, books aren't enough. The following journals are all good sources of reports on recent developments, and may well also suggest story ideas: National Geographic, Natural History, Nature, The New Scientist, Science, Science News and Scientific American.
Each October's issue of Scientific American is devoted to an in-depth examination of a broad theme by several authors prominent in their fields. The October, 1994 issue, on “Life in the Universe,” is of special interest to readers of this book.
The “Science Times” section in Tuesday editions of the New York Times, is a good source of preliminary information on very recent developments in many fields.
Many science fiction conventions include panels and workshops on creating worlds and aliens. A particularly good series of conferences devoted entirely to this subject has been conducted by the nonprofit organization CONTACT. For information write to CONTACT, Box 506, Capitola, CA 95010 (or e-mail terrel@cruzio. com.).
