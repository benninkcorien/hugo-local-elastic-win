True Crime Stories from Real Crime Writers, The Writer's Guide to Weapons
True Crime Stories from Real Crime Writers
Maynard Soloman, gal-damn detective, provided most of the examples in this guide. It’s time to give him a break before gangrene hits. Let’s shift to the real world.
What follows are true crime stories from real crime writers. Use their perspective for writing firearms and knives in fiction.
What It’s Like to Be Shot
Joseph Brennan, author of Superdollar, is a crime writer from Northern Ireland. During the Troubles of the 1970s, he became involved with the Irish Republicans, a group fighting with the Loyalists. He's since left that violence in the past.
British troops shot Brennan during an encounter in 1972. Here’s his description of how that felt. Note how the type of ammunition affected the injury.
I had nearly reached the end of the street and the safety of a corner when I believe that one of the soldiers realised that my gun was empty. The ground just to my left spat up at me as I heard the two high-velocity cracks a split second later. The next round spun past my head I heard it. I then stumbled as I ran, and it was then that I was hit.
If I had not stumbled when I did, I would most likely have died. My head jolted to the side and my shoulder went up and that’s when the round went through my shoulder. It was a minor explosion as blood and fibres from the padding in my jacket formed a crazy mist around the right side of my face.
I was aware of the pain but was somehow able to ignore it, if that makes sense. I also felt relief because I knew there and then I had survived it.
The impact of the bullet spun me round as I hit the ground, and I could see the soldier who had fired raise a clenched fist in triumph. He thought I was down. I rolled with the force and the momentum and got to the corner.
I ran for around three minutes through the maze of side streets before collapsing. I was still conscious, but my head was spinning and I could see the faces of the two men and a woman who picked me up and carried me to a Black Hackney Cab and safety.
In the end the wound was not so serious. The round hit me in the back about two or three inches from the top of my shoulder blade. … The entry wound was so neat and measured about one millimetre more than the 7.62mm [roughly equivalent to the .308 rifle caliber] of the round itself. The exit wound was less neat and around 20 millimetres and slightly oval shaped.
The doctor who treated me told me that if it had been a low-velocity round, things would have been more serious, as it would most likely have exploded upon hitting the bone. However, the full metal jacket round stayed intact and ploughed neatly on through.
What It’s Like to Be in a Gunfight
In his memoir, tentatively titled Adrenaline Junkie as of this writing, crime writer and Writer’s Digest Books author Les Edgerton recalls his wilder years running with rough crowds. Here’s his depiction of trading shots in a gunfight, as excerpted with permission from the memoir. Watch for how the encounter confused Les as he traded shots, unlike in the clear-cut action of fiction.
One night, cruising around back roads and stopping every so often to break into these country bars, which were everywhere around South Bend, Rat and I passed a junior high school stuck way out in the boonies south of town.
We’d never robbed a school before and didn’t know whether they kept money in the office, but it looked like an easy hit so we pulled in and broke into the front door. It was just Rat and me.
We were walking down the main hallway, big as shit, figuring we had all the time in the world since nobody’s going to be in a schoolhouse at 2 A.M., when all of a sudden somebody at the other end of the corridor jumped out and fired a shot at us. It sounded like a cannon going off in that empty school.
Rat and I each jumped into a room on either side of the hallway and yanked our pieces out and started firing at the other end where the gunfire had come from. We were whispering back and forth, and came up with this master plan that we would trade fire with the cops—that’s what we figured they were—and then we’d run for the car and try and outrun them. I had my T-Bird then and there wasn’t much could catch it.
We’d each shot four or five shots and were just about to make our break when this voice yelled, “We give up!” I looked over at Rat and he at me and I said, “Cops don’t give themselves up, do they?” He started laughing and said, “Fuck no.”
“You cops?” we both yelled down the hall.
“No!” came a voice back. “Are you?”
It was two other guys with the same idea who had broken into the other end at about the same time we had.
We talked to each other a few minutes, and then Rat and I said we were going to get the hell out of there. Even though the school was way out in the boonies we figured maybe some farmer had heard the shots and might be calling the cops. The other two guys said they were going to go ahead and check it out, see if there was any money. Rat and I got in my car and booked. I don’t know whether those other guys ever got busted or not. I didn’t buy newspapers in those days, and we didn’t have a TV. I hope they made it. They seemed like nice guys once they “gave up."
In an e-mail, Edgerton said, “Rat had one of those pesky little Raven .25 calibers, and I had a .38 revolver. I kept telling him to get rid of that little toy. If he ever shot anyone with it, it was just going to piss them off, plus it left [empty casings] lying around.”
What It’s Like to Be in a Knife Fight
The colorful stories from Edgerton’s memoir keep coming. Here’s an example involving a fight with a switchblade.
Note how the blade doesn’t stand up to the rigors of the melee. Despite the way they’re depicted in fiction, switchblades can’t take a lot of abuse. Fixed blade knives, modern assisted opening knives, and even standard folding knives benefit from better designs and technology.
Also pay attention to Rachelle’s reaction after getting stabbed. She had no idea it had happened.
Rachelle was so tiny I knew she wasn’t any match for Cat. If Rachelle topped the scales at 90 pounds I’d be surprised. I ran back to the stairs, took them two at a time, and flew around the corner of the building to the lot. Just as I came around the corner, I saw Cat raise her arm and smack Rachelle, who ducked, catching the blow on her back.
I ran as fast as I could, arriving there just as Cat was raising her arm to strike again, and that was when I saw she had the switchblade in her hand. She’d already stabbed her once, but neither Rachelle nor I realized that at this point.
As Cat was coming down with the knife, I grabbed her wrist with one hand and Rachelle with the other and shoved them apart as hard as I could. Cat went down on her hands and knees, then snarled and lunged at me, trying to catch me in my stomach with the knife. I ducked and at the same time grabbed her hand as it was coming across and smashed it as hard as I could on my knee, which made her lose control, and the knife clattered to the pavement.
My first thought was to find the knife before she did, that without it she couldn’t do much damage. It was pitch-black, so it took a few seconds before I felt it with my foot.
When Cat saw I had the knife in my hand, she snarled and took off running for the other parking lot, cutting back through the pool area. I stood there with the knife in my hand until I heard her car start and squeal out of the lot. I tried to fold it, but the blade was bent in two places and wouldn’t go back.
I walked over to Rachelle, who was standing up against her car. She looked all right, but I wanted to be sure.
“You okay?” I asked.
“I think so,” she said. Just then, I noticed tiny speckles of bright crimson all over her white silk blouse. It looked like sprinkles of Tabasco sauce.
“Oh, man,” I said. “She hit you in the nose. You’ve got a nose bleed.”
I’m standing there, the knife in my hand, I’ve just seen Cat hit her with it the instant before I could get there, Cat had tried to disembowel me … and it still didn’t dawn on me that she’d stabbed Rachelle. It hadn’t dawned on Rachelle either. It just all happened too fast, and I’d guess we were both in shock.
“No,” she said. “She didn’t hit me in the nose. I ducked, and she hit me in the back.”
“Turn around,” I said.
The entire back of her blouse was solid red, and a crimson stain was spreading down her white pants.
“Jesus,” I said. “You’ve been stabbed.”
“I have?” Rachelle said.
“Yeah. Can you walk?”
She could. We walked over to the pool area, which was better lit. I slipped down her blouse a little to see the puncture. Blood had quit running except for little dribbles that came out when she moved, kind of bubbly stuff.
“You need to go to the hospital,” I said.
“No,” she said. “I’ll be all right. I’ll just go home and have my mom look at it. I don’t think it’s that bad."
Just then, a guy came through the breezeway from the far parking lot. I called out to him.
“Hey! I’ve got a girl here who’s been stabbed. You know if there’s a doctor in the complex?” That was a stupid question. I lived in Drug Central, home of drug dealers and prostitutes and house creepers. And me.
He came over.
“Man!” he said when he saw all the blood. “I think the lady that lives there is a nurse,” he said. He pointed to a ground-floor apartment on the other side of the pool from where we stood. I left Rachelle and ran over and knocked and knocked, but no one came to the door. I went back to Rachelle, and she said, “I’m starting to feel a little dizzy. Let’s go up to your room where the light’s good so you can take a better look at it.”
I held her elbow and we walked up the stairs and down the walk to my apartment, and once inside I removed her blouse. Not much blood was coming out by now. It was just bubbling a little when her muscles flexed, but her entire back was covered with sticky-tacky, drying blood.
Imitating Hollywood Could Get Someone Killed
Fiction sometimes depicts knives or guns being shot out of hands. As this story from retired law enforcement officer and writer Leroy Vaughn details, doing so is difficult. Here’s his story about “Glen,” a fellow officer, in an encounter with a machete-wielding man. It was originally published in the online ’zine Fingerprints (fingerprintsjournal.blogspot.com).
Pay attention to how hard it is to hit anything with a handgun, even for a police officer.
Glen was one of those cops who wanted to be a peace officer. He was going to do everything he could to get the little man to drop the machete. He asked the man several times to put the weapon down and place his hands on his head. He wasn’t sure the man could understand him, but he knew that pointing a pistol at him would get his point across.
The man screamed, and Glen assumed that the man was cussing at him, but the man could not or would not speak English. The man was now less than seven feet from Glen. Glen knew he had no choice. He was going to have to shoot the man to stop him, or Glen would be dead.
Glen was a big fan of cowboy movies, and he thought that at that distance he could shoot the machete out of the man’s right hand. The man started to swing the machete as he moved closer. Glen fired one round from his .38 revolver at the man’s hand.
Glen was surprised when the man went down. Glen kicked the machete out of the man’s hand as he lay bleeding on the sawdust covered floor. Glen bent down to check the man as the bartender came over to look at the man on the floor. Glen looked at the bartender and told him the man was dead, having felt for a pulse on the man’s carotid artery.
“Where did you hit him? I thought you went for his hand,” I told him as he lit another cigarette. “I did aim for the hand, but I was the worst shot in my class at the academy. I couldn’t hit an elephant with a bazooka. There was a coroner’s inquest the next week, and I was told that I had shot him right through the heart."
