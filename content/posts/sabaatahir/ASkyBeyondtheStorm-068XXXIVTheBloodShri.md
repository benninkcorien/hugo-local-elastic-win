XXXIV: The Blood Shrike, A Sky Beyond the Storm
XXXIV: The Blood Shrike
As we enter the city, a horn wails. A Karkaun warning call, rousing   them from sleep and drink and less savory entertainments. In minutes, the sound echoes across the city.
“Teluman.” At my summons, the smith looms out of the night, a group of twenty men behind him.
“After you secure the drum towers,” I tell him, “get to the southeast barracks, in the Mercator Quarter. A good part of their army is there. Burn it down.”
“Consider it done, Shrike.” Teluman moves off, and I turn to Mettias.
I’m heartened to see that though the thud of Karkaun boots closes in on us, the young Pater is unfazed. He’d have made a good Mask.
“Make sure those weapons get to every Martial and Scholar willing to fight,” I say. “Get the word out to hold the attack until Teluman sounds the drums. Musa, send a wight to Quin. When he gets through, he needs to bring his forces to Cardium Rock.”
“Shrike,” Harper protests, for this is not part of the plan. “Grímarr is too well-protected. He’ll have the bulk of his men up there. He’s luring you to him.”
“You are a man of few words, Harper.” I signal to my men, and we move away from the walls. “So don’t waste the ones you do utter on things I already know. He needs to die. And I’m the one who is going to kill him.”
Harper looks taken aback, and then laughs. “Sorry, Shrike.”
Musa, Harper, and my last thirty men are behind me as we weave through streets we know better than any Karkaun. We leave weapons throughout the city, passing through a prearranged system of alleys and courtyards and homes. Everywhere, the Martials and Scholars of Antium thump their fists to their hearts in salute.
Eleventh bell tolls. We approach the Hall of Records, a building as massive as Blackcliff’s amphitheater. The hall’s roof, carved with sculptures of Taius’s victories, is held up by stone columns as wide around as trees in the Waiting Place.
We enter, making our way across a thick layer of ash from the fire that burned here when the hall was hit by a Karkaun projectile. A stone statue of Taius lies on its side, the head broken off and half-buried beneath scattered scrolls and shattered masonry.
The Hall of Records takes up one entire side of Cartus Square. Palace outbuildings line another side, and shops and businesses the third. The last side is taken up by a jumble of rock that leads to a vast bone pit. A scarred granite cliff stretches above the pit and at its top—Cardium Rock, where a dozen massive bonfires light up the sky.
As I send men out into the square to kill off any guards, Musa comes to squat beside me.
“Spiro ran into trouble. He’s battling a Karkaun force at one of the drum towers.” Musa pauses. “Three hundred men.”
Bleeding, burning hells. At that moment, Harper, who slipped ahead to scout, returns.
“The palace entrance to the Rock is blocked by thousands of Karkauns,” he says. “They’re bringing prisoners out from the dungeons and—” Disgust ripples across Harper’s silver face. I move forward to get a better view of the Rock, only to see prisoners being shoved off the top and into the bone pit a hundred feet below.
“How fast can you get our men changed into the stinking furs the barbarians wear?” I ask Harper.
“Before you get up that cliff, Shrike.”
“Get to the top of the Rock, hide among the Karkauns, and wait for my signal. When the time is right, raise the hells. And—”
He meets my eyes, his own burning with battle rage. I want to tell him to be careful. To take no foolish risks. To survive. But such sentiment has no place in war.
“Don’t fail me,” I tell him, and turn away.
It is the work of a few moments to flit across the square. Once I reach the pit, I mutter a curse. I thought I could swing a grappling hook up from the furthermost edge of it, but it is too broad.
Which means I must cross it. I must make my way over the skulls and bones and bodies of the dead.
You are all that holds back the darkness. My father spoke so to me, more than a year ago now. I do not think any longer. I simply move, dropping down into the pit.
Bones crunch as I land, and soft flesh bursts. I retch from the stench, and the darkness is something out of a nightmare.
It lasts so long. The pit is a hundred yards wide, but it might as well be a continent. For as I make my way over the dead, I hear things.
Moans.
Ghosts! my mind screams. But it is not ghosts. It is something far worse. It is those men who survived the fall. I want to find them. To grant them mercy in this hellish place. But there are too many and I have no time. Teluman has not yet sounded the drums. For all I know, he and his men could be dead, our attack over before it even started.
Defeat in your mind is defeat on the battlefield!
A lifetime passes as I walk across the pit, over the rotting flesh of the dead. I know I will never speak of these moments to anyone. For they have changed something inside irrevocably. If I do not kill Grímarr at the end of this, this will be where I die too, and I will deserve it, because I did not avenge the injustice done to all those whom I tread upon now.
Finally, I reach the cliff. It is rugged and will be difficult to traverse. My eyes adjust to the darkness as much as they can, and I can just make out crags and pits in the rock face that I can use to pull myself up.
I unsheathe my knives, dig them into the rock, and climb. The world below falls away. I still bear the scar of Grímarr’s bite. A half-moon-shaped reminder that he sunk his jaws into my city, my people, and sucked them dry. I quench the idea of death and think of how it will feel to hold that bastard’s neck in my hands. Of how it will feel to break it.
Foot by agonizing foot, I climb. By the time I approach the top, I am covered in sweat and panting, every muscle screaming. I drag myself the final few inches, taking in deep draughts of air as I peer over the edge.
Cardium Rock is shaped like a wedge with a flat tip. The narrowest point, where I am, is thirty feet wide, and the broadest is a hundred. At its far edge are three terraced levels for viewers to watch the executions that usually take place here.
Right now, the terraces are filled with Karkauns. Grímarr, meanwhile, is just steps away.
He is naked but for a loincloth, his pale body drenched in blood. He gibbers maniacally—Ik tachk mort fid iniqant fi!—as the air around him quivers. The skin where I severed his left arm is pink and scarred, as if he’s had months to heal instead of a fortnight.
Which means that even if he hasn’t been able to raise ghosts, he has other magic at his disposal.
A bonfire burns behind him, ringed with guards. As I calculate whether there are enough to be a real threat, the drums thunder out with such force that I nearly lose my grip on the knives holding me in place.
North tower for the rightful emperor. Attack.
East tower for the rightful emperor. Attack.
West tower for the rightful emperor. Attack.
A cry rises up, one voice joined by a dozen, then a hundred, then thousands. It is not a cry of sadness or defeat, but of fury and vengeance. Across Antium, the women and children and wounded and elderly who have been at the mercy of the Karkauns take up arms. It is a blood-stirring sound. The sound of impending victory.
I close my eyes and remember Antium falling. Remember my men, possessed by ghosts, killing their own people. I think of Madam Heera, and the weeping from the brothels.
Loyal to the end.
I vault upward and tear off my hood.
“Grímarr!” I bellow his name, flinging three throwing knives at him. But he moves with unnatural swiftness to evade them. Without turning to face me, he laughs, an uncanny cackle.
“Blood Shrike,” he says. “At last.”
His men approach, but I spit at his feet, cut my hand, and let the blood drip to the stones of Cardium Rock.
“I challenge thee, Grímarr.” My voice carries over the bonfires and up the terraces. “To battle with no steel and no stone, no blades and no bows. Until one of us lies dead.”
I cast my scim to the ground, along with the knife belt at my waist.
“To the death.” Grímarr turns, grinning, his eyes the pure white of a man possessed. Ten hells. Somehow, the Karkaun warlock has managed to harness a ghost.
“Come then, girl.” His voice sounds like one overlaid against another, an eerie echo. “Come to your doom, for with your soul I shall open a door into the hells.”
The Karkauns holler in excitement. Grímarr’s guards keep their hands on their weapons but step back. The challenge has been accepted.
I ignore the warlock’s blathering and focus on how I’m going to beat him. Ghosts lend humans impossible strength. If Grímarr gets his hands on me, I’m dead.
He drops into a sort of half crouch, preparing to leap. He is taller than me—wider and heavier too. But the ghost possessing him makes him preternaturally quick. I dart forward, landing two hard jabs on his chest and a kick to his windpipe.
A normal man would stagger. He shrugs off the blows and snatches at my leg when it’s still flying through the air. I whip it out of the way with only inches to spare.
I dart around the bonfire, and he dives for me, hitting me in the stomach so hard that I nearly retch. I elbow him in the eyeball, grimacing as it squelches. When he howls in pain, I escape his grasp yet again. This time, I edge toward the cliff, watching it carefully, allowing myself to get closer to it. Grímarr narrows his eyes and backs away, understanding my intent.
It appears as if he is retreating from me. Beyond the bonfire, his men jeer at him. An angry snarl forms on his milk-white face. He speeds forward, impossibly fast. I have only a moment to crouch and barrel into his legs as fast as I can in the hopes that he’ll roll over me and into the pit.
He simply leaps over me. In seconds, he will tackle me and break my neck or spine or both. I spin out of my crouch and swipe up my knife belt, still lying near the bonfire. When I turn, he is there, foam flecking his mouth, eyes that uncanny white.
He is too strong. I will never beat him in hand-to-hand combat. And as a Martial, I don’t bleeding care. War has rules—this monster followed none of them. Saving the people of Antium means I must choose between honor and victory. Without hesitation, I choose victory.
He sees the blade too late. I plunge it into his heart, rip it out, and plunge it in again, and again and again.
He should not be able to speak. But the ghost in him rages. “Karkaun—challenge—” he rasps. “No—steel—”
“I’m not a Karkaun.” I kick up my scim from where it rests near my feet and swing it at his neck. He blocks the attack, the ghost in him lending him strength when he should be bleeding out, and I dance away from him.
“You think—you will win,” he whispers, and now he weaves, having lost too much blood.
“This is my city. And as long as I have breath left in my body, I will fight for it.”
“Cities.” He drops to his knees. “Cities are nothing. I am nothing. You are nothing. Ik tachk mort fid iniqant fi.”
His shoulders sag, and when I whip my scim across to take off his head, he cannot stop me. Blood geysers over me as I kick his twitching body off the cliff, dig my fingers into his hair, and hold up his severed head.
“This is your leader?” I turn to his men. “This is the man you called king?”
For a seemingly unending moment, the Karkauns are silent. The city is filled with the sounds of battle, and in the distance, the lockstep thud of boots echoes. Quin!
Come on, Harper, I think. If ever there was a clearer signal than this . . .
A cry of victory goes up from the Martial prisoners still being marched through the Karkaun crowd, and all the hells break loose. It begins at the back of the Karkaun throng, but my men move quickly. Fights break out, and the Karkauns shout, grasping for their weapons, realizing that the enemy is among them.
I tear another knife from my belt and plunge into the fray. All of my hate, all of my frustration, every sleepless night during which I raged against my own inaction pours out of me.
When the Martial prisoners realize what is happening, they fight too, chains and all. Without Grímarr to lead them and without the ghosts to lend them strength, the Karkauns panic, stabbing and slashing indiscriminately. As they die at the edge of my blades, I hear the phrase Grímarr uttered. Ik tachk mort fid iniqant fi.
Within the crowd of Karkauns, a squad of my men fight their way toward me, Musa among them. I try to join them, but the Karkauns surround us. Musa disappears, his scims flying, and I remind myself to ask him who the hells trained him before I am inundated by the enemy again.
Soon enough, the sheer number of Karkauns grows overwhelming. Even with the prisoners fighting, we are heavily outnumbered.
I spot raven-black hair and brown skin. Harper appears beside me, blood-spattered and snarling, tearing into the Karkauns with a savagery that matches my own. Kill by kill, we press the barbarians back.
Until a knot of them comes between us. One of Harper’s scims goes flying. I hear the crunch of fist against bone. A Karkaun dagger flashes high and blood geysers in the air.
One second, Harper is there. The next he is not. As I fight, I wait to see him, wait for him to stand up. But he doesn’t.
My mind goes horribly blank. I scream and battle through the Karkauns closest to me, heart thundering in terror. It wasn’t his blood. He’d have blocked that attack easily. No. No. No. I should have ordered him to stay in Delphinium. I should have had him accompany Quin. I shouldn’t have tried to take back Antium, not if this was the cost.
And now—now—
Dead. This cannot be. Harper cannot be dead. For I did not say any of what I should have. I did not touch him or kiss him or tell him that without him, I never would have survived this long. Dead like Father and Mother and Hannah and Faris and all those who you love—
Suddenly, he is charging through the Karkauns and beside me once more, limping but alive. I grab his arm, ensuring that he’s real, and he glances up in surprise.
“You—” Bleeding hells, I think I am crying. No. It’s sweat. It must be. “You’re—”
His eyes shift to whatever is behind me. He shoves me aside and impales a Karkaun on the end of his scim. From the south, the drums thunder again.
Enemy retreat, southern quadrant. The news gives my fighters and the prisoners new heart. A group of Karkauns, those closest to the palace, breaks away, running for their lives.
Harper grins and turns to me as more and more flee from Cardium Rock. “They’re running!”
I nod, but I can hardly muster a smile back. My chest is still tight from seeing him go under, from the fear that grabbed hold of me like a mailed fist, when I thought he was gone.
The rhythmic march of Martial soldiers grows louder, and even as we follow the fleeing Karkauns, I spot white hair and the sigil of Gens Veturia. I move toward Quin quickly—anything to get away from the thoughts in my head.
“Ten hells, old man.” I clap him on the back. “It took you long enough.”
He surveys the Karkauns. “Seems like you have it well in hand. Shall we send them crawling back to their holes?”
The night is bloody, but the Karkauns are nothing without their alpha. Those who fight are quickly destroyed. The rest simply run, escaping the city like rats from a ship on fire.
“Get a message to the southern Paters,” I tell Harper. “Tell them those loyal to Emperor Zacharias liberated Antium this day.”
Dawn brightens the eastern horizon, and my men gather on a staircase in Cartus Square. Quin hoists Zacharias’s hawk-and-hammer flag atop the palace.
As he does, Antium’s survivors emerge into the streets. Emaciated Martial and Scholar men, chained but unbroken. Women clutching weapons in one hand and children in the other. Fighters all.
The square fills up, and then the streets. I spot Neera in the crowd, and a chant starts up, one that is spoken and whispered at first. Then shouted by all of those who fought for Antium, by all who survived.
“Imperator Invictus! Imperator Invictus!”
My blood surges when I hear it. First in pride. Then in dawning unease.
For they are not chanting for Zacharias.
They are chanting for me.
“They should be chanting the Emperor’s name,” I hiss at Quin, who has descended and stands beside me on the stairs. “Not—this.”
“The Emperor is a child, Shrike. A symbol. You are the general who fought for them. You understood the strength of their spirit. And you were fearless. Let them call you whatever they please.”
My mind snags on one word: Fearless. For I am not fearless. To be fearless means to have a heart of steel. But my heart betrayed itself. It is soft and hopeful.
And I know now that it belongs entirely to Avitas Harper. No matter how I wish to deny it, my reaction when I thought him dead tells me I am fully, foolishly in love with him. He is the weak spot in my armor, the flaw in my defense.
Damn my traitorous heart to the hells.
