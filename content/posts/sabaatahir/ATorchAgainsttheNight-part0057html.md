A Torch Against the Night
CHAPTER FIFTY
Helene
Avitas and I arrive in Antium just as Rathana dawns. As our horses clatter through the city gates, stars still glint above and sunrise has not yet graced the jagged mountains to the east of the city.
Though Avitas and I scoped out the land around the capital, we saw no sign of an army. But the Commandant is clever. She might have slipped her forces into the city and hidden them in multiple places. Or she might be waiting until nightfall to unleash her attack.
Faris and Dex join up with us as we enter the city, having spotted our approach from one of the watchtowers.
“Hail, Shrike.” Dex clasps my hand as he steers his horse to fall in with mine. He looks like he hasn’t slept in a year. “The Masks of the Black Guard are deployed and await your orders. I had three squads secure the Emperor. Another squad is out scouting for the army. The rest have taken over the city guard.”
“Thank you, Dex.” I am relieved he doesn’t question me about Elias. “Faris,” I say. “Report.”
“The girl was right,” my big friend says. We weave through the wagons, men, and animals entering Antium at this early hour. “There is an army. At least four thousand men—”
“It’s the Commandant’s,” I say. “Harper can explain.” When we clear the traffic, I kick my horse into a gallop. “Think carefully about what you saw,” I call to Faris. “I need you to bear witness before the Emperor.”
The streets are starting to fill with Mercators out early to stake out the best spots for the festivities of Rathana. A Plebeian ale merchant trundles through the city with extra barrels of his goods to supply to the taverns. Children hang up blue and green lanterns that symbolize the day. Everyone seems so normal. Happy. Still, they clear the way when they see four Black Guards galloping through the streets. When we reach the palace, I leap off my horse, nearly mowing down the groom who comes to take the reins.
“Where is the Emperor?” I snap at a legionnaire on gate duty.
“In the throne room, Shrike, with the rest of the court.”
As I hoped. The leaders of the Empire’s Illustrian Gens are early risers, particularly when they want something. They’ll have begun lining up to petition the Emperor hours ago. The throne room will be packed with powerful men, men who can bear witness to the fact that I saved the throne from the Commandant’s predations.
I have spent days planning my speech, and as we approach the throne room, I go over it again in my head. The two legionnaires guarding the throne room doors attempt to announce me, but Dex and Faris step ahead of me, shove them out of the way, and open the doors for me. It’s like having two walking battering rams at my side.
Black Guard soldiers line the room at intervals, most standing between the colossal tapestries that depict the deeds of past Emperors. As I make for the throne, I spot Lieutenant Sergius, the Black Guard who was stupid enough to address me as Miss Aquilla the last time I was here. He salutes respectfully as I pass.
Faces turn toward me. I recognize the Paters of a few dozen Mercator and Illustrian Gens. Through the enormous glass ceiling, the last stars give way to daylight.
Marcus sits on the ornately carved ebony throne, his usual sneer replaced by a look of cold wrath as he listens to a report from a courier who looks fresh from the road. A circlet of sharp points, patterned with Blackcliff’s four-sided diamond, adorns his head.
“—pushed past the border and are harassing the villages outside Tiborum. The city will be overrun if we do not get men out there immediately, my lord.”
“Blood Shrike.” Marcus notices me and waves off the legionnaire giving his report. “It is good to lay eyes upon you again.” He flicks his glance up and down my form but then grimaces and puts a finger to his temple. I am relieved when he looks away.
“Pater Aquillus,” he says through gritted teeth. “Come and greet your daughter.”
My father emerges from the rows of courtiers, my mother and sisters trailing. Hannah wrinkles her nose when she sees me, as if she’s smelled something foul. My mother nods a greeting, her knuckles white as she clasps her hands in front of her. She looks too afraid to speak. Livvy manages a smile when she sees me, but I’d have to be a fool not to notice that she’s been crying.
“Greetings, Blood Shrike.” Father’s pained glance takes in Avitas, Faris, and Dex before returning to me. No Elias, he seems to say. I give him a reassuring nod, trying to communicate with my eyes. Do not fear, Father.
“Your family has been kind enough to grace me with their presence daily since you left.” Marcus’s mouth curves into a smile before he pointedly looks behind me. “You’ve returned empty-handed, Shrike.”
“Not empty-handed, Emperor,” I say. “I come bearing something far more important than Elias Veturius. As we speak, an army marches on Antium, lead by Keris Veturia. For months, she has siphoned off soldiers from the Tribal lands and the border regions to create this treasonous army. That is why you’re getting reports of Wildmen and Barbarians attacking our outlying cities.” I nod to the courier. He backs away, not wanting to get involved in any discussion between the Blood Shrike and the Emperor. “The Commandant means to launch a coup.”
Marcus cocks his head. “And you have proof of this supposed army?”
“I saw it, my lord,” Faris rumbles from beside me. “Not two days ago, in the Argent Hills. Couldn’t get close enough to recognize the Gens represented, but there were at least twenty standards flying.” The Empire supports 250 Illustrian Gens. That the Commandant could muster the support of so many gets Marcus’s attention. He tightens a big fist on his throne.
“Your Majesty,” I say. “I dispatched the Black Guard to take control of Antium’s walls and to scout beyond the city. The Commandant will likely attack tonight, so we still have a full day to prepare the city. But we must get you to a safe loca—”
“So you did not bring me Elias Veturius?”
Here goes. “My lord, it was either bring Veturius back or report this coup. Time did not allow both. I thought the security of the Empire mattered more than one man.”
Marcus regards me for a long moment before his gaze shifts to something behind me. I hear a familiar, hated gait, the thunk-thunk of steel-bottomed boots.
Impossible. I left before she did. I rode without stopping. She might have reached her army before us, but we would have seen her if she was headed to Antium. There are only so many roads that lead here from Kauf.
A slice of darkness in the recesses of the throne room catches my attention: a hood with suns glaring out from within. A swish of a cloak and he’s gone. The Nightbringer. The jinn. He brought her here.
“I told you, Emperor.” The Commandant’s voice is smooth as a snake’s coils. “The girl is deluded by her obsession with Elias Veturius. Her inability—or unwillingness—to catch him has led her to concoct this ridiculous story—and to deploy valuable members of the Black Guard in a haphazard and senseless way. An ostentatious move. No doubt she’s hoping that it will support her claim. She must think us fools.”
The Commandant circles me to stand beside Marcus. Her body is calm, her features unruffled, but when she meets my eyes, my throat goes dry at her fury. If I were at Blackcliff I’d be sagging from the whipping post right about now, breathing my last.
What in the bleeding skies is she doing here? She should be with her army right now. I eye the room again, expecting to see her men pour in through the doors at any moment. But though I see Gens Veturia soldiers throughout the throne room, they don’t look as if they’re readying themselves for battle.
“According to the Commandant, Blood Shrike,” Marcus says, “Elias Veturius managed to get stuck in Kauf Prison. But you knew that, didn’t you?”
He’ll know if I lie. I bow my head. “I did, Your Majesty. But—”
“Yet you didn’t bring him with you. Though he likely would have been dead by now anyway. Is that correct, Keris?”
“It is, Your Majesty. The boy was poisoned somewhere on his journey,” the Commandant says. “The Warden reports that he has been having seizures for weeks. The last I heard, Elias Veturius was a few hours from death.”
Seizures? When I saw Elias in Nur, he looked ill, but I assumed it was because of a hard march from Serra.
Then I remember what he said—words that made no sense at the time but that now send a knife through my gut: We both know I’m not long for this world.
And the Warden, after I told him I’d see Elias again: Callow is the hope of our youth. Behind me, Avitas takes a sharp breath.
“The Nightweed she gave me, Shrike,” he whispers. “She must have had enough to use it on him.”
“You”—I turn to the Commandant, and everything falls together—“you poisoned him. But you must have done it weeks ago, when I found your tracks in Serra. When you fought him.” Is my friend dead, then? Truly dead? No. He can’t be. My mind will not accept it.
“You used Nightweed because you knew it would take him a long time to die. You knew I’d hunt him. And as long as I was out of your way, I wouldn’t be able to stop your coup.” Bleeding skies. She killed her own son—and she’s been playing me for months.
“Nightweed is illegal in the Empire, as everyone here knows.” The Commandant looks at me like I’m covered in dung. “Listen to yourself, Shrike. To think that you trained at my school. I must have been blind to let a novice like you graduate.”
The throne room buzzes, going silent when I step toward her. “If I’m such a fool,” I say, “then explain why every garrison in the Empire is undermanned. Why didn’t you ever have enough soldiers? Why aren’t there enough on the borders?”
“I needed men to quell the revolution, of course,” she says. “The Emperor himself gave those transfer orders.”
“But you kept asking for more—”
“This is embarrassing to watch.” The Commandant turns to Marcus. “I am ashamed, my lord, that Blackcliff produced someone so weak-minded.”
“She’s lying,” I say to Marcus, but I can well imagine how I must sound—tense and shrill against the Commandant’s cool defense. “Your Majesty, you must believe me—”
“Enough.” Marcus speaks in a voice that silences the entire room. “I gave you an order to bring in Elias Veturius, alive, by Rathana, Blood Shrike. You failed to carry out that order. Everyone in this room heard what the punishment for your failure would be.” He nods to the Commandant, and she signals her troops.
In seconds, the men of Gens Veturia step forward and seize my parents, my sisters.
I find that my hands and feet have gone numb. It’s not supposed to be like this. I’m being true to the Empire. I’m holding my fealty.
“I promised the Paters of our great families an execution,” Marcus says. “And unlike you, Blood Shrike, I mean to keep my vow.”
