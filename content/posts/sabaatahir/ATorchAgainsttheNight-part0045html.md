A Torch Against the Night
CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE
Helene
The voices on the wind wrap around me, sending jolts of unease down to my core. Kauf Prison, still two miles distant, makes its presence known through the pain of its inmates.
“About bleeding time.” Faris, waiting at the supply outpost outside the valley, emerges from within. He pulls his fur-lined cloak close, gritting his teeth at the freezing wind. “I’ve been here three days, Shrike.”
“There was flooding in the Argent Hills.” A trip that should have taken seven days instead took more than a fortnight. Rathana is little more than a week away. No bleeding time. I hope my trust in the Cook was not misplaced.
“The soldiers at the garrison there insisted we go around,” I explain to Faris. “Ten hells of a delay.”
Faris takes the reins of my horse as I swing down. “Strange,” he said. “The Hills were blocked off on the east side too, but they told me mudslide.”
“Mudslide because of the flooding, likely. Let’s eat, stock up, and start tracking Veturius.”
A blast of warm air from the roaring hearth hits us as we enter the outpost, and I take a seat beside the fire as Faris speaks quietly to the four auxes hovering. As one, they nod vigorously at whatever he’s saying, casting nervous glances in my direction. Two disappear into the kitchens while the other two tend to the horses.
“What did you tell them?” I ask Faris.
“That you’d purge their families if they spoke of our presence to anyone.” Faris grins at me. “I assume you don’t want the Warden to know we’re here.”
“Good thinking.” I hope we do not need the Warden’s aid in tracking Elias. I shudder to think what he’d want in trade.
“We need to scout the area,” I say. “If Elias is here, he might not have gone in yet.”
Faris’s breathing hitches and then continues as before. I glance at him, and he appears suddenly and deeply interested in his meal.
“What is it?”
“Nothing.” Faris speaks far too quickly and mutters a curse when he realizes that I’ve noticed. He sets down his plate.
“I hate this,” he says. “And I don’t care if the Commandant’s spy knows.” He gives Avitas a dark look. “I hate that we’re like dogs hunting a kill, with Marcus cracking his whip at our backs. Elias saved my life during the Trials. And Dex’s too. He knew what it felt like … after …” Faris looks at me accusingly. “You’ve never even spoken of the Third Trial.”
With Avitas watching my every move, the wise path would be to give a speech about loyalty to the Empire right now.
But I am too tired. And too sick at heart.
“I hate it too.” I look down at my half-eaten food, my appetite gone. “Bleeding skies, I hate everything about it. But this isn’t about Marcus. It’s about the survival of the Empire. If you can’t bring yourself to help, then pack your things and go back to Antium. I can assign you to another mission.”
Faris looks away, jaw clenched. “I’ll stay.”
Quietly, I release a sigh. “In that case”—I pick up my fork again—“maybe you can tell me why you clammed up when I said we should scout the area for Elias.”
Faris groans. “Damn it, Hel.”
“You were stationed at Kauf at the same time as him, Lieutenant Candelan,” Avitas says to Faris. “You, Shrike, were not.”
True—Elias and I ended up at Kauf at different times when we were Fivers.
“Did he go somewhere when things in the prison were too much?” There’s an intensity to Avitas that I’ve rarely seen. “An … escape?”
“A cave,” Faris says after a moment. “I followed him once when he left Kauf. I thought—skies, I don’t know what I thought. Probably something stupid: that he’d found a hidden stash of ale in the woods. But he just sat inside and stared at the walls. I think … I think he was trying to forget the prison.”
A great emptiness opens up inside me when Faris says it. Of course Elias would find such a place. He wouldn’t be able to bear Kauf without it. It’s so like him that I want to laugh and break something at the same time.
Not now. Not when you’re so close.
“Take us there.”
«««
At first, I think the cave is a dead end. It looks as if it’s been abandoned for years. But we light torches anyway and search every inch of it. Just as I’m about to order us to move out, I catch a glimpse of something glimmering deep within a crack in the wall. When I go to pull it out, I nearly drop it.
“Ten hells.” Faris grabs the bound, crossed scabbards from me. “Elias’s scims.”
“He’s here.” I ignore the dread pooling in my stomach—you’ll have to kill him!—and pretend it is the adrenaline rush of a hunt. “And recently. The spiders have covered everything else.” I hold up a torch to the webs in the crack.
I look about for signs of the girl. Nothing. “If he’s here, then Laia should be too.”
“And,” Avitas adds, “if he left all of this here, he can’t have believed he’d be gone for long.”
“You’re on watch,” I say to Faris. “Remember, this is Veturius we’re dealing with. Keep your distance. Don’t engage. I need to go down to the prison.” I turn to Avitas. “I suppose you’ll insist on coming with me?”
“I know the Warden better than you,” he says. “It is unwise to go barging into the prison. There are far too many of the Commandant’s spies inside. If she knows you’re here, she’ll try to sabotage you.”
I lift my eyebrows. “You mean she doesn’t know I’m here? I assumed you’d told her.”
Avitas says nothing, and as his silence grows longer, Faris shifts uncomfortably beside me. I see the faintest of cracks in Harper’s cold façade.
“I’m not her spy anymore,” he finally says. “If I were, you’d be dead by now. Because you’re too close to capturing Elias, and her orders were to kill you quietly when you got this close—to make it look like an accident.”
Faris draws his scim. “You filthy, traitorous—”
I hold up a hand to stop him and nod for Avitas to continue.
He pulls a thin paper envelope from his fatigues. “Nightweed,” he says. “Outlawed in the Empire. Skies only know where Keris got it. A little bit kills you slowly. A little more and your heart expires. The Commandant planned to say that the pressure of the mission was too much for you.”
“You think I’m so easy to kill.”
“No, actually.” The torchlight throws Avitas’s masked face into shadow, and for a second, he reminds me of someone I cannot place. “I’ve spent weeks figuring out how I’d do it without anyone the wiser.”
“And?”
“I decided I wouldn’t do it. As soon as that happened, I began misinforming her about what we were doing and where we were going.”
“Why change your mind? You must have known what the mission would entail.”
“I asked for the mission.” He puts the Nightweed away. “I told her she needed someone in close proximity to you if she wanted to take you down quietly.”
Faris doesn’t sheathe his scim. He’s edged forward, his huge body seeming to take up half the cave. “Why in the bleeding hells would you ask for this mission? You’ve got something against Elias?”
Avitas shakes his head. “I had … a question that needed an answer. Coming with you was the best way to get it.”
I open my mouth to ask him what question, but he shakes his head.
“The question doesn’t matter.”
“Of course it bleeding matters,” I snap. “What could possibly have made you change your alliance? And how am I to know that you won’t change it back?”
“I may have been her spy, Blood Shrike.” He meets my eyes, and the crack in his façade grows wider. “But I have never been her ally. I needed her. I needed answers. That is all I will tell you. If you cannot abide that, then send me away—or punish me. Whichever suits you. Just—” He pauses. Is that anxiety in his face? “Don’t go into Kauf to speak to the Warden. Send him a message. Get him out of his domain, where he’s strongest. Then do what you wish.”
I knew I couldn’t trust Harper. I never have trusted him. Yet he’s come clean now—here, where he has no allies and I have one at my back.
Still, I pinion him with my gaze. He doesn’t breathe.
“Double cross me,” I say, “and I’ll rip your heart out with my bare hands.”
Avitas nods. “I’d expect no less, Blood Shrike.”
“Right,” I say. “Regarding the Warden, I’m not a Yearling still wetting the bed, Harper. I know what that monster trades in: secrets and pain disguised as science and reason.”
But he loves his foul little kingdom. He won’t want it taken away. I can use that against him.
“Get the old man a message,” I say. “Tell him I wish to meet in the boathouse tonight. He’s to come alone.”
Harper leaves immediately, and when we’re sure he’s gone, Faris turns to me.
“Please don’t tell me you believe he’s suddenly on our side.”
“I don’t have time to puzzle it out.” I grab Elias’s things and shove them back in the crack in the wall. “If the Warden knows anything about Veturius, he won’t share that knowledge for free. He’ll want information in return. I have to figure out what I’m going to give him.”
«««
At midnight, Avitas and I slip into Kauf’s boathouse. The broad cross-beams of the roof gleam dully in the blue torchlight. The only sound is the occasional slap of the river against the sides of the boats.
Though Avitas asked the Warden to come alone, I still expect him to bring guards. As I peer into the shadows, I loosen my scim and roll my shoulders. The wooden hulls of canoes clank against each other, and outside, the prisoner transports anchored to the boathouse cast long shadows across the windows. A stiff wind rattles the glass.
“You’re sure he’s coming?”
The Northman nods. “He’s very interested in meeting you, Shrike. But—”
“Now, now, Lieutenant Harper, no need to coach our Shrike. She’s not a child.”
The Warden, as spindly and pale as an overgrown catacomb spider, slinks out of the darkness on the far side of the boathouse. How long was he skulking there? I force myself not to reach for my scim.
“I have questions, Warden.” You’re a worm. A twisted, pathetic parasite. I want him to hear the indifference in my voice. I want him to know that he is beneath me.
He stops a few feet away from me, his hands clasped behind his back. “How may I serve?”
“Have any of your prisoners escaped in the past few weeks? Have you had any break-ins or thefts?”
“No on all counts, Shrike.” Though I watch him carefully, I see no indication that he is lying.
“What about strange activity? Any guards seen where they shouldn’t be? Unexpected prisoners coming in?”
“The frigates bring new prisoners all the time.” The Warden taps his long fingers together thoughtfully. “I processed one myself quite recently. None, however, have been unexpected.”
My skin tingles. The Warden is telling the truth. But he’s hiding something at the same time. I feel it. Beside me, Avitas shifts his weight, as if he too senses something off.
“Blood Shrike,” the Warden says. “Forgive me, but why are you here, in Kauf, looking for such information? I thought you had rather an urgent mission to find Elias Veturius?”
I draw myself up. “Do you always ask questions of your superior officers?”
“Do not take offense. I am merely wondering if something might have brought Veturius here.”
I notice how he watches my face for a reaction, and I steel myself for whatever he’s going to say next.
“Because if you were willing to tell me why you suspect he is here, then perhaps I might be able to share something … useful.”
Avitas glances at me. A warning. The game begins.
“For instance,” the Warden says, “the girl he’s traveling with—who is she?”
“Her brother is in your prison.” I offer the information freely—a show of good faith. You help me, I’ll help you. “I believe Veturius is attempting to free him.”
The light in the Warden’s eyes means I’ve given him something he wants. For a second, guilt floods me. If the boy is in the prison, I’ve made it far more difficult for Elias to get him out.
“What is she to him, Blood Shrike? What hold does she have over him?”
I take a step toward the old man so he can see the truth in my eyes. “I don’t know.”
Outside the boathouse, the wind picks up. It sighs in the eaves, eerie as a death rattle. The Warden tilts his head, his lashless eyes unblinking.
“Say her name, Helene Aquilla, and I’ll tell you something worth your while.”
I exchange a glance with Avitas. He shakes his head. I grip my scim to find that my palms are slick on the hilt. As a Fiver, I spoke to the Warden no more than twice. But I knew—all of the Fivers knew—that he was watching. What did he learn about me in that time? I was a child, only twelve. What could he have learned about me?
“Laia.” I allow no inflection in my voice. But the Warden cocks his head in cold assessment.
“Jealousy and anger,” he says. “And … ownership? A connection. Something deeply irrational, I believe. Strange …”
A connection. The healing—the protectiveness I don’t wish to feel. Bleeding skies. He got all of that from one word? I school my face, refusing to let him know what I feel. Still, he smiles.
“Ah,” he says softly. “I see that I’m correct. Thank you, Blood Shrike. You have given me much. But now I must depart. I don’t like to be away from the prison for too long.”
As if Kauf is a new bride he pines for. “You promised me information, old man,” I say.
“I’ve already told you what you need to know, Blood Shrike. Perhaps you weren’t listening. I thought you would be”—the Warden looks vaguely disappointed—“smarter.”
The Warden’s bootsteps echo in the empty boathouse as he walks away. When I reach for my scim, fully intending to make him talk, Avitas grabs my arm.
“No, Shrike,” he whispers. “He never says anything without reason. Think—he must have given us a hint.”
I don’t need bleeding hints! I throw off Avitas’s hand, unsheathe my blade, and stride toward the Warden. And as I do, it hits me—the one thing he said that raised the hairs on my neck. I processed one myself quite recently. Not unexpected, however.
“Veturius,” I say. “You have him.”
The Warden stops. I cannot quite see the old man’s face as he half turns toward me, but I hear the smile in his voice. “Excellent, Shrike. Not so disappointing after all.”
