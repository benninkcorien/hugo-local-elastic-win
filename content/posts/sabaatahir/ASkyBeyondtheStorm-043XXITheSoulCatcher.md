XXI: The Soul Catcher, A Sky Beyond the Storm
XXI: The Soul Catcher
Leaving the Waiting Place used to anger Mauth. But once he joined with me, he loosened the leash. Which is useful now, for Tribe Nasur trades in Aish, well south of the Waiting Place’s border. Their Fakira, Aubarit, is one I trust completely. She may know something about the rot plaguing the forest.
As I windwalk, a howling gale sweeps through the long stretches of parched land, peppered with dirt devils and the occasional dust storm. The last time I dealt with weather this unnatural, the Nightbringer was behind it. I have no doubt that he and his ilk are behind this too. Only a day after I set out, I must take shelter.
It’s been years since I traveled with a caravan, so I force myself to sift through my recollections of the Blood Shrike. We had plenty of hidey-holes out here when we were Fivers. One memory stands out: she dared me to burgle a massive pot of rice pudding bubbling in the middle of a Tribal camp. It was a stupid dare, but we were hungry and it smelled good. We escaped the Tribesmen who came after us only through sheer luck; we stumbled on a nearby cave and hid for three days.
As I make for that same cave now, I think about how, to this day, I’ve never tasted anything as good as that rice pudding. It’s sweeter because you almost died stealing it, Helene said, grinning as we stuffed our faces. Makes you appreciate every bite.
The cave was near a massive escarpment several hours north of Aish, and I’m relieved to find that not only is it still there, but that the stream nearby runs high. I don’t like being stuck—I don’t like anything that will keep me from carrying out my duty. But at least I won’t suffer from thirst.
I start a small fire just outside the cave and take in my reflection in the stream—my face, hair, and clothes are all a pale, sand-blasted beige.
“You might well be one of us, Banu al-Mauth,” a deep voice says. “Though we would not be fool enough to ride winds such as these.”
A diaphanous figure steps into the firelight. At first, I am confused, for despite its shape, it cannot possibly be human.
“Rowan Goldgale,” the figure says. “We have met before.”
I recognize the name. “Yes,” I say. “You tried to murder my friend and me during the Trials. Now you and your fellow sand efrits are burning Tribal wagons and ransacking villages.”
“All are actions we have been forced to take.” Rowan steps closer, and I look behind him, wondering if he’s brought his marauding fellows with him. But he shakes his sandy head.
“I come alone, Banu al-Mauth, in humility and sincerity, in the hopes that you might hear my plea.”
I bid him sit and he crosses his legs on the floor of the cave, his form growing solid enough that I can make out a beak-like nose and thin lips.
“The Nightbringer moves against the human world.” As Rowan speaks, he gestures. The sand on my face, hair, and clothes drifts into a cloud, dropping into a neat pile, leaving me looking marginally more human. “He has enslaved my kind and sworn us to silence, but his plans—”
The king of the sand efrits shudders and I lean forward. Efrits have always struck me as having a sort of malicious mischievousness. But Rowan couldn’t be more serious.
Human world. I think of Laia, of the Blood Shrike, and my curiosity gets the better of me.
“What are his plans? He’s already killing at will.”
“My vows prevent me from sharing his plans, but—”
“That’s convenient,” I say. “Then why mention them?”
“Because my people read the desert winds as the Augurs read their dreams. They see a great commander who—”
“Do they see anything about the Waiting Place?” I ask. Rowan appears taken aback. I suppose kings rarely get interrupted.
“There is rot in the forest and I need to know why. Do your wind prophecies mention it?”
“Nay, Banu al-Mauth. But—”
“If you have nothing to tell me about the Nightbringer’s plans or the Waiting Place,” I say, “then I’m uninterested in what you saw.” I stand, and the efrit, startled, rises as well.
“Please, Banu al-Mauth. You are destined for more than this—”
“Don’t make me sing, Rowan.” I think of a tune someone crooned to me long ago. Efrit, efrit of the sand, a song is more than he can stand. “I have a rubbish voice. Like a cat getting strangled.”
“You will wish—”
“Lady Cassia Slaughter was a wrinkled old hag,” I sing, “but it’s said that her daughter was a mighty fine sha—”
The foul little sea shanty is the first song that comes to me, and before I finish the verse, Rowan howls and disappears, leaving only a cloud of dust in his wake.
When the cave is silent again, I turn to my dinner. The efrit was likely a ruse sent by the Nightbringer to distract me from my mission. The creatures cannot be trusted. It was efrits, after all, who tried to kill the Shrike and me during the Trials. Efrits who burned down Shaeva’s cabin.
Still I feel uneasy. What if Rowan wasn’t a ruse? What if I should have heard him out?
For a long time, I do not sleep. I sit by the fire, carving shapes into Laia’s armlet. When I lay my head down, Mauth’s magic finally stirs and smooths the unease away. By the time I wake, the efrit and his warning are forgotten.
«««
I reach Aish the next night, well after sunset. I haven’t been here in years—not long ago it was nothing but a seasonal trading post built around an oasis. But since I came here as a Blackcliff Fiver, Aish has burgeoned into a permanent settlement.
Like most Tribal cities, its population is fluid. But the Commandant’s assault on Sadh has swelled the city with refugees. The whitewashed buildings, built three and four stories high, are lined with archers. The many gates are flung open, each more crowded than the last with some people seeking shelter and others fleeing.
North of the walls, the Nasur encampment is in disarray. A steady stream of wounded trickles in—mostly women and children—all speaking of the fall of the city of Sadh.
“The Martials take no slaves, nor prisoners,” a white-haired woman tells the Nasur Kehanni. “They just kill.”
Briefly, I wonder if Laia ever arrived here. She was headed for Aish. You’re here for Aubarit, Soul Catcher. Not Laia.
Tribe Nasur is not the only one taking refuge north of the city gates. I recognize the green and gold wagons of Tribe Nur, and the green and silver of Tribe Saif. As I survey the vast encampment, searching for the Fakira’s wagon, a familiar, dark-haired figure hurries past.
She holds two injured children, and at the sight of her, I nearly call out. I should know her from my own memories, but instead it is the memories Cain gave me of Laia and Helene and Keris that tell me who she is.
Mamie Rila. My adoptive mother.
She hands the children over to a Tribal healer and hurries back the way she came. Then, quite suddenly, she stops short. Tentatively, she searches the darkness.
“E-Elias?”
“Banu al-Mauth now, Mamie Rila.” I emerge into the light.
She stiffens and bows her head. “Of course.” Her voice is low, but it cannot hide her bitterness. “Why are you here, Banu al-Mauth?”
“I must speak with Aubarit Ara-Nasur.”
She considers for a moment, then nods. “If any here see you . . .” She sighs. “They will think you are here to help. Come.”
Mamie avoids the chaotic center of the camp and heads to the outer circle of wagons. The warriors of Tribe Nasur stand guard in the empty spaces, glaring out at the dark, waiting perhaps for the shine of a Martial blade, or worse, the swift-moving flames that herald approaching jinn.
“There.” Mamie nods past the guards, to a wagon nestled in the shadows of Aish’s wall.
“Thank you.” I leave her, slipping past Tribe Nasur guards and toward Aubarit’s wagon. Multicolored lamps twinkle brightly within, and when I rap on the door, it opens almost immediately.
“Banu al-Mauth!”
Aubarit holds a shroud in her hands, upon which she has sewn the geometric patterns of her tribe, traditional for a burial. She drops into a curtsy, flustered at my sudden arrival, and moves aside to let me in. “Forgive me, I did not know—”
“Sit, Fakira.” I take salt from the bowl beside her door and put it to my lips. “Be at ease.”
She sits at the edge of her bench, fingers twisted deeply within the shroud, the exact opposite of “at ease.”
“Would you like some—” She gestures to the hot tea on a table beside her bench, pulling another cup from the cupboard above, but I shake my head.
“Aubarit, I need to know if you—”
“Before you begin, Banu al-Mauth,” the girl says, “you must forgive us. There have been so many dead—but there are not enough Fakirs. You must be inundated, but the war—”
“How many dead since yesterday?”
“We’ve buried two dozen,” she whispers. “I was only able to do rites for half. The rest—their souls were already gone. I—I did not want to send you so many—”
The import of her words turns my blood to ice.
“The Waiting Place doesn’t have too many ghosts, Fakira,” I say. “It has too few. I passed only a dozen ghosts in the last week. I thought you and the other Fakirs had passed on those killed in Keris Veturia’s assault. But if you only did the rites for half, and if the other Fakirs are similarly inundated, then there should be hundreds of ghosts pouring into the Waiting Place.”
The Fakira nearly drops the shroud, her fear palpable. “The wall—”
“It holds. The ghosts are not escaping into the human world. If what you say is true, they are not arriving at all. Those who do enter don’t wish to move on. Not because of the suffering they endured in life, but because they fear what lies on the other side.”
A brief terror shines in Aubarit’s eyes, but I don’t have time for her fear. “They speak of a great maelstrom,” I say. “A hunger that wishes to devour them. What do the Mysteries say of this maelstrom? This hunger?”
Aubarit’s dark skin pales, her sprinkling of freckles standing out starkly. “I have heard of no maelstrom in the Mysteries. There is the Sumandar a Dhuka, the Sea of Suffering—”
“What is that?”
“I—I—”
At Blackcliff, our Centurions would slap us when we were too gripped by fear to carry out an order. Now I understand why.
“Speak, Fakira!”
“And though the Sea of Suffering churns, ever restless, verily does Mauth preside, a bulwark against its hunger.”
Laia’s voice whispers in my mind. I saw something, Soul Catcher. An ocean filled with—skies, I do not know.
“What else do you know about this sea?”
“It is the repository of human suffering,” Aubarit says. “All the sorrow and pain you take from the spirits and give to Mauth—it goes into the Sea. As you stand guardian between the ghosts and the world of the living, Mauth is the sentinel between the Sea of Suffering and our world.”
Aubarit puts down her tea, more agitated with every word. “But the Mysteries are vast, Banu al-Mauth. We have no magic to aid us in their learning, only words passed down through the centuries. We do not even know their source. Your answer might be in a part of the Mysteries called the Signs—but I never learned them. My grandfather died before he could teach me.”
Him and a dozen other Fakirs. The Nightbringer’s handiwork.
“Are there any Fakirs who know the Signs in their entirety, Aubarit?”
“Fakir An-Zia,” she says. “I do not know if he escaped Sadh.”
“There must be some way—” I stop at the sound of a hurried knock at the wagon door.
“Fakira.” I recognize Mamie’s voice from outside. “Banu al-Mauth, come quickly.”
I pull open the door. “Return later,” I bark, but she blocks the door before I can shut it.
“Fire on the horizon,” she says. “We must flee, or else take shelter in Aish.”
Aubarit clutches the shroud close. “Fire—”
“Jinn, Fakira.” Mamie grabs the girl’s arm and pulls her from the wagon. “The jinn are coming.”
