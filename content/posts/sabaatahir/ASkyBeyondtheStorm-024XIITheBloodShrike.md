XII: The Blood Shrike, A Sky Beyond the Storm
XII: The Blood Shrike
The Soul Catcher guides us away from the edge of the forest to a muddy game trail. I glance at him, searching for vestiges of my friend Elias Veturius. But other than the hard lines of his body and the sharp planes of his face, there isn’t a shred of the boy I knew.
We stop in a small clearing, and he watches as Laia carefully removes the arrow and bandages my wound. At the crack of a branch behind me, I draw my scim.
“Just a squirrel,” the Soul Catcher says. “The soldiers won’t enter here. The ghosts would drive them mad.”
My neck prickles. I know there are ghosts here, but they are quiet, far different from the screeching demons that possessed my men at the gates of Antium.
“Why won’t they drive us mad?” It is the first Tas has spoken.
The Soul Catcher looks down at the boy, and his voice is gentler. “I don’t know,” he says. His brow is furrowed. It’s the look he’d get at Blackcliff when the Commandant would send us after a deserter, and he couldn’t settle on how he felt about it.
Forget about Blackcliff, Shrike. I have more important things to think about. Like getting the hells back to my nephew. Figuring out what my next steps are beyond crossing this wood for three weeks.
By the time I reach Delphinium, I will have been gone for two months. Skies know what I will find on my return.
When I mutter as much to Laia, she shakes her head.
“Not if he helps us.” She glances at the Soul Catcher. He hears. He might be some otherworldly servant of ghosts now, but he’s still tied to Laia, still a part of her song, whether he admits it or not.
“You’ll be through by dawn,” he says. “But stay close. The ghosts are not the only fey who walk the Waiting Place. There are older creatures that would seek to harm you.”
“The jinn,” Laia says. “Those the Nightbringer freed.”
The Soul Catcher gives her a brief, unreadable look. “Yes. One human might slip through the forest undetected by them. But a half dozen? They will know you are here soon enough.”
“Can’t you just—” Musa puts his hands around his throat and mimes choking—referring no doubt to how the Soul Catcher can steal away breath.
“I’d rather not.” The Soul Catcher’s voice is so cold that Musa, who lives and breathes impudence, is silent. “I will windwalk you across,” the Soul Catcher goes on. “But there are many of you, and it will take time. We will be pursued.”
“But the jinn were just rampaging across the Mariner countryside,” Darin says. “How—”
“Not all of them,” Musa says. “The Nightbringer takes only a few on his raids. But thousands were imprisoned. And they used to live here. Do they still?” Musa glances around warily. “Do you let them?”
“This was their home before it was mine.” The Soul Catcher tilts his head, and it’s another gesture I recognize. His instincts shout a warning at him.
“We’ve tarried too long. Child—” He reaches out a hand to Tas, whose face falls at the Soul Catcher’s aloofness.
I understand his grief. When Elias turned his back on me in Antium, I didn’t realize what he had become. Not really. Even now, he looks the same as ever. He feels solid. Real.
But he’s put duty above all things. He’s put on the mask and set aside his humanity. Just like we were trained to do.
Tas takes the Soul Catcher’s hand and we form a chain, Tas holding on to Harper, then me, Musa, Darin, and Laia.
“Walk as you normally would,” the Soul Catcher says. “Close your eyes if you wish. But no matter what you see, do not let go of each other. Do not reach for a weapon. Do not try to fight.” He looks at me when he says this and I nod grudgingly. I know an order when I hear one.
Seconds later, we are flying, the trees blurring by faster than I thought possible. It feels as if I am on a boat tearing across a wild sea with the wind at my back. Naked branches whip past, a massive oak, a clearing of frosted grass, a lake, a family of foxes.
The smell of the ocean fades, and we are in the deep woods, the canopy so thick I cannot make out the evening sky. Beneath my feet, the underbrush is soft and springy. I don’t understand how the Soul Catcher can move us through such dense forest without knocking us all unconscious. But, as when he was a soldier fighting at my back, he does it with complete confidence. After an hour passes, I let myself relax.
Then Laia screams. Her hair has come loose from her braid, streaming out behind her. Beyond it, a half dozen shadows stir, each with eyes that blaze like tiny suns.
My stomach plunges, and I want my scim so badly that I nearly countermand the Soul Catcher’s order and pull away from Harper. Because for a second, I think one of the shadows is him. The Nightbringer. The monster who demanded my mask from me, who engineered the hell rained down upon my people.
But these shapes are different. The Nightbringer is a typhoon of wrath and subtlety. These creatures are a shadow of that. Still, their anger is palpable, like the air before a lightning storm.
“Soul Catcher!” I shout.
“I see them.” He sounds almost bored, but when he looks back over his shoulder, he has the flat concentration of a Mask surrounded by the enemy. He cuts north—then west again, then north, then west until my head spins and I don’t know what direction we’re going.
The sun dips below the horizon, and for a time, it seems as though we’ve outrun the jinn. The River Dusk is nothing more than a flash of blue and a rush of sound before it is past. But not long after we cross, they catch us. This time, we can’t shake them. The jinn shriek madly and surround us.
Ahhh, Blood Shrike. The voice is sibilant and feels as if it’s worming through my mind. Without your sacrifice we would never have been free. Accept a token of our gratitude, a glimpse into your future.
“No!” I shout. “I don’t want—”
We see you, baby bird, not a Shrike but a small and weak thing, fallen far from safety. Parents dead, sister gone, and the other sister soon to join her—
“Stop!” I curse them, but they do not stop. The minutes are hours, and the hours are days as the jinn dig around in my thoughts. I cannot keep them out.
You do not love the child, they say. He is your blood, but you’ll see him dead and yourself upon the throne. You have always wanted it, wicked, wicked Shrike. They pack my mind with images of violence: my nephew, sweet Zacharias, lying limp, his small face drained of life. The horror of it is worse for his innocence, for the burden of rulership that he never knew he carried.
As I cry and beg that he be brought back, Keris laughs. The scars on my face ache, a soul-deep pain. Cook speaks in my ear, poor dead Mirra, but I cannot hear what she says because now there is a great roaring, a maelstrom coming closer, and it will devour us all—
Then I hear the Soul Catcher, though he is not next to me. “Do not listen to them,” he says. “They want to break the chain. They want to fall upon each of you, tear you away and consume your minds. Do not let them. Fight.”
“I can’t,” I whisper. “I—”
“You can. It is who you are. It is what you do best.”
It is what I do best. Because I am strong, and I dig for that strength now. I watched my family bleed out at my feet and I fought for my people and faced a horde of Karkauns alone on a hill of dead bodies. I am a fighter. I am the Blood Shrike.
You are a child.
I am the Blood Shrike.
You are weak.
I am the Blood Shrike.
You are nothing.
“I am the Blood Shrike!” I scream, and the words echo back to me, not in my own voice but in my father’s and my mother’s, in Hannah’s and in the voices of all those lost at Antium.
Broken, unmade thing, you will lose more before the end, for you are a torch against the night, little Shrike, and above all a torch burns.
Quite suddenly, we stumble to a stop in a clearing. A dimly lit cabin rises out of the darkness. I stumble toward it, along with Darin and Harper. Laia has an arm wrapped around Tas, her teeth bared.
The Soul Catcher stands between us and the heavily cloaked jinn, who pace beyond the clearing. He has no weapon. He needs none, for in this moment, he calls to mind his mother’s quiet violence.
“You will not touch these humans,” he says. “Leave.”
One of the jinn detaches from the others. “They are your weakness, Soul Catcher.” She drips with malice, shakes with it. “You will fall and the Waiting Place will fall with you.”
“Not today, Umber,” the Soul Catcher says. “They are under my protection. And you have no power here.”
The softer the Commandant spoke, the more dangerous she was. The Soul Catcher’s voice is very low indeed, and power pulses through him. The air in the clearing thickens. The fire in the jinns’ eyes pales, as if suddenly quenched.
The jinn retreat, fading into the trees, and when they are gone, my legs go weak, my wound aching. Harper is beside me instantly, shaky himself but trying to hold me up. Musa stands apart, eyes glazed. Darin is pale as he wraps an arm around Laia’s trembling shoulders.
Tas is unaffected, and glances between us. “What—what happened?”
“Are you okay, Tas?” Laia pulls him close. “It wasn’t real what they said. You know that—”
“They didn’t speak to the child.” The Soul Catcher casts an appraising look at us. “The border is close,” he says. “But they will be waiting, and they are strongest at night. You are depleted. As am I. Come. They cannot hurt us in the cabin.”
The cabin is large and smells of wood shavings, but it’s tight as a drum and solid as Blackcliff. A stove squats in one corner, with copper pans hanging from hooks on the wall. Beside it is a shelf with baskets of carrots and gourds and potatoes. Strings of garlic and onion hang from above, along with bunches of herbs I couldn’t begin to name.
There is also a table, fresh-built with a long bench on either side. A fireplace sits in the center of the room against the back wall, with a soft Tribal rug and cushions strewn about. The Soul Catcher’s bed is spare, but Tribal lanterns hang above it, making it seem almost cozy.
After a moment I realize what the cabin reminds me of: Mamie Rila’s wagon.
The Soul Catcher prepares a meal and though I know I should help, I do nothing, still numb from the jinns’ predations. Only Tas has the energy, setting out plates and cups until the Soul Catcher bids him sit.
I always preferred Elias’s cooking on long journeys. Distantly, I understand that the meal he serves us is hearty and well seasoned. But I do not taste it. From the silence at the table, no one else does either.
After, we take turns in the washroom, and though the water is ice-cold, I scrub off a week’s worth of sea brine gratefully. By the time I emerge, Musa, Darin, and Tas are fast asleep on the floor. Harper has lain down on his roll too, his eyes shut. But if he’s asleep, then I am a walrus. I wonder what the jinn said to him. I do not ask.
Instead I sit beside Laia, who is cross-legged before the fire. She runs a comb through her long hair, pointedly ignoring Elias as he cleans. His sleeves are rolled up, big hands carefully scrubbing out the stew pot with sand. His hair is longer, curling at the ends, but other than that, he looks like he’ll turn to me any moment with a smile on his face and a tale that will have me in stitches.
“The last time the three of us were in a room together, I was about to kill you,” I say to Laia. “Sorry about that.”
“I’ll forgive you—one day.” Laia smiles, but her eyes are sad. “Do you want to talk about it?”
I shake my head. After a moment, I realize she might have asked because she, too, is haunted by what the jinn said to her.
“Do—do you?”
She wraps her arms around her legs and makes herself small. “I was alone,” she whispers. “Everyone was gone. The Nightbringer had taken Darin. You. Tas. Afya Ara-Nur. Even E—the Soul Catcher. And there was this—this storm. But it was alive and—”
“Hungry,” I say. “A maw, wanting to devour the world. I felt that too.”
The Soul Catcher turns toward us. We lock eyes for a moment, until he shifts that cold gray gaze to Laia.
“You spoke of a hunger, Blood Shrike,” the Soul Catcher says. “What did it feel like? Look like?”
I consider. “It was a storm. Massive. And it felt—skies, I don’t know—”
“Why are you asking, Soul Catcher? Do you know of it?” Laia says, and at his silence, she leans forward. “You’ve seen it too. Where?”
But the Soul Catcher shakes his head. “In dreams,” he murmurs.
“You must know something,” I say. “Or why ask us the question?”
He joins us before the fire, putting a good distance between himself and Laia. “The Augur spoke of it,” he finally says.
“Augur?” I say. The Augurs haven’t been seen since the jinn were released. “Cain? What did he say? Is he here in the Waiting Place? Has he been here all this time?”
“He’s dead,” the Soul Catcher says. “The Augurs are all dead. The Nightbringer killed them when he set the jinn free—all but Cain. He died a few days ago. I . . . was there.”
“Dead?” I cannot fathom it. The Augurs are immortal. As much as I loathe them, their power is staggering.
But if they are dead, what does it mean for Zacharias? The Augurs named Marcus the Foretold—the Greatest Emperor, scourge of our enemies, commander of a host most devastating. They legitimized his dynasty. Their support was vital.
“Why would the Nightbringer kill them?” I ask.
“Because of what Cain—and the Augurs—did to the jinn.”
At mine and Laia’s twin looks of confusion, the Soul Catcher considers us. Then he tells of Cain’s invasion and betrayal of Shaeva. Of the Nightbringer’s desperation to protect his kind. That part of the story is so familiar that I clench my fists in sympathy. I know what it is to fail my people.
When the tale is over, my questions flee my mind. All I can think of is what Cain said to me before Antium fell.
The Nightbringer is no monster, child, though he may do monstrous things. He is cloven by sorrow and thus locked in a righteous battle to amend a grievous wrong.
“So the Augurs were Scholars.” Laia sounds as numb as I feel. “The first time I met Cain he told me—but I did not understand. He said he was guilty. That all of the Augurs were guilty.”
“He knew he was going to die,” I say. “The time to atone for our sins approaches, he said. I remember because I couldn’t stop thinking about it.”
“Jinn speak prophecy at death.” The Soul Catcher lifts his hands to the fire, and I find I’m surprised. I wouldn’t think he’d feel the cold.
“When the Augurs stole jinn powers, the theft backfired,” he says. “The Augurs were left in a state of living death. They could not sleep or rest or die. But they could see the future—far more clearly than the jinn ever could. In those visions, there was only one path to freedom.”
“Freedom for them,” Laia says. “What about the rest of us? He called you and me embers in the ashes, Soul Catcher. He said the Shrike was—”
“A torch against the night. If I dared to let myself burn.” Skies, I was naive. “Lies. For them, we were just a means to an end.”
“Perhaps,” the Soul Catcher says. “In any case, the Augur had a message for you. For both of you.”
Laia’s dark brows shoot up. “When were you planning on telling us?”
“I’m telling you now.” The Soul Catcher’s composure is grating and Laia’s nostrils flare.
“Before he died, Cain, too, spoke prophecy,” the Soul Catcher says. “It was never one. It was always three. The Blood Shrike is the first. Laia of Serra, the second. And the Soul Catcher is the last. The Mother watches over them all. If one fails, they all fail. If one dies, they all die. Go back to the beginning and there, find the truth. Strive even unto your own end, else all is lost.”
He speaks like a scribe reading off a page, like he isn’t delivering the last words of a creature that helped to cause untold destruction and death.
“That was all,” he says after a pause. “He died just after.”
“The first—the last—?” Laia shakes her head. “It makes no sense.”
“The Augurs are not known for their perspicuity,” the Soul Catcher says. “Before . . .” He shrugs. “I could never make sense of them.”
“Curse them,” Laia spits. “The jinn are murdering innocent people. The Nightbringer has a fleet headed for Sadh under Keris’s flag. The Tribal lands will fall unless they are stopped. We do not have time for Augur riddles. Though—” She considers. “He did get one thing right. I will strive to the end. I will not give up. Not until the Nightbringer is dead.”
“The troubles of the human world are not my concern,” the Soul Catcher says, and the finality of his words is chilling. “The Augur asked that I relay the message. He was dying, and I didn’t wish to deny his last request.”
He rises and makes for his bunk, carelessly stripping off his shirt as he goes. I’m silenced at the sight of him, at that stretch of golden skin, the planes of hard muscle, the ridges and runnels of scars across his wide shoulders, a mirror of my own.
If he was still Elias, I’d have thrown a pillow at his head for being so obvious about showing off his attributes. Now the sight just makes me sad.
Beside me, Laia plucks at the knots on her bedroll, then dashes her hand against her eyes. What can I say to her? It is torment to love someone hopelessly, with no chance of requital. There is no salve for it, no cure, no comfort.
I undo the knots and lie down with my back to her, so she can mourn in peace.
The fire dims and I try to sleep, but the jinns’ words scream through my head. You’ll see him dead and yourself upon the throne. If Zacharias dies, it will be because I did not protect him. I could not live with myself if I did not keep my baby nephew safe.
Without Marinn’s backing, the task will be difficult. Keris wants Zacharias and Livia dead. Grímarr lurks in Antium, tormenting my people and choking off my supplies. The Delphinium Paters lose faith. Our weaponry and soldiers are limited. Our food is running out. And the Commandant—she has all of those things. Along with a horde of jinn at her back.
My gaze falls on Harper. Other than Laia, everyone is asleep. No one would see if I let myself look at him. If I considered his beauty and his strength. But I make myself look away.
You are all that holds back the darkness. I draw on my father’s words, spoken just before he died. Those are the words I will live by. The words I will chant to myself.
I will find allies. I will protect my family. I will buy, borrow, or steal weaponry. I will recruit soldiers.
I will see my nephew on the throne. Even unto my own end.
