A Torch Against the Night
CHAPTER FORTY
Laia
Keenan and I crouch behind a fallen log and survey the cave. It doesn’t look like much.
“A half mile from the river, surrounded by hemlock trees, east-facing, with a creek to the north and a granite slab turned on its side a hundred yards south.” Keenan nods to each landmark. “It can’t be anyplace else.”
The rebel pulls his hood lower. A small mountain of snow grows on each of his shoulders. The wind whistles around us, flinging bits of ice into our eyes. Despite the fleece-lined boots Keenan stole for me from Delphinium, I cannot feel my feet. But at least the storm covered our approach and muted the prison’s haunting moans.
“We haven’t seen any movement.” I pull my cloak tight. “And this storm is getting worse. We’re wasting time.”
“I know you think I’m mad,” Keenan says. “But I don’t want us to walk into a trap.”
“There’s no one here,” I say. “We’ve seen no tracks, no signs of anyone in these woods other than us. And what if Darin and Elias are in there and they’re hurt or starving?”
Keenan watches the cave for a second more, then stands. “All right. Let’s go.”
When we get close, my body will no longer allow me any caution. I draw my dagger, stride past Keenan, and step warily inside.
“Darin?” I whisper to the darkness. “Elias?” The cave feels abandoned. But then, Elias would make sure it didn’t look like the place was occupied.
A light flares from behind me—Keenan holds up a lamp, illuminating the cobwebbed walls, the leaf-strewn floor. The cave is not large, but I wish it were. Then the sight of its emptiness would not be so crushingly definitive.
“Keenan,” I whisper. “It doesn’t look like anyone’s been here in years. Elias might not have even reached here.”
“Look.” Keenan reaches into a deep crack at the back of the cave and pulls out a pack. I grab the lamp from him, my hope flaring. Keenan drops the pack, reaches in deeper, and digs out a familiar set of scims.
“Elias,” I breathe. “He was here.”
Keenan opens the pack, pulling out what looks like week-old bread and moldering fruit. “He hasn’t been back recently, or he’d have eaten this. And”—Keenan takes the lamp from me and illuminates the rest of the cave—“there’s no sign of your brother. Rathana is in a week. Elias should have gotten Darin out by now.”
The wind wails like an angry spirit desperate for release. “We can shelter here for now.” Keenan drops his own pack. “The storm is too bad for us to find another camp anyway.”
“But we have to do something,” I say. “We don’t know if Elias went in, if he got Darin out, if Darin is alive—”
Keenan takes my shoulders. “We made it here, Laia. We made it to Kauf. As soon as the storm blows over, we’ll find out what happened. We’ll find Elias and—”
“No,” a voice speaks from the entrance to the cave. “You won’t. Because he’s not here.”
My heart plunges, and I clutch the hilt of my dagger. But when I see the three masked figures standing at the entrance of the cave, I know it will do me little good.
One of the figures steps forward, a half head taller than me, her mask a quicksilver glimmer beneath her furred hood.
“Laia of Serra,” Helene Aquilla says. If the storm outside had a voice, it would be hers, gelid, deathly, and utterly unfeeling.
