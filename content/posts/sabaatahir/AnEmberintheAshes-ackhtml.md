ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My fervent thanks, first and always, to my parents: My mother, my north star, my safe place, for being the exact opposite of the Commandant; and my father, who taught me the meaning of perseverance and faith, and who never once doubted me.
My husband Kashi is my greatest defender and the most fearless man I know. Thank you for convincing me to climb this mountain and for carrying me when I fell. To my boys, my inspirations: Here’s hoping you grow up to have Elias’s courage, Laia’s determination, and Helene’s capacity to love.
Haroon, trailblazer and purveyor of fine music, thank you for having my back like no one else, and for reminding me what it means to be family. Amer, personal Gandalf and perfect human, thank you for a thousand things, but most of all for teaching me to believe in myself.
My deepest appreciation to: Alexandra Machinist—ninja-agent, slayer of doubt and answerer of 32,101 questions—I’m in awe of you. Thank you for your unshakeable belief in this book; Cathy Yardley, whose guidance has changed my life—I’m honored to have you as a mentor and a friend; Stephanie Koven, my tireless international champion—thank you for helping me share my book with the world; and Kathleen Miller, whose friendship is a most precious gift.
I couldn’t imagine a better publishing home than Penguin. My thanks to Don Weisberg, Ben Schrank, Gillian Levinson (who loves me, even when I send her 14 emails in one day), Casey McIntyre, Erin Berger, Emily Osborne, Johnathan Roberts, Emily Romero, Shanta Newlin, Felicia Frazier and the remarkable people in sales, marketing and publicity who championed this book.
For their steadfast faith in me, I owe a debt of gratitude to the rest of my family: Uncle and Auntie Tahir, Heelah, Imaan and Armaan Saleem, Tala Abbasi and Lilly, Zoey and Bobby.
My heartfelt thanks to Saul Jaeger, Stacey LaFreniere, Connor Nunley and Jason Roldan for their service to their country and for showing me what it means to have the soul of a warrior.
For their encouragement and general awesomeness, great thanks to: An-drea Walker, Sarah Balkin, Elizabeth Ward, Mark Johnson, Holly Goldberg Sloan, Tom Williams, Sally Wilcox, Kathy Wenner, Jeff Miller, Shannon Casey, the Fearless 15ers and the Writer Unboxed Community.
Sincere thanks to Angels and Airwaves for “The Adventure”, “Sea Wolf for Wicked Blood” and M83 for “Outro.” Without those songs, this book wouldn’t exist.
Last, (but only because I know He doesn’t mind), I thank the one who has been with me from the beginning. I look for your 7s everywhere. Without you, I am nothing.
