XVII: Laia, A Sky Beyond the Storm
XVII: Laia
Winter falls harsh on the Forest of Dusk. The thick evergreens protect me from the worst of the wind. They do not, however, protect me from Elias’s frosty countenance.
The first day after he finds me, I try walking beside him—talking to him. He bolts so far ahead I can barely see him. For the rest of the day, I walk alone, missing Darin, Musa, Tas—even the Blood Shrike. At one point, I call out to Rehmat, thinking I can finally ask it questions about its origin. But it does not respond.
Later that night, when I pull out a meal of desiccated dates and flatbread, Elias disappears, returning a quarter hour later with a steaming bun stuffed with minced fowl, raisins, and almonds.
“Did you steal this?”
At his shrug, I bristle. “This is someone’s hard-earned labor, Elias.”
“Soul Catcher, please.”
I ignore that. “I will not eat it if you stole it.”
“You wouldn’t, would you?” His glance is fleeting and I cannot tell if he is mocking me or making an observation. “I always leave a gold mark,” he says flatly. “Bakers are less likely to lock their doors that way.”
I am about to respond when I notice the stiffness of his shoulders. How he clenches his fists.
When Elias and I traveled through the Serran Range after escaping Raider’s Roost, I did not wish to talk, for I had taken my first life—a Tribesman who tried to kill us both.
Elias was so careful with me then. He spoke to me—but he did not rush me. He gave me time. Perhaps, with his mind so deeply entwined with Mauth, I must do the same.
The next day, I do not speak and he relaxes a touch. In the evening, when we’ve stopped, I break my silence.
“I saw your mother, you know,” I tell him. “She’s as charming as ever.”
He pokes at the fire with a stick.
“She tried to kill me,” I go on. “But then her master and my former lover showed up. The Nightbringer—you remember him. He was in full Keenan regalia. Red hair, brown eyes, those freckles . . .”
I sneak a look at Elias. But other than a slight tightening of his infuriatingly square jaw, he does not react.
“Do you ever think of Keris as your mother?” I ask him. “Or will she always be the Commandant? Some days, I cannot believe Cook and my mother were the same person. I miss her. Father and Lis too.”
I yearn to speak of my family, I realize. To share my sadness with someone.
“I dream of them,” I say. “Always the same nightmare. Mother singing that song and the sound of their necks br-breaking—”
He says nothing, only rises and melts into the night. The space he leaves is vast, that gnawing loneliness of showing your heart to someone only to find they never wanted to see it. The next day, he is silent. And the next. Until three days have passed. Then ten.
I talk about everything under the sun—even Rehmat—and still he says nothing. Skies, but I have never known a man so stubborn.
After a fortnight, we make camp early, and Elias disappears. Usually when he leaves, he windwalks and I cannot follow. But this time, he stalks into the forest and I find him in a clearing, lifting a small boulder above his head—then slamming it down. Lifting it, slamming it down.
“Easy,” I say. “What did that poor rock do to you?”
He does not appear surprised by my presence, even though he was engrossed in his strange ritual.
“It helps when—” He gestures to his head and lifts the rock again. This time, when he drops it, I sit on it.
“You need a pet, Elias,” I say, “if you are turning to rocks for company.”
“I don’t need a pet.” He leans down, grabs me by the waist, and throws me over his shoulder.
I yelp. “Elias Veturius, you—you put me down—”
He drops me at the edge of the clearing—not ungently—and goes back to his boulder.
“You do need a pet.” I settle my breath, which has gone a bit shallow, and circle him, considering. “Not a cat. Too solitary. Maybe a horse, though with your windwalking you would not have much use for one. An Ankanese jumping spider, perhaps? Or a ferret?”
“Ferret?” He looks almost offended. “A dog. A dog would be fine.”
“A small one.” I nod. “One that barks incessantly so that you have to pay attention to it.”
“No, no, a big one,” he says, “Strong. Loyal. A Tiborum shepherd dog, maybe, or a—”
He stops short, realizing that he is engaging in actual conversation. I smile at him. But he makes me pay for my victory, stepping into a windwalk and vanishing, muttering about seeing to the ghosts.
“Why?” I mutter to the trees hours later, unable to sleep. “Why did I have to fall in love first with a vengeance-obsessed fire creature, and then with a noble idiot who, who—”
Who gave up his freedom and future so Darin and I could live. Who chained himself to an eternity alone because of a vow he made.
“What do I do?” I mutter. “Darin—what would you do?”
“Why do you ask the night, child? The night will not answer.”
Rehmat’s voice is a whisper, its form a scant shadow limned in gold.
“I thought I’d imagined you.” I offer it a smile, for imperious as the creature is, its presence leavens my loneliness. “Where have you been?”
“Unimportant. You wish to speak to your brother. Yet you do not. Why?”
“He is hundreds of miles away.”
“You are kedim jadu. He is kedim jadu. And he is your blood. If you wish to speak to him, speak to him. Still your mind. Reach.”
“How—” I stop myself from asking and consider. Rehmat was right about my disappearing. Perhaps it is right about this too.
I close my eyes and imagine a deep, quiet lake. Pop did this with patients sometimes, children whose bellies ached for reasons we could not see, or men and women unable to sleep for days. Breathe in. Let the air nourish you. Breathe out. Expel your fears.
I sink into the stillness. Then I call out, imagining my voice stretching across the miles.
“Darin. Are you there?”
At first, there is only silence. I begin to feel foolish. Then—
Laia?
“Yes!” I nearly leap up in my excitement. “Yes, it’s me.”
Laia, what is this? Are you all right?
“I’m fine,” I say. “I—I am in the Waiting Place.”
Is Elias with you? Is he still being an idiot?
“He is not an idiot!”
Figured you’d say that. I wanted to make sure it was really you. Are you sure you’re all right? You sound—
Rehmat appears so suddenly that its glow blinds me. “Fey creatures! Approaching from the west. They must have heard you, Laia. Forgive me—I did not sense them. Arm yourself!”
The gold light fades as quickly as it appeared, and I am left alone in the inky murk. I scramble to my feet, dagger at the ready, my pulse pounding. A cricket chirps nearby and the wind whispers through the branches. The forest is quiet.
And then, in an instant, it is silent. Shapes flit between the trees, too fast to track. Jinn? Efrits?
I scuttle back, trying to use the night to my advantage. The darkness can feel like an enemy, the Blood Shrike said once, insisting I wear a blindfold while she trained me in hand-to-hand combat. Let it be a friend instead.
The shadows draw closer. Where in the skies is Elias? Of course, when he and his big fists and murderous demeanor might actually come in handy, he’s not here.
Something cold brushes past me, and I feel as if my neck has been plunged into pure snow. I dart around the fire—kicking at it to get air on the embers. They flare for a moment, then fade. But not before I see what hides in the dark.
Wraiths.
Stay calm. Elias and I fought these things out in the desert east of Serra. Taking off their heads kills them. Too bad I have a dagger with no reach instead of a scim.
Invisibility will not fool them. All I can do is run. I kick the embers into the faces of the wraiths, and as they screech, I bolt through an opening in the trees. I feel them behind me, all around me, and lash out with my dagger. They fall back—and I have a few more inches, a few more seconds.
Did the Nightbringer send them? You fool, Laia. Did you think he would just let you get away?
Through the gasps of my breathing and the crunch of brush beneath my boots, I hear a creek. Most fey creatures hate water. I tear toward the sound, slipping on the wet rocks, only stopping when I am midstream, with the water at my knees.
“Come out, little girl.” The wraiths speak as one, their words high and reedy, as if a winter gale out of the Nevennes has been given voice. “Come out and meet your doom.”
“Why don’t you come in here?” I snarl. “You ragged bastards could use a bath.”
The blue starlight throws the shadows emerging from the woods into sharp relief. A dozen wraiths, at first. Then two dozen. Then more than fifty, their shredded clothing fluttering in a nonexistent wind.
They could have rushed me in the woods. Ambushed me. But they did not. Which means they want me alive.
Think! There is a reason the wraiths are here and it is not to kill me. Brazen it out, then, Laia. And hope to the skies you aren’t wrong. Without warning, I sprint through the water toward them.
I expect them to move. Instead they catch me and squeeze. Bad idea, Laia. Very bad idea.
Impossible cold lances through me and I scream. The chill is all-consuming, and I am certain that this will be a slow death, like being bricked away and knowing you will never escape.
My body seizes, my vision flashes to a vast sea, dark and teeming. Then to the River Dusk. I see it from above, the way a bird would. I follow its serpentine path through the Waiting Place. But there is something wrong. The river disappears, rotting at the edges. There are no ghosts winding among the trees. Instead, screams echo in the air and there are faces in the water. Thousands of them, trapped. The air grows ponderous, and I turn to face a maelstrom of teeth and sinew, obscenely violent. A maw that is never satisfied.
But it will not have me. No! Though the images I saw still reverberate in my skull, I have enough sense to lash out with my blade, dodging the shadows as they reach for me.
They want my screams, I realize. They want my pain.
“You cannot have it,” I roar at them. “You can have my wrath instead. My hate.”
“Laia—” Elias’s voice calls from somewhere on my right, and the wraiths chitter and draw back.
“She doesn’t belong here, Soul Catcher,” they say. “She is not dead.”
“Neither do you.” Elias’s words make me shudder, for they are delivered in the flat, cold voice of the Soul Catcher. Of a Mask. “Leave.”
He gathers his magic—I feel the air tighten around me. The wraiths recoil and I dart through them.
“Go, Elias!” I shout when I’m within reach of him. “Windwalk! Now!” His arms close around me and we are away.
I shiver from the cold still in my bones and press into him, desperate for his warmth. He moves so quickly that I close my eyes so I am not sick. The maelstrom circles in my head, ever devouring, and I have to tell myself that I am safe.
Safe. Safe. Safe. I chant the word to the throb of Elias’s heartbeat. The rhythmic thud is a reminder that despite his vow and his magic, his detachment and his distance, he is still human. By the time he slows, I have the sound memorized.
The scent of the Duskan Sea cuts through the air first, and then the dull roar of the waves. Seagulls call out, and far to the east, the sun burns away a heavy cloud bank.
We have traveled hundreds of miles. He got what he wanted after all—me out of his territory. As soon as we are free of the trees, he releases me. I crash to the earth, scraping my hand on a tree trunk trying to get my balance.
“The wraiths are far away.” Elias looks northwest, where a Martial guard tower looms atop a hill of dead grass. “But they might track you. Get to a human settlement quickly. When it’s full light, you’ll be safe to travel again.”
“I saw something, Soul Catcher,” I say. “An ocean filled with—skies, I do not know. And faces. Trapped faces within the River Dusk. I saw that—that maelstrom, and it wanted to devour me and you and—”
“And everything else.” Elias glances down at me, and those pale eyes I learned to love darken. Some unfathomable emotion flickers across them, an echo of who he was.
“We can travel together.” I touch his arm, and he starts at the spark that jumps between us. He’s still human. Still here. “We can speak to the Fakirs, the Kehannis. You could ask—”
At the chill in his gaze, I cease. I keep trying to appeal to his humanity. I might as well throw myself against a stone wall. He does not give two figs about me. He cares about the Waiting Place. He cares about the ghosts.
“How many ghosts have you passed, Elias? How much rot have you seen?”
He tilts his head, contemplating me.
“It’s not because of me,” I say. “Something is wrong. What if it is the Nightbringer’s doing? You are dedicated to protecting and passing on the ghosts. The Tribal Fakirs are also dedicated to the dead. They might know where the rot is coming from.”
Stay with me, I think. Stay with me so I can remind you of who you used to be.
“A rider approaches.” Elias glances over my shoulder. The sky pales enough that I can see foam on the waves, and I squint toward the western horizon, searching.
“Tribespeople,” I say. “Musa told them I was coming. They must have scouts watching the forest.”
“Not the Tribes. Someone else.” Elias takes a step back. “The voice in your head, Laia,” he says, and I remember then that I told him of Rehmat. “Beware of it. Such creatures are never quite what they seem.”
I stare at him in surprise. “I did not know you were listening.”
Hooves thunder from behind me. A quarter mile to the northwest, a band of men and horses appears atop a hill. Even at a distance, one of the forms flickers strangely. It swings its head toward me.
Two sun eyes penetrate across the distance, pinning me like an insect on a wall.
“Elias,” I whisper. “Elias, it’s a jinn—”
Silence. I turn to him, to ask him to windwalk us away. But as I scan the tree line, my stomach sinks. He is gone.
