Chapter 35
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
Austin and Lucy were only ten minutes from the house when Jimmy’s voice appeared on the radio. “Heron Avenue. Officer down.” He sounded like a tired, ragged version of himself. His voice had lost all its usual confidence and vigor. “Stab wound to the belly. Anna Downey being held by… someone. Looked exactly like Lorraine D’Antonia. But dark hair. Heard a baby. Did not see. Repeat: Joshua Green likely alive but did not confirm. Over.”
Lucy was speeding down Hansville Highway through sheets of rain, hands gripping the wheel so tight her knuckles were turning white.
After a bunch of cross-chatter, including Ridley ordering an ambulance and saying he was only a minute away, Lucy punched the radio button. “Jimmy, this is Lucy. You are okay. We will be there soon. Over.” She waited. “Jimmy, say something. Over.”
Austin said, “Jimmy, hold the wound edges together to control the bleeding, and try not to move, unless you can reposition yourself to help close the wound.”
Ridley’s voice came on next. “Jimmy, hold on. Ambulance was in the area for another call. Two minutes out. What else did you see? Jimmy?”
“Jimmy?” Lucy shouted.
They sat for what seemed like an eternity, radio silent. The rain stopped suddenly as they began heading down into Hansville.
Everything was silent except for the whoosh of the tires on the wet road.
Lucy had tears in her eyes. “Jimmy. Say something damnit!”
“Suspect fled. Heard ca- car start.” A long pause. “Possibly white SU… SUV.” Another pause. “Look on.. table. Ev- ev- ev…idence. Bag. Folder. Adoption ag- ag- a-. Oh, no.”
A clatter, then silence. The radio dropping to the floor.
* * *
The ambulance beat them to the scene. When Lucy pulled to a stop in the muddy driveway and leapt out, paramedics already had Jimmy in the back. Before they could get a look, the doors slammed shut and the ambulance peeled away.
Ridley met them on the porch.
“Did you get a look?” Lucy asked. “How was he?” Austin thought she was trying to sound calmer than she actually was.
Ridley grimaced. “Puncture wound to the belly. Not good. If the ambulance wasn’t nearby…” he shook his head. “Even so, the blood loss…” He looked at the ground. “He’d passed out. Didn’t say anything.”
“But he was alive?” Lucy asked.
Ridley nodded. “Barely.”
“Out of our hands now,” Austin said. “Best thing we can do is catch her so when he gets out of surgery—alive—we can deliver good news.”
“We’ve set up a blockade at Eglon Road. No one is leaving Hansville without being stopped. Based on the timing, we think she’s still on the peninsula. We’ve got every available officer on the way. They will knock on every door, talk to every resident.”
Hansville was twenty-eight square miles, only a little bigger than Manhattan, but with a tenth of one percent of the population. He had no doubt they’d be able to find her if she was in someone’s house, but… “What about the woods and beaches?”
“Should we involve the community?” Lucy asked.
Ridley sighed. “It’s a tough one. If this were simply a missing person, then yeah. But do we want old ladies combing the forests for a murderer?”
“Teams,” Austin said. “Teams of twenty or thirty, walking every park, every patch of forest. We can organize it at my place.”
“Okay, but let’s check out the house first.” Ridley led them into the bloody scene in the living room. Jimmy had lost a lot of blood, assuming it was all his.
Austin’s read of the scene said it was. “So, Jimmy approaches the house, sees Anna’s SUV. He knocks and no one answers.”
“How do you know Bonner didn't let him in?” Lucy asked.
“The chill in the air.” He led her into the kitchen and pointed at the broken door. “Figured a door or window had been busted.” Returning to the living room, he added, “Plus, Jimmy wrestled in high school, right?”
Lucy nodded.
“Six-feet, maybe a hundred eighty pounds of pure muscle? No way Mary Bonner overpowers him if they’re face to face. No way she gets the jump on him.” He pointed at the front door. “So, Jimmy knocks, no one answers. He hears something, sees something, or maybe figures out Anna is in there because of his car. He breaks down the side door, sees the kitchen, sees Anna through the doorway. She’s likely had her mouth gagged so she can’t warn him, he walks into the living room and…” he pointed at the empty crib next to the fireplace, “Joshua is there and Mary Bonner is hiding there, behind the door.” Austin went back to the kitchen and slowly walked through the doorway, pretending to hold a gun. “As he walks through the doorway, he spots the crib. I’m guessing that’s what distracted him. He sees Bonner out of the corner of his eye, turns and BAM, the knife is in his stomach.” He dropped to his knees, holding his stomach. “Gun falls out of his hands and slides…” He crawled over to the couch. “Here.” He lay flat on his belly and shined his cell phone’s flashlight under the couch, revealing Jimmy’s firearm.
Lucy knelt beside him and peered at the gun. “Damn, you’re good.”
Austin stood. “Done this a couple times.”
“Don’t touch it,” Ridley said. “We’ll bag it later. So we know what we’re dealing with. Mary Bonner is older, but fit, strong, and not afraid to kill a cop. No knife here, so she has it with her.”
“Probably used it to threaten Anna,” Lucy said. “Get her to drive.”
When they walked into the kitchen, Austin almost doubled-over, sick to his stomach. It wasn’t the bag that did it. He’d seen that right away. What he hadn’t seen was the canning pot, silver and glimmering on the small stove. In all his time investigating Lorraine D’Antonia, they’d never found physical evidence of what she did with the bodies.
Ridley was at the table. “Bag is empty. Poem in this notebook. On the radio, didn’t Jimmy say something about a folder, something about the orphanage?”
“He did.” Austin scanned the floor and kitchen counter. “Maybe she grabbed it when she bolted, but why grab that and not the bag, right next to it?”
Ridley flared his temples. “She made the transition. Her focus is no longer on her sick and twisted manner of killing. It’s on not getting caught. Something in those papers would have helped us catch her. Either way, Mary Bonner is somewhere in Hansville.”
“And we’re going to find her,” Lucy said.
Austin took one more look around the kitchen. The Christmas gift bag on the table, the notebook with the poem, the canning pot. Jimmy said he’d heard a baby cry, which meant Joshua was alive, or at least that he had been an hour ago.
He nodded to Lucy. “You’re damn right we’re going to find her.”
