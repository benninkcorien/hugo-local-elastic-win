Chapter 31
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
In the foreground of the polaroid, three women held up what looked like shots of tequila in a dimly lit bar, their faces illuminated by a camera flash that made them look unnaturally bright in the dark room. Austin recognized Myrian Brightstone, though not the two other women.
Sitting in a barstool to Brightstone’s left, just outside the range of the flash, was The Holiday Baby Butcher. Her face largely shadowed, her hand was blurred, raised up to right under her chin as though she’d been reaching up to block her face.
It couldn’t be her, but there she was. Her hair was a different color, darker brown and cut short. But it was the same lean, bony face that had haunted Austin’s dreams. The same sharp nose and chin. And the eyes. He could have picked those cruel, dead eyes out of a lineup. If that wasn’t Lorraine D’Antonia, it was a woman who’d had a lot of cosmetic surgery to look like her.
The covered porch protected them from what had become a heavy rainfall, and Austin turned away from the door to hold the photo in the little light that crept through. “How the hell—”
“I know, f’ugly right?” Brightstone said. “What did she do, anyway?”
“When was it taken?” Austin demanded.
“Christmas, two years ago.”
“And this is Mary Bonner?” Lucy asked.
“Sure is.”
Austin studied the photo, looking from the face of Mary Bonner to the two women doing shots next to Brightstone. “They are…”
“Jessie Johnson and uhh….” Brightstone scratched her head. “Marcia something. She only worked there like six months.”
“Can we have this?” Lucy asked.
“Sure, but—”
Lucy stuffed a card into Brightstone’s hand. “Call me if you think of anything else she’s ever said to you that might be relevant to finding her.” She grabbed the photo and leapt down from the porch.
Austin jogged after her, joining her in the car.
“What the hell is going on?” Lucy asked.
Austin looked again at the photo. It was odd, on first glance he’d been sure it was Lorraine D’Antonia. But the longer he looked, the more subtle differences he saw. The hair was the most obvious difference, but there was something different in the faces, too. Not in the shape or bone structure, those looked remarkably similar. But something about the complexion, the skin. D’Antonia had clear skin, not pale but not especially tanned. Like she’d spent a lot of time inside. Bonner, on the other hand, looked a little more worn, her skin a little more leathery, like she’d spent a good deal of time working outside or, more likely, under the bright lamps of a tanning bed.
When he didn’t reply, Lucy said, “What I don’t get is, what are the odds of having a woman who looks somewhat like D’Antonia drop the bones on the beach, then finding another woman who looks exactly like her working at the hospital where the missing kids were born? I mean, what the hell is going on here?”
“I don’t know,” Austin said. “Best guess, this is a woman obsessed with the case, and crazy as hell. Probably already looked like her and got cosmetic surgeries, then started copying her kidnappings, her murders. A lot of serial killers have had copycats. She’s just taking it to a new level.”
Lucy was dialing her phone. “Ridley, check out the photo Austin is sending you.”
He snapped a picture and texted it to Ridley.
Lucy waited. “You get it yet?” She listened. “Right. We know.” She tapped her phone, putting it on speaker.
Ridley’s deep voice filled the car. “We’ve had two officers at Mary Bonner’s apartment all day. Nothing. Hospital administrator says she still hasn’t shown up for work. I’ll send this to Samantha and have her edit for the clearest version we can get and spread it far and wide. I’ll call Sheriff Daniels. This isn’t something I can keep from him. Obviously, the FBI profile team needs to see it as well.”
Austin asked, “Either of you seen a case where a copycat gets cosmetic surgery to look more like a perp?”
Lucy shook her head.
“No,” Ridley said, but there are other options. “Austin, how sure are you that D’Antonia doesn’t have a sister?”
“I went deep into her background. She was adopted, but no record of any sister.”
Lucy asked, “And the other option?”
Ridley let out a long stream of air. “Ridiculous as this sounds, maybe that’s not Lorraine D’Antonia in prison right now.”
The thought had crossed Austin’s mind in the same way a dozen ridiculous notions crossed his mind every week before he dismissed them. If Lorraine D’Antonia had escaped from prison, she’d somehow found someone who looked like her to take her spot. Not possible. “That was her on the video. You spoke with her. It was her.”
“I know,” Ridley said. “I know. It’s insane. It’s either the most obsessed copycat ever, or a sister no one knows about.”
A long-buried thought about D’Antonia’s upbringing wiggled from the edge of his brain to the center until it crowded out everything else. What if he’d missed something? Then he remembered the article about the adoption agency that Jimmy had mentioned.
“What about the Heron Avenue thing?” Lucy asked.
“No houses listed to Bonner, or D’Antonia, or any members of either of their families. Probably just Anna doing crazy Anna stuff. That woman is relentless. The house was on Jimmy’s list to check out today, though. He may have already crossed it off the list.”
Austin’s phone dinged with another text from Anna Downey.
It was only a single word.
Help.
