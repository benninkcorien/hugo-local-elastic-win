Chapter 43
CHAPTER FORTY-THREE
Austin leapt up and tried to race toward the door, but staggered into the stove and careened off the steaming pot. It fell, splashing scalding hot water onto his clothes and soaking through his shoes, burning his feet. He slipped, smashing into the counter and crushing the carafe of his coffee pot with his shoulder. As he fell, glass and water were everywhere.
Then he realized the knife was still in his arm.
The first rule of a knife wound was not to remove the knife. But that was assuming you were going to seek medical attention. If he chased after Bonner with the knife in his arm, it could cause even more damage than removing it. Grabbing a wooden spoon from a drawer, he bit down hard, then braced himself for the pain and yanked the knife out. He spat out the spoon and dropped the knife in the sink, then tore a dishrag lengthwise and used a strip to tie a tourniquet just above the puncture. He flicked off the burners and ran for the door.
A nearly full moon cast silvery light over the yard and glimmered off the metal gate, which Bonner had left open when she fled. He ran to it, checking for footprints. Crouching, he pulled out his phone and trained the flashlight on the ground. It was still moist from the rain and there were clear tracks leading away from his yard toward the beach.
He saw her the moment he hit the sand. Lights from the beachfront properties cast sharp, angular patches of light onto the beach, leaving other stretches shadowed. Carrying Joshua Green in her arms, Mary Bonner ran along the stretch he’d just walked, back toward Point No Point. In and out of the patches of light, in and out of shadow, she ran faster than he would have thought possible while carrying a baby. Or maybe he was running slower than he thought. With his bruised hip, gashed head, and punctured arm, he was limping in more ways than one.
He heard sirens in the distance. They’d be at his house within the minute. He knew this patch of beach had no signal, and he wouldn’t risk slowing long enough to make a call even if there was.
He was gaining on Bonner, running at least half again her speed. The shoulder wound wasn’t terrible, but he was also losing blood. The more he ran, the worse it felt.
Mary Bonner entered the stretch of beach next to the lighthouse and, for a moment, she disappeared up the path toward the parking lot. The same path he’d walked with Sarah and Benny.
Austin hit the path, accelerating up the gentle slope. He stopped. She was gone. The parking lot appeared empty.
He tried to quiet his breath, listening in the semi-darkness. He heard nothing, not a twig creaking, not a car door opening or closing. Nothing.
He tried the lighthouse door. Locked. Inside was dark and silent.
He was about to try to kick in the door when he saw movement.
Past the lighthouse, a path led through a small section of marshlands, then up a long wooden staircase to the bluff above the beach, the same spot Sarah and Benny had been when Trisha dropped the bag of bones. He sprinted down the path, reaching the bottom of the wooden staircase when Bonner was halfway up.
“Stop,” he called.
Austin took the stairs three at a time, right on her heels now. When she reached the top of the path, she veered suddenly toward the water, dodging a bench and disappearing in a gap in the brush where the blackberry brambles had been cut down.
For a second he thought she was going to dive off the bluff at full speed, but she stopped a yard away from the edge and turned, gripping Joshua tight in her arms. “Do not… come closer.” She was panting, her hair and eyes wild. Joshua had stopped crying.
Austin could not see if he was breathing. Oh, God, let him be breathing.
Austin stopped on the other side of the bench, maybe ten yards from Bonner. His breath was ragged. “Is… he…al- alive?”
“He’s resting.”
“It’s over, Mary.”
She backed up a pace. “I will throw him over the ledge.”
Austin couldn’t see the shore, but he’d been up on this bluff before. Thirty feet below, driftwood and jagged rocks populated the beach. A strong adult would have a tough time surviving a fall. Joshua would have no chance. “You don’t want to do that.” He stretched both arms out in front of him, palms up, trying to make himself as unthreatening as possible. “Just stay steady. Set Joshua down and walk away. I swear to you, I will not pursue you. I only want the baby. You can be safely in Seattle in a couple hours. Please. Just leave Joshua.”
Her face was pure pain, a dark scowl of loss and anger. “You have no idea what you did to me, did to us.”
“Tell me, then. Let’s talk it through. Just set the baby on the ground.” He inched closer. “Tell me about Lorraine.”
She looked at the ground as though considering his offer, then gripped Joshua tighter.
“If you don’t want to tell me about Lorraine, tell me about Trisha.”
Bonner looked confused.
“The woman you asked to bring the bag to the beach. Did you hire her because she looks a little like you? A little like Lorraine?”
“I thought if someone saw her…” She shook her head violently, like she was trying to force something loose. “If someone saw her they might arrest her and then think she did all the… all the…”
“Killings?”
Bonner nodded. She only barely thought of what she and D’Antonia had done as killings, and couldn’t say the word.
“All of this was so they’d let Lorraine go, right?”
Bonner nodded. “They split us apart when we were babies. Our mother did not want us but she wanted us to stay together. They promised her they would keep us together! It’s all in the papers.” Her voice had become the pained shriek of a dying animal. “They split us apart.” She stopped to take a few angry breaths, then continued. “Lorraine was put with a rich family. Italian. A good family. Owned a chain of restaurants. She got chicken Parmesan, fresh-baked bread and a fluffy bed. I was raised by the Bonners.” She almost spat the name. “I got milk toast and a dog cage.”
Austin inched closer, hands still outstretched. “I’m sorry.” She was right about Lorraine D’Antonia’s background. She’d been raised in relative wealth, with parents who owned five or six Italian restaurants in Seattle. Fiona had told him once that D’Antonia’s murders were proof that nature mattered more than nurture. After all, D’Antonia had been given every advantage and had turned into one of the most sadistic killers in history.
He took another step forward. “I really am sorry. And you didn’t deserve what happened to you. No one deserves that. When did you and Lorraine meet?”
She smiled, her face illuminated by moonlight filtering through the trees above them. “We found each other more than thirty years ago.”
“Before the news about the orphanage?” He was even more surprised than he let on. He took another tiny step forward. “I assumed you’d met when the news broke of the twins study.”
She grimaced at the mention of the study. She was only a few feet from the cliff and she leaned toward the water, as though she might just let herself fall backwards, taking Joshua with her. “Don’t come any closer.”
He stopped. “Okay, just tell me more. Let’s keep talking and see what we can work out here.”
“We met because of nursing school. She had gone to UW. Her parents paid. I went to community college. I washed dishes to pay my way. A nurse I was shadowing told me she’d had a nursing student a few years earlier who looked exactly like me. I ignored it at first, but she showed me a photo, and I knew it was her. I’d always felt like a piece of me was missing, and I finally knew what it was. Lorraine and I met a little later.”
Austin heard a twig snap to his left, from the bushes halfway up the staircase. He didn’t allow his head to move but he shifted his eyes just long enough to see Anna Downey, crouched and creeping, clinging close to the bushes that framed the staircase. “So let me see if I can understand, because I want to understand, Mary, I really do.” He shifted to the right slightly, drawing Mary Bonner’s eyes with him, away from Anna. “You think I might be only out to stop you. But I genuinely want to understand what happened. I want to understand you.”
She nodded.
“So tell me if I have this right. You meet Lorraine while you’re in nursing school, and you form a relationship. Immediately you start discovering all the ways you’re similar, despite having such different upbringings.” From the corner of his eye, he saw Anna reach the top of the stairs. On her hands and knees, she moved in the shadows toward the cliff. “But at some point Lorraine begins acting strange, becoming erratic, maybe even cruel. She starts talking more and more about her childhood, complaining that she hadn’t had her real mother, that nothing was as it should have been. And part of that, you could agree with. You’d had it rougher than her, after all.” Anna was only about twenty feet away, hiding behind the trunk of a large evergreen that hugged the cliff. “And I’m guessing that she told you about her plans even before she carried them out. Her plans to begin taking babies. But you’re not like her, Mary. She’s your sister and you love her, so you didn’t stop her, but I bet you knew that what she was doing was wrong. That’s why you didn’t help her. She was given everything and went on to do very bad things. You had it much more difficult, and the only reason you started doing these things was out of love. You wanted her to be released from prison. You thought that if babies started turning up dead in the same way, they’d have to let her go. Do I have that right?”
Mary Bonner was silent for a long moment, then let out the most disturbing laugh he’d ever heard. It wasn’t the high-pitched cackle of a movie villain. It was a low, hoarse grumble, a mocking laughter that carried a darkness blacker than midnight. When she spoke, her voice was as dark as the laugh. “No, Thomas Austin. You have it completely backwards.”
Anna bolted suddenly for Bonner, shoulder lowered. She was about to connect with her side, but when she was a yard away she tripped, colliding with Bonner’s legs just as the woman turned. Joshua fell from her arms, letting out a sharp cry as he fell onto Anna’s back and rolled onto the soggy ground.
Austin leapt forward, but it was too late.
Kicking violently, Bonner connected with Anna’s side, then lunged for Joshua. Anna rolled and reached Joshua first, snatching the baby as she slid toward the ledge. She gripped him tight in her arms and, for half a second, Austin thought she’d saved him.
Then Mary Bonner dropped to her knees and used the momentum of Anna’s slide to push them off the bluff.
