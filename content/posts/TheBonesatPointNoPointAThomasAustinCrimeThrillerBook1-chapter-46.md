Chapter 45
CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE
A sickened, broken feeling took over Austin’s whole body. He tasted moldy oatmeal flecked with the burnt-toast bitterness of dread. He did not know what she meant, but somehow he knew she was telling the truth. He could only manage two words. “Tell me.”
“Lorraine was the good one. When we met she was already a successful nurse. I was in school. We thought it was funny that we both decided to be nurses even though we’d never met. Must be in the blood. We were so similar, and yet so different.”
“How?” Austin asked.
“She had grown up rich. Private schools, nice parents. Of course she’d wondered why our mother didn’t want us, but she had had a good life. She was prettier than me, too.”
“What did I get wrong?”
“I’m the one who killed the babies. Not her. It was me the whole time.”
“That’s not possible. Sonya Lopez in New York. We had video evidence. DNA. A confession.”
“Oh, she killed Sonya Lopez. Because I asked her to. But little Sonya was the only one she killed. You’re not as good a detective as you think you are.”
Austin’s mind raced. When she’d been sent back from New York to Seattle, Lorraine D’Antonia had confessed to all the murders in Seattle. She’d been off on some of the details, but she knew enough that the confessions seemed legitimate. “The details of the Seattle killings…”
“She couldn’t remember everything I told her.”
Austin doubled over, his stomach turning as his mind flashed back on the thousand moments he’d spent interrogating D’Antonia. He didn’t want to know but he had to know. “Jonathan Gruber. Seattle. 2015.”
“He was chubby, just like little Joshua. I took him. I killed him. She confessed.”
“And the others?”
“All me.”
“So why—”
“In 2018, I read in the paper that Seattle detectives were closing in on a suspect in the killings. Lorraine had moved away by then, was already living in New York. I begged her to do it. Told her exactly what to do. Made her do it when I was at work so they’d know I was innocent. That’s why she only did the one in New York.”
“You had her kill Sonya Lopez so detectives would think they’d been on the wrong suspect in Seattle?”
She nodded. “We didn’t think she would get caught.”
“And when I caught her, she confessed to all the killings to protect you?”
She nodded. “So they’d never come looking for me again.”
They stood in silence, staring at each other. Her face ran through an odd series of contortions, like she was feeling a dozen emotions at once.
Finally she said, “Do you have a soulmate, Detective Austin?”
“I do. I mean, I did. I still do.”
“Your wife?”
He nodded.
“I had one, too, until they took her away. Until you took her away.”
”But how could she kill? How could you convince her to?”
“Would you have killed for your wife?”
“Not like this. Not an innocent baby. Not even for her.”
“Our bond runs deeper even than love.”
It was all coming together in Austin’s mind now. Lorraine D’Antonia was evil, there was no doubt, but she’d had to be pushed to act on it. Mary Bonner got there all by herself. “You can see Lorraine again.” Austin pointed down the bluff toward the parking lot, where swirling red and blue lights lit up the lighthouse and the beach. “Come back with me. I promise I’ll help you see Lorraine again.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, when you’re drinking coffee and playing with your dog… when you’re at your wife’s grave and out on a date and reading your books… when you’re fishing on a boat or taking a shower or eating lunch… now and for the rest of your life, you’ll always have a single thing in the back of your mind. You have the wrong person in prison for four murders. And you will never have the right person.”
Mary Bonner looked up at the rock, smiled faintly, then brought it down with a violent crash into her forehead, knocking herself backwards over the cliff.
The next thing Austin heard was the wet thud of her body smashing into the rocks below.
