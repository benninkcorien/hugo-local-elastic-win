Chapter 19
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The little cabin smelled of sugar, butter, and vanilla. Christmas cookies.
She had no happy memories of the holidays, but she imagined this is what houses were supposed to smell like at Christmas. Some people liked ginger and cinnamon and other spices, but she thought little Joshua would prefer the classics.
Not that she would give him a cookie. He was far too young for that. But still, this was his Christmas, their Christmas, and it was important that it be perfect. It was important to make memories now.
After all, they only had another day or two together.
The old wooden floor creaked as she made her way across the kitchen. On a changing table next to the stove, Joshua lay, sleeping on his stomach. She stood over him, admiring his outfit. She’d dressed him in a red and white onesie with a patch across the back that read “Santa Baby” in cute green cursive. His tiny feet were covered in green elf booties she’d made herself and his head was nestled snugly in a mini Santa hat.
She frowned. She’d forgotten to get him a present. Not that a three-week-old baby needed a present, but it was important to make these memories perfect. She considered running out to the store while he slept, but that would be neglectful. The cookies would have to do.
Joshua was a big eater, and it had taken forever to get him to sleep. The website said that a boy his age would need a maximum of four ounces of formula per feeding. He’d finished off six without coming up for air.
“That’s my big boy,” she said, but not loud enough to wake him.
Her voice sounded odd in the little kitchen—thin and airy like the wind whistling through the cracked window.
With an old-fashioned Polaroid, she snapped a photo of the sleeping little angel. She shook out the photo with one hand, checking on the cookies in the oven with the other. They needed a few more minutes.
She examined the picture. It was her third of Joshua, but definitely the cutest. In the first one he was crying—what a fussy little treasure!—and in the second his Santa hat had slipped down over his eyes. This new one was perfect.
A clothesline ran across the kitchen and she clipped the polaroid in the very center, next to her favorite photo of baby Allie, dressed in a turkey onesie, surrounded by a cornucopia of squash, pumpkins, and cranberries.
Joshua let out a tiny squeal, but didn’t wake. “Hush little baby,” she said, sitting at the kitchen table.
She picked up a pencil and studied what she had so far.
Christmas is
A time for joy
Let’s gather together
Every girl and boy
Stockings and cookies
And presents for all
Bring good cheer and wonder
As winter does call
She let the words roll through her mind and off her tongue in a gentle whisper. Why did her voice sound so strange? Maybe it was because of Joshua. It was as though he might condemn her, criticize her, as silly as that was. What if the poem wasn’t good enough? He was less than a month old; surely he wouldn’t judge her mothering skills. After all, she’d done everything she could to make Christmas perfect.
Her eyes wandered across the kitchen. Through the window, she saw a pair of eagles, looping and gliding around each other as though engaged in a secret aerial dance. She wondered whether they were potential mates, brother and sister, or father and son. She didn’t know, but they struck her as family. Just like her and Joshua had become.
She considered rhyming eagle with regal. What holiday was more regal than Christmas? But she didn’t think eagles were especially Christmassy, so she dismissed the idea.
Her eyes landed on the giant canning pot covering both burners on the two-burner stove. That made her think of jam and holiday-spiced apple butter. One year she’d canned a holiday salt scrub scented with ginger and cloves. Maybe there was a way to work that into the poem.
She had so many wonderful Christmas ideas, and so little time.
