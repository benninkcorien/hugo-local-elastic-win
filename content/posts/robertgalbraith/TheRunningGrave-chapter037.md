The Running Grave
37
Through resoluteness one is certain to encounter something.
Hence there follows the hexagram of COMING TO MEET.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
If the receipt of Robin’s letter from Chapman Farm didn’t have quite the same effect on Strike as his had on her, the absence of a note for Ryan Murphy cheered him enormously, a fact he concealed from Dev Shah when the latter confirmed that there’d been only one letter inside the plastic rock when he’d checked before dawn.
‘Well, good to know she’s OK,’ was Strike’s only comment, after reading Robin’s message at the partners’ desk. ‘And that’s a pretty bloody big piece of information she’s got already. If Will Edensor’s fathered a kid in there, we’ve got a partial explanation of why he’s not leaving.’
‘Yeah,’ said Dev. ‘Fear of prosecution. Statutory rape, isn’t it? Gonna tell Sir Colin?’
Strike hesitated, frowning as he rubbed his chin.
‘If the kid’s definitely Will’s he’ll have to know eventually, but I’d rather get a bit more information first.’
‘Underage is underage,’ said Dev.
Strike had never seen Shah look that uncompromising before.
‘I agree. But I’m not sure you can judge what goes on in there by normal standards.’
‘Fuck normal standards,’ said Dev. ‘Keep your dick in your pants around kids.’
There was a short, charged silence, following which Dev announced that he needed to get some sleep, having been up all night in the car, and departed.
‘What’s upset him?’ enquired Pat, as the glass door closed rather harder than necessary and Strike emerged from the inner office with an empty mug in his hand.
‘Sex with underage girls,’ said Strike, moving towards the sink to wash up the mug before heading out for more surveillance on Bigfoot. ‘Not Dev,’ he added.
‘Well, I knew that,’ said Pat.
How Pat could know that, Strike didn’t ask. Dev was easily the most handsome subcontractor employed by the agency and Strike knew from experience that their office manager’s sympathies were most readily engaged by good-looking men. An association of ideas led him to say,
‘Incidentally, if Ryan Murphy calls, tell him there’s no note for him from Robin this week.’
Something in Pat’s sharp glance made Strike say,
‘There wasn’t one in the rock.’
‘All right, I’m not accusing you of burning it,’ snapped Pat, turning back to her typing.
‘Everything all right?’ asked Strike. While he doubted anyone had ever compared Pat to a ray of eternal sunshine, he couldn’t offhand remember her being this tetchy without provocation.
‘Fine,’ said Pat, e-cigarette waggling as she scowled at her monitor.
Strike decided the politic course was to wash his mug in silence.
‘Well, that’s me off to watch Bigfoot,’ he said. As he turned to get his coat, his eye fell on a small pile of receipts on Pat’s desk.
‘Those Littlejohn’s?’
‘Yeah,’ said Pat, her fingers moving rapidly over the keys.
‘Mind if I have a quick look?’
He shuffled through them. There was nothing unusual or extravagant in there; indeed, if anything, they were on the sketchy side.
‘What d’you think of Littlejohn?’ Strike asked Pat, setting the receipts back down beside her.
‘What d’you mean, what do I think of him?’ she said, glaring up at him.
‘Exactly what I said.’
‘He’s all right,’ said Pat, after a moment or two. ‘He’s fine.’
‘Robin told me you don’t like him.’
‘I thought he was a bit quiet when he started, that’s all.’
‘Got chattier, has he?’ said Strike.
‘Yeah,’ said Pat. ‘Well – no – but he’s always polite.’
‘You’ve never noticed him doing anything odd? Behaving strangely? Lying about anything?’
‘No. Why’re you asking me this?’ said Pat.
‘Because if you had, you wouldn’t be the only one,’ said Strike. He was now intrigued: Pat had never before shown the slightest inclination to pull her punches when judging anyone: client, employee or, indeed, Strike himself.
‘He’s fine. Doing the job OK, isn’t he?’
Before Strike could answer, the phone on Pat’s desk rang.
‘Oh, hello Ryan,’ she said, her tone far warmer.
Strike decided it was time to leave, and did so, closing the glass door quietly behind him.
The next few days yielded little progress in the UHC case. There was no word from Shanker on a possible interview with Jordan Reaney. Cherie Gittins remained unfindable on every database Strike consulted. Of the witnesses to Cherie and Daiyu’s early morning swim, the café owner who’d seen Cherie taking the child down to the beach while carrying towels had died five years previously. He’d tried to contact Mr and Mrs Heaton, who’d seen the hysterical Cherie running up the beach after Daiyu disappeared beneath the waves, and who were still living at an address in Cromer, but nobody ever answered their landline, no matter what time of day Strike tried it. He toyed with the idea of driving on to Cromer after visiting Garvestone Hall, but as the agency was already stretched with its current cases, and he was already planning to go down to Cornwall later in the week, he decided against sacrificing another few hours on the road merely to find an unoccupied house.
His drive to Norfolk on a sunny Tuesday morning was uneventful until, on a flat, straight stretch of the A11, Midge called him about the most recently acquired case on the agency’s books, a case of presumed marital infidelity in which the husband wanted the wife watched. The client had been taken on so recently that no nickname had been assigned to either client or target, although Strike understood who Midge was talking about when she said without preamble,
‘I’ve caught Mrs What’s-Her-Name in the act.’
‘Already?’
‘Yeah. Got pictures of her coming out of the lover’s flat this morning. Visiting her mother, my arse. Maybe I should’ve strung it out a bit. We’re not going to make much out of this one.’
‘Good word of mouth, though,’ said Strike.
‘Shall I get Pat to notify the next on the waiting list?’
‘Let’s give it a week,’ said Strike, after a sight hesitation. ‘The Frank job needs twice the manpower now we know it’s both of them. Listen, Midge, while I’ve got you – is there anything up with Pat and Littlejohn?’
‘What d’you mean?’
‘There hasn’t been a row or anything?’
‘Not that I know of.’
‘She was a bit odd when I asked her what she thought of him, this morning.’
‘Well, she doesn’t like him,’ said Midge. ‘None of us do,’ she added, with her usual candour.
‘I’m putting out feelers for a replacement,’ said Strike, which was true: he’d emailed several contacts in both the police and the army for possible candidates the previous evening. ‘OK, good work on Mrs Thing. I’ll see you tomorrow.’
He drove on through the relentlessly flat landscape, which was having its usual lowering effect on his mood. The Aylmerton Community had forever tainted Norfolk in his mind; he found no beauty in the seeming immensity of the sky pressing down upon the level earth, nor for its occasional windmills and marshy wetlands.
His satnav guided him along a series of narrow, winding country lanes, until he finally saw his first signpost to Garvestone. Three hours after he’d left London, he entered the tiny village, passing a square-towered church, school and village hall in rapid succession and finding himself out the other side barely three minutes later. A quarter of a mile beyond Garvestone he spotted a wooden sign directing him up a track to his right to the hall. Shortly thereafter, he was driving through the open gates towards what had once been home to the Stolen Prophet.
