The Running Grave
90
Now it is the time of struggle.
The transition must be completed.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Five days after Robin had left Chapman Farm, Strike set out from the office at midday to meet Sir Colin Edensor for a full update on the UHC case. Over Robin’s protestations, Strike had insisted she take a full week off work, because he remained concerned about both her mental and physical health, and was glad to hear that her parents had come down from Yorkshire to stay with her.
Sir Colin, who’d only just returned from a week’s holiday with his eldest son’s family, naturally wanted a full update on Robin’s discoveries without delay. As he was coming into central London for a charity board meeting, he offered Strike lunch at Rules restaurant in Covent Garden. While Strike feared the comfortable glamour of the old restaurant would provide an incongruous backdrop for revelations that were certain to dismay the retired civil servant, he had no objection to being offered a full cooked lunch and therefore accepted. However, he resolved to resist pudding, and chose to walk to Covent Garden from the office, in tribute to his continued commitment to weight loss.
He’d been en route for five minutes, enjoying the sunshine, when his mobile rang and he saw Lucy’s number.
‘Hey,’ he said, answering, ‘what’s up?’
‘I’ve just got back from the specialist, with Ted.’
‘Oh Christ, sorry,’ said Strike, with a familiar gut-twist of guilt. ‘I should’ve called you. It’s been a very busy week. What’s the news?’
‘Well, the specialist was very nice and very thorough,’ said Lucy, ‘but he definitely doesn’t think Ted’s fit to live alone any more.’
‘OK,’ said Strike. ‘Good to know going back to the old house isn’t an option. What was Ted’s reaction? Did he take it all in?’
‘He sort of nodded along while we were there, but he’s literally just told me he thinks he ought to be getting home. I’ve found him packing twice in the last few days, although if you distract him he’s completely happy to come downstairs and watch TV or have something to eat. I just don’t know what to do next.’
‘Is Greg agitating to get him out of the spare room?’
‘Not agitating,’ said Lucy defensively, ‘but we’ve talked it through and I suppose it would be hard having Ted to live with us while we’re both working. Ted would still be alone for most of the day.’
‘Luce, I think it’s got to be a care home in London.’
He expected his sister to start crying, and wasn’t disappointed.
‘But Joan would’ve hated—’
‘What she’d have hated,’ said Strike firmly, ‘would be for Ted to break his neck trying to get down those stairs, or for him to wander off and get lost again because nobody’s keeping an eye on him. If we sell the house in Cornwall, we’ll be able to get him into a good place up here where both of us can visit.’
‘But his roots – Cornwall’s all he’s ever—’
‘It’s not all he’s ever known,’ said Strike. ‘He was a Red Cap for seven years, he went all over the bloody place. I want to know he’s being fed properly, and that someone’s keeping an eye on his health. If he moves up here, we can see him regularly and take him out. It’s a bloody nightmare, him being five and a half hours away, every time something goes wrong. And before you say he’ll miss all his friends, half of them are dead, Luce.’
‘I know, I just…’
‘This is the answer. You know it is.’
He could tell that somewhere beneath Lucy’s distress was relief that he was taking charge, that the decision wasn’t hers alone. After some more reassurance and encouragement, she bade him farewell, sniffing but sounding calmer. This left Strike with a few minutes in which to relegate his own family problems to the back of his mind, and focus on those of the Edensors.
Rules, which Strike had never visited before, lay in Maiden Lane and had an impressive old-world frontage. Upon telling the maître d’ who he was meeting, Strike was shown through the restaurant, of which the walls were bestrewn with antlers, Victorian prints and antique clocks, to a red velvet booth in which Sir Colin, kindly faced as ever, was sitting.
‘Very good of you to meet at my convenience,’ said Sir Colin as they shook hands. He was scanning Strike’s face rather anxiously for some intimation of what he was about to hear.
‘Very grateful for the lunch,’ said Strike, easing himself into the booth. ‘Did you have a good holiday?’
‘Oh, yes, it was wonderful spending some time with the grandchildren,’ said Sir Colin. ‘Constantly thinking how much Sally would have… but anyway…’
A waiter arrived to offer menus and drinks. Both men declined the latter.
‘So, your partner’s out of Chapman Farm?’ said Sir Colin.
‘She is, yes,’ said Strike, ‘and she’s got us a lot of good information. Firstly,’ said Strike, who could see no way of cushioning the worst blow and thought it was best delivered immediately, ‘Will had no idea your wife’s died.’
Sir Colin’s hand went to his mouth.
‘I’m sorry,’ said Strike. ‘I know that must be hard to hear.’
‘But we wrote,’ said Sir Colin shakily, lowering his hand. ‘We wrote multiple times.’
‘Robin found out that church members are pressured to sign a declaration that they don’t want to be given letters from the outside. This seems to be something the church does with people who’ve progressed up a certain number of levels to what they call pure spirit – in other words, people they think they’ve really got their hooks into, and whose isolation they want to cement. From the moment the declaration’s signed, the church withholds all correspondence. It’s supposedly viewable upon request, but from what Robin’s told me, asking to read letters would put a church member in line for immediate demotion to manual labour and possibly punishment.’
Strike fell silent while four rotund men in expensive suits passed the booth, then went on,
‘Someone at the church – probably Mazu Wace, who Robin says is in charge of correspondence – informed Will that you’d written to say his mother was ill. Robin thinks this was probably to cover themselves, in case of legal action from you. She thinks Mazu will have encouraged Will to see this as a ruse to manipulate him, and asked whether he wanted further news. If he’d said “yes”, Robin believes he’d have been punished, possibly severely. In any case, we know no further information about your wife was passed on. When Robin told Will his mother was dead, he was very distressed and went immediately to the church superiors to ask to write to you. I presume you haven’t received any such letter?’
‘No,’ said Sir Colin faintly. ‘Nothing at all.’
‘Well, that’s the last contact with Will Robin had before she escaped, but—’
‘What d’you mean, “escaped”?’
‘She found herself in a dangerous situation and had to run for it, by night.’
A waiter now appeared to take their food order. Strike waited until the man was out of earshot before saying,
‘In slightly better news, Will’s definitely having doubts about the church. Robin witnessed Will challenging a Principal on church doctrine, and Jonathan Wace personally informed Robin that Will keeps getting stuck on step six to pure spirit, which means accepting the church’s teaching, rather than understanding it.’
‘That’s the Will I know,’ said Sir Colin, looking slightly more encouraged.
‘Yeah, that’s obviously good,’ said Strike, wishing he didn’t have to immediately dash any faint hopes he’d raised, ‘but, ah, there’s something else Robin found out, which explains why Will hasn’t followed through on these doubts, and left. I wouldn’t tell you this if we didn’t have very strong reasons for believing it, but he appears to have fathered a child at Chapman Farm.’
‘Oh God,’ said Sir Colin, aghast.
‘Obviously, without a DNA test we can’t be absolutely sure,’ said Strike, ‘but Robin says the little girl looks like Will, and from observing his behaviour with the child and from conversations she overheard in there, she’s certain he’s the father.’
‘Who’s the mother?’
Wishing he had almost any other answer Strike said,
‘She’s called Lin.’
‘Lin… not the one Kevin wrote about? With the stammer?’
‘That’s the one, yes,’ said Strike.
Neither man spoke aloud what Strike was sure was uppermost in Sir Colin’s mind: that Lin was the product of Jonathan Wace’s rape of Deirdre Doherty. Strike now dropped his voice. Little though he wanted to alarm Edensor further, he felt it would be unethical to withhold the next bit of information.
‘I’m afraid it’s likely Lin was underage when she gave birth to Will’s daughter. According to Robin, Lin doesn’t look much older than fifteen or sixteen now, and as far as she could judge, the daughter’s around two years old.’
Strike couldn’t entirely blame Sir Colin for burying his face in his hands. He then took a deep breath, let his hands fall, straightened up in his seat and said quietly,
‘Well, I’m glad James isn’t here.’
Remembering Sir Colin’s eldest son’s rage at Will during their only previous meeting, Strike silently concurred.
‘I think it’s important to remember that it’s a punishable offence at Chapman Farm to refuse to “spirit bond” – in other words, to refuse sex. Will and Lin’s relationship has to be seen in that context. They’d both been groomed to believe spirit bonding wasn’t just acceptable, but righteous.’
‘Even so—’
‘The church doesn’t celebrate birthdays. Lin herself might not know how old she is. Will might have believed she was of age when it happened.’
‘Nevertheless—’
‘I don’t think Lin would want to press charges,’ said Strike, again lowering his voice as a portly middle-aged couple were led past their table. ‘Robin says Lin’s fond of Will and she loves the daughter they had together. Will seems to feel warmly towards Lin, too. Robin thinks that as Will’s doubts about the church have grown, his awareness of what’s considered immoral in the outside world has begun to reassert itself, because he’s now refusing to have sex with her.’
The waiter now arrived with their food. Strike glanced with some envy at Sir Colin’s steak and kidney pudding; he’d ordered sea bass, and he was becoming increasingly bored of fish.
Sir Colin ate a single mouthful, then put down his knife and fork again, looking queasy. Keen to cheer up a client for whom he felt a great deal more empathy than others who’d hired the agency, Strike said,
‘Robin’s got us a few solid leads, though, and I’m hopeful at least one of them will lead to building a case against the church. Firstly, there’s a small boy called Jacob.’
He outlined Jacob’s precarious state of health, the neglect and lack of medical treatment he was enduring, then described Robin’s interview with the police, hours after leaving the church compound.
‘If the authorities manage to gain entry to the farm and examine the boy, which they may already have done, we’ll have something very significant against the UHC. Robin’s expecting to hear back from the police any time now.’
‘Well, that’s certainly – not good news, not for the poor child,’ said Sir Colin, ‘but if we can only put the Waces on the back foot for a change—’
‘Exactly,’ said Strike. ‘And Jacob’s only one of the leads Robin got. The next is Lin herself. She was removed from the farm after having an adverse reaction to some plants she was eating in an attempt to give herself a miscarriage – this wasn’t Will’s child,’ Strike added. ‘As I told you, he’s been refusing to sleep with her now.’
‘What d’you mean by “removed”?’
‘She didn’t want to leave, doubtless because of her daughter, but they took her forcibly off the premises. We haven’t yet been able to trace her yet. No hospital’s admitting to having her. Of course, she might be at one of the other UHC centres, but I’ve done a bit of research and my hunch is that she’s at a residential clinic run by Dr Zhou in Borehamwood.’
‘I know about that place,’ said Sir Colin. ‘Pattersons got one of their people in there to have a look around, but it didn’t turn up anything of value. It seems to be a glorified spa, no obvious wrongdoing and nobody tried to recruit their detective to the UHC.’
‘Even so, it seems the most likely place for them to have hidden Lin. As I say, she was in need of urgent medical care and I don’t think they’d want her anywhere she couldn’t be watched over by a senior member of the church, because she’s a definite flight risk – Robin overheard her suggesting to Will that they do “what Kevin did”.
‘If we can trace Lin and get her out of their clutches, we’d have a very valuable witness. Robin thinks Lin would value getting custody of her daughter over her loyalty to the church, and if we can get the child out, Will might well follow. But I want to tread very carefully in trying to locate Lin, because we don’t want to spook the UHC into hiding her somewhere unreachable. If you’re happy to bear the expense, I’d like to get one of our own people into that clinic – not Robin, obviously, but possibly our other female detective.’
‘Yes, of course. I have a duty of care to the girl. She’s the mother of my granddaughter, after…’
His eyes brimmed with tears.
‘I do apologise… every time we meet I seem to…’
Their waiter now returned to the table to ask Sir Colin whether there was something wrong with his steak and kidney pudding.
‘No,’ said Sir Colin weakly, ‘it’s very good. Just not particularly hungry… so sorry,’ he added to Strike, wiping his eyes as the waiter retreated again. ‘Sally really craved a granddaughter, you know. We run to boys a lot in both our families… but for it to happen under these circumstances…’
Strike waited for Sir Colin to compose himself before continuing.
‘Robin got a third possible lead: one of Kevin Pirbright’s sisters.’
Strike now told the story of Emily’s aborted escape attempt in Norwich.
‘It would mean more costs, I’m afraid,’ Strike said, ‘but I suggest putting one of our people in Norwich, to attempt a direct approach to Emily the next time she goes out collecting money for the church. Robin’s given us a good physical description. She and Emily struck up a rapport in there and I think, if one of our operatives mentions Robin, Emily might be persuaded to leave with them.’
‘Yes, I’d be happy for you to try that,’ said Sir Colin, whose virtually untouched pie was growing cold in front of him. ‘I’d feel as though I were doing something for Kevin, if I helped his sister get out… well,’ said Sir Colin, who was clearly shaken but trying to focus on the positive, ‘your partner’s done an astounding job. She’s achieved more in four months than Pattersons managed in eighteen.’
‘I’ll tell her you said that. It’ll mean a lot to her.’
‘She couldn’t come to lunch?’ asked Sir Colin.
‘No,’ said Strike. ‘I want her to take some time off. She went through a lot in there.’
‘But you wouldn’t want her to testify,’ said Sir Colin, with no hint of a question in his voice. It was a relief to Strike to have an intelligent client, for a change.
‘Not as things stand. The church’s lawyers would have a field day with Robin’s lack of impartiality, given that she was paid to go in there and gather dirt on them. The culture of fear in the church is such that I think they’d close ranks and terrify anyone at Chapman Farm who could back up her account. If she starts talking about supernatural events and torture techniques without corroboration—’
‘Torture techniques?’
‘She was shut up in a box for eight hours, unable to move out of a bent kneeling position.’
As far as Strike could tell in the flattering, diffused lighting, Sir Colin now turned rather pale.
‘Kevin told me he was tied to trees at night and so on, but he never mentioned being locked in a box.’
‘I think it’s reserved for the very worst transgressions,’ said Strike, choosing not to tell Sir Colin that his son, too, had been subjected to the punishment.
He now hesitated, considering how best to frame what he wanted to say next. He was loath to ruin the very slight sense of hope he’d induced in his client, and only too aware that Sir Colin had already committed to tripling the fees he was paying the agency.
‘Robin’s leads have definitely put us in a far better position than we were in,’ he said. ‘If we’re lucky, and we get Lin and Emily out, and they’re prepared to talk, and if there’s a police investigation into Jacob, we’ll definitely land a few heavy punches on the church.’
‘But those are significant “ifs”,’ said Sir Colin.
‘Right,’ said Strike. ‘We’ve got to be realistic. The Waces are adept at batting off critics. They could choose a few scapegoats to take the blame for everything Robin, Lin and Emily allege – and that’s assuming the other two are prepared to testify. They might not be up to taking the stand against a church that’s intimidated and coerced them for most of their lives.’
‘No,’ said Edensor, ‘I can see we’d better not count our chickens yet.’
‘I keep going back to something Wace’s eldest daughter said to me,’ said Strike. ‘Words to the effect of “It’s like cancer. You’ve got to cut the whole thing out, or you’ll be back where you started.”’
‘But how do you cut out something that’s metastasised across continents?’
‘Well,’ said Strike, ‘there might be a way. Did Kevin ever talk to you in any depth about Daiyu?’
‘Daiyu?’ said Sir Colin, looking puzzled. ‘Oh, you mean the Drowned Prophet? No more than he put in the blog and emails I gave you. Why?’
‘Because the one sure-fire way of bringing down the church would be to dismantle the myth of the Drowned Prophet. If we could smash the central pillar of their whole belief system—’
‘That’s surely rather ambitious?’ said Sir Colin. As Strike had feared, he now looked slightly mistrustful.
‘I’ve been looking into what actually happened on that beach in Cromer and I’ve got a lot of questions. I’ve now tracked down the key witness: Cherie Gittins, the woman who took Daiyu to the beach where she drowned. I’m hoping to interview her shortly. And then we’ve got Kevin’s murder.’
At that moment, the waiter came to collect their plates and offer the pudding menu. Both men declined, but asked for coffee.
‘What about Kevin’s murder?’ said Sir Colin, when the waiter had gone.
‘I’m afraid,’ said Strike, ‘I think it far more likely that the UHC had Kevin killed, than that he was dealing drugs.’
‘But—’
‘Initially, I was of your opinion. I couldn’t see why they’d need to shoot him. They’ve got excellent lawyers and he was undoubtedly unstable and easy to discredit. But the longer the investigation’s gone on, the less I’ve bought the drug-dealing theory.’
‘Why? What have you found out?’
‘Most recently, I’ve heard an unsubstantiated allegation that there have been guns at Chapman Farm. The source was second-hand,’ Strike admitted, ‘and not particularly trustworthy, so I’ll have to try and confirm his account, but the fact remains I think it would be unwise to underestimate the kinds of contacts the UHC have made over the last thirty years. There were no guns found in the raid on the farm in eighty-six, but since then they’ve had at least one violent criminal living at the farm. All they needed was a recruit who knew where to lay hands on guns illegally – assuming Wace didn’t already have that knowledge.’
‘You really think they murdered Kevin because of his book?’ said Sir Colin, sounding sceptical.
‘I don’t think the book, in and of itself, was a problem, because a journalist I interviewed called Fergus Robertson had already accused the UHC of pretty much everything Kevin was alleging: physical assault, sexual abuse and supernatural mind games. The church went after Robertson hard with lawyers, but he’s still alive.’
Their coffees arrived.
‘So what was the motive, if not the book?’ said Sir Colin.
‘Kevin told you he was piecing things together during the last weeks of his life, didn’t he? Things he thought he’d suppressed?’
‘Yes – as I told you, he was becoming increasingly erratic and troubled. I deeply regret that I didn’t offer more support—’
‘I don’t think any amount of support could have stopped him being shot. I think Kevin pieced together something about Daiyu’s drowning. The church would’ve been able to bully a publisher into deleting unsubstantiated allegations, but they’d lost the power to bully Kevin into silence in his daily life. What if he blabbed his suspicions to the wrong person?’
‘But, as you say, this is guesswork.’
‘Were you aware Patterson didn’t hand over all their evidence when you fired them?’
‘No,’ said Sir Colin. ‘I wasn’t.’
‘Well, I’ve got hold of a taped interview with Kevin they’d recorded covertly, five days before he was shot. It’s a botched job: most of what he said isn’t audible, which is why they didn’t bother giving it to you. In that tape, Kevin told Patterson’s operative he was intending to meet somebody from the church to “answer for it”. What “it” is, I don’t know, but he was talking a lot about Daiyu during the conversation. And you never visited Kevin’s bedsit, did you?’
‘No – I wish I had.’
‘Well, he’d scribbled all over the walls – and somebody had gouged a few words out of the plaster. It might’ve been Kevin himself, of course, but there’s a possibility his killer did it.
‘Robin got some strange information about Daiyu’s movements the night before she supposedly drowned, from Kevin’s sister Emily. What Emily said tallied with something Kevin had written on his bedsit wall, about a plot. As a matter of fact,’ said Strike, picking up his coffee cup, ‘Emily doesn’t believe Daiyu’s dead.’
‘But,’ said Sir Colin, still frowning, ‘that’s incredibly unlikely, surely?’
‘Unlikely,’ said Strike, ‘but not impossible. As it happens, alive or dead, Daiyu was worth a lot of money. She was the sole beneficiary of her biological father’s will, and he had a lot to leave. Where there’s no body, there’s got to be a doubt – which is why I want to talk to Cherie Gittins.’
‘With respect,’ said Sir Colin, with the polite but firm air Strike imagined he’d once brought to discussions of hare-brained political projects during his professional life, ‘I’m more hopeful that your partner’s leads will achieve my immediate aim – that of getting Will out of Chapman Farm – than that anyone can bring the entire religion down.’
‘But you don’t object to me interviewing Cherie Gittins?’
‘No,’ said Sir Colin slowly, ‘but I wouldn’t want this investigation to devolve into a probe into Daiyu Wace’s death. After all, it was ruled an accident, and you’ve no proof it wasn’t, have you?’
Strike, who couldn’t blame his client for this scepticism, reassured Sir Colin that the agency’s aim remained extracting his son from the UHC. The lunch concluded amicably, with Strike promising to pass on any new developments promptly, particularly as regarded the police investigation into the mistreatment of Jacob.
Nevertheless, it was the deaths of Daiyu Wace and Kevin Pirbright about which Strike was thinking as he set off back to Denmark Street. Sir Colin Edensor was correct in saying that Strike still had no concrete evidence to support his suspicions. It might indeed be overambitious to think that he’d be able to destroy the myth of the Drowned Prophet, which had survived uncontested for twenty-one years. But after all, thought the detective, still hungry after his meagre meal of fish, yet noticing how much more easily he was walking without the several stone he’d already shed, it was sometimes surprising what concerted effort in pursuit of a worthwhile goal could achieve.
