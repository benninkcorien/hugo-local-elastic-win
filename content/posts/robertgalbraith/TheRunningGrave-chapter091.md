The Running Grave
91
Nine in the fourth place means:
Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
While Strike was having coffee with Sir Colin Edensor, Robin was drinking a mug of tea at the table in her sitting room, her laptop and notebook open in front of her, hard at work and savouring the temporary peace. The man upstairs, whose music was usually audible, was at work, and she’d managed to get her parents out of the flat by asking them to do some food shopping.
Robin’s adjustment from life at Chapman Farm to her flat in London was proving far more difficult than she’d anticipated. She felt agitated, disorientated and overwhelmed, not only by her freedom, but also by her mother’s constant vigilance which, while kindly meant, was aggravating Robin, because it reminded her of the unrelenting surveillance she’d just escaped. She realised now, when it was too late, that what she’d really needed on returning to London was silence, space and solitude in which to reground herself in the outside world, and to concentrate on the long report for Strike in which she was tabulating everything she hadn’t yet told him about life at Chapman Farm. Guilt about her parents’ four months of anxiety on her behalf had made her agree to their visit but, much as she loved them, all she wanted now was their return to Yorkshire. Unfortunately, they were threatening to stay another week, ‘to keep you company’ and ‘to look after you’.
With a sinking heart, she now heard the lift doors out on the landing. As she got up to let her parents back in, the mobile on the table behind her started to ring.
‘Sorry,’ she said to her mother, who was laden with heavy Waitrose bags, ‘I need to get that, it might be Strike.’
‘You’re supposed to be taking time off!’ said Linda, a comment Robin ignored. Sure enough, on returning to her phone she saw her partner’s number, and answered.
‘Hi,’ said Robin, as Linda said, deliberately loudly,
‘Don’t be long, we’ve bought cakes. You should be eating and putting your feet up.’
‘Bad time?’ said Strike.
‘No,’ said Robin, ‘but could you give me two minutes? I’ll ring you back.’
She hung up and headed to the doorway of the cramped kitchen, where her parents were putting the shopping away.
‘I’m just going to nip out and get some fresh air,’ said Robin.
‘What aren’t we allowed to hear?’ said Linda.
‘Nothing, he’s just giving me an update I asked for,’ said Robin, keeping her tone light with some difficulty. ‘I’ll be back in ten minutes.’
She hurried out of the flat, keys in hand. Having reached Blackhorse Road, which offered exhaust fumes rather than clean air, she called Strike back.
‘Everything OK?’
‘It’s fine, I’m fine,’ said Robin feverishly. ‘My mother’s just driving me up the wall.’
‘Ah,’ said Strike.
‘I’ve told her about a hundred times it was my choice to go Chapman Farm, and my choice to stay in that long, but—’
Robin bit back the end of the sentence, but Strike knew perfectly well what she’d been about to say.
‘She thinks it’s all on me?’
‘Well,’ said Robin, who hadn’t wanted to say it, but was yearning to unburden herself, ‘yes. I’ve told her I had to argue you into letting me do the job, and that you wanted me to come out earlier, I’ve even told her she should be bloody grateful you were there when I ran for it, but she… God, she’s infuriating.’
‘You can’t blame her,’ said Strike reasonably, remembering how appalled he’d been at Robin’s appearance when he’d first seen her. ‘It’s your parents, of course they’re going to be worried. How much have you told them?’
‘That’s the joke! I haven’t told them a tenth of it! I had to say I didn’t get enough food, because that’s obvious, and they know I’m not sleeping very well –’ Robin wasn’t about to admit she’d woken herself up the previous evening by yelping loudly in her sleep ‘– but given what I could have said – and I think Ryan’s been winding them up, telling them how worried he was, all the time I was in there. He’s trying to get an earlier flight home from Spain, but honestly, the last thing I need is for him and my mother to get together… oh, and they’ve put up a huge poster of Jonathan Wace on the side of a building just up the road.’
‘Advertising his Super Service at Olympia? Yeah, it’s everywhere.’
‘I feel like I can’t get away from… sorry, I know I’m ranting,’ said Robin, exhaling as she leaned up against a convenient wall and watched the passing traffic. At least she couldn’t see Wace’s face from here. ‘Tell me about Colin Edensor. How did he take it all?’
‘About as well as could be expected,’ said Strike. ‘Full of praise for you and all the leads you got. He’s approved funds to try and find Lin and get Emily out, but he’s far less enthused by the idea of debunking Daiyu’s myth. Can’t say that was a surprise. I know full well it’s a long shot.’
‘The police still haven’t got back to me about Jacob.’
‘Well, getting warrants take time,’ said Strike, ‘although I’d have thought they’d have been in touch by now, given it’s a dying child.’
‘Well, exactly. Listen, Strike, I really think I could—’
‘You’re taking this week off,’ said Strike. ‘You need to catch up on sleep and get some food into you. A doctor would probably say it should be longer.’
‘Listen, you know how Jiang said he’d recognised someone who’d been at Chapman Farm a long time ago? Did I tell you that, I can’t remember?’
‘You did,’ said Strike, who considered it a bad sign that Robin’s conversation was jumping around so much, ‘yes.’
‘OK, so I’ve been trying to find out who that could be, and I think—’
‘Robin—’
‘—it must be either Marion Huxley or Walter Fernsby. Jiang made it sound like they’d just come back, and they were the only ones of the recent intake who’re old enough to have been there years ago. So I’ve been trying to trace—’
‘This can wait,’ said Strike loudly, talking over her. ‘This can all wait.’
‘For God’s sake, you sound like my mother! She keeps interrupting me when I’m trying to look things up, like I’m some – some geriatric convalescent.’
‘I don’t think you’re a geriatric convalescent,’ said Strike patiently, ‘I just think you need a break. If either Walter or Marion were there before, we can look into it when you’re—’
‘Don’t say “better”, I’m not ill. Strike, I want to get that bloody church, I want to find something on them, I want—’
‘I know what you want, and I want the same thing, but I don’t want my partner having a breakdown.’
‘I’m not—’
‘Get some rest, eat some food and calm the fuck down. Listen,’ he added, before she could respond. ‘I’m going to drive to Thornbury on Monday to try and interview Cherie Gittins – or Carrie Curtis Woods, as she is now. She’ll be back from her holidays, her husband should be at work, and I think she’ll be home with her kids, because there’s no indication of her having a job on her Facebook page. D’you fancy coming with me to interview her?’
‘Oh God, yes,’ said Robin fervently. ‘That’ll give me an excuse to get rid of my parents, telling them I’m going back to work. Much more of this will tip me over the edge. What are you up to for the rest of the day?’
‘On the Franks this evening,’ said Strike. ‘Everything’s in place for them to make their big move and they still haven’t bloody done it. Wish they’d hurry up.’
‘You want them to try and abduct Tasha Mayo?’
‘Honestly, yes. Then we can get the bastards arrested. Did I tell you one of them’s been done for stalking and the other one for flashing? And that they’re using a different surname to the one they used to have? A good reminder to all of us that oddballs aren’t necessarily harmless.’
‘I’ve been thinking about that constantly since I got out of Chapman Farm,’ said Robin. ‘Thinking about how the church has got so big, and how they’ve got away with it, all this time. People have just let them get on with it… a bit weird, but harmless…’
‘If you’d met my mother,’ said Strike, who was now waiting to cross Charing Cross Road, ‘you’d have seen the purest example of that mindset I’ve ever come across. It was a point of pride with her to like anyone who was a bit off. In fact, the more off, the better, which is how I ended up with Shanker as a stepbrother – speaking of whom, he rang me last night to say Jordan Reaney’s back in the nick, but they’re keeping him on suicide watch.’
‘Are you thinking of interviewing him again?’
‘Don’t think there’s any point. I think he’ll keep shtum even if Shanker’s mates beat the shit out of him again. That’s a very frightened man.’
‘Frightened of the Drowned Prophet?’ said Robin, to whom Strike had related the story of his encounter with Reaney on their drive back to London from Felbrigg Lodge.
‘There wasn’t a Drowned Prophet when Reaney was in the church, Daiyu was still alive for most of his time there. No, the more I think about it, the more I think what’s scaring Reaney is a gate arrest.’
‘Meaning…?’
‘That he’s done something he’s worried he could be nicked for the moment he leaves jail.’
‘But he can’t have had anything to do with Daiyu’s drowning. You told me he overslept.’
‘I know, but he could have done any number of dodgy things that had nothing to do with Daiyu. He might be worried he’ll be done for what was going on in those Polaroids.’
‘You think he was one of them?’
‘Dunno. He could be the guy with the skull tattoo. He’s got a devil on his upper arm now, which could be covering up an old marking. Skull Tattoo was sodomising a man we know had a low IQ and possibly brain damage, so Reaney might be scared he’s going to be done for rape.’
‘Oh God,’ said Robin quietly, ‘it’s terrible, all of it.’
‘Of course, if it was him, Reaney could argue in court he was forced to do it,’ said Strike. ‘If the church really has got guns, someone could’ve had one trained on those kids in the pig masks and forced them to perform. I can understand why Reaney wouldn’t want the episode publicised, though. Rapists and paedos are bottom of the food chain, even among hardened cons.
‘Anyway,’ said Strike, remembering a little late that he wasn’t supposed to be encouraging his partner to focus on violence and depravity, but encouraging her to keep her mind on pleasanter matters, ‘go and eat cake and watch a film with your mother or something. That should keep her happy.’
‘She’s probably hidden my laptop while I’ve been talking to you. I’ll let you know if the police get back to me about Jacob.’
‘Do,’ said Strike, ‘but in the meantime—’
‘Doughnuts and romcoms,’ sighed Robin. ‘Yes, all right.’
