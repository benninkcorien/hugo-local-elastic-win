The Running Grave
16
The line at the beginning has good fortune, the second is favourable; this is due to the time.
The third line bears an augury of misfortune, the fifth of illness…
The I Ching or Book of Changes
For the next couple of days, Strike and Robin communicated only by matter-of-fact texts, with neither jokes nor extraneous chat. Robin was more annoyed with herself for dwelling on the door slamming and the accusation that she’d been gossiping with Ilsa behind her partner’s back than she was at Strike for doing either of these two things.
Strike, who knew he’d behaved unreasonably, made no apology. However, a nagging sense of self-recrimination was added to his irritation at Ilsa, and both were intensified by his second date with Bijou.
He’d known he was making a mistake within five minutes of meeting her again. While she’d roared with laughter at her own anecdotes and talked loudly about top QCs who fancied her, he’d sat in near silence, asking himself what the hell he was playing at. Determined at least to get what he’d come for, he left her flat a few hours later with a faint feeling of self-disgust and a strong desire never to set eyes on her again. The only small consolation was that his hamstring hadn’t suffered this time, because he’d indicated a preference for being horizontal while having sex.
While it was hardly the first time Strike had slept with a woman he wasn’t in love with, never before had he screwed someone he actively disliked. The whole episode, which he now considered firmly closed, had intensified rather than alleviated his low mood, forcing him back up against his feelings for Robin.
Little did Strike know that Robin and Murphy’s relationship had suffered its first serious blow, a fact that Robin had no intention whatsoever of sharing with her business partner.
The row happened on Wednesday evening in a bar near Piccadilly Circus. Robin, who was due to leave for Coventry at five o’clock the following morning, hadn’t really fancied a mid-week trip to the cinema in the first place. However, as Murphy had already bought the tickets, she felt she couldn’t object. He seemed determined not to slide into a pattern whereby they merely met at each other’s flats for food and sex. Robin guessed this was due to a fear of taking her for granted or getting into a rut, which she’d deduced, from oblique comments, had been a complaint of his ex-wife’s.
The trigger for their argument was a casual remark of Robin’s about her planned stay at Chapman Farm. It then became clear that Murphy was labouring under a misapprehension. He’d thought she’d only be gone for seven days if she managed to be recruited, and was shocked to discover that, in reality, she’d committed to an open-ended undercover job that might last several weeks. Murphy was nettled that Robin hadn’t explained the situation fully, while Robin was irate at the fact he hadn’t listened properly. It might not be Murphy’s fault that he was bringing back unpleasant memories of her ex-husband’s assumed right to dictate the limits of her professional commitment, but the comparison was unavoidable, given that Murphy seemed to think Strike had pressured Robin into doing this onerous job, and she hadn’t been assertive enough to refuse.
‘I happen to want to do it,’ Robin told Murphy, speaking in an angry whisper, because the bar was crowded. The moment they should have left for the cinema had slid past twenty minutes previously, unnoticed. ‘I volunteered because I know I’m the best person for the job – and for your information, Strike’s been actively trying to persuade me out of it.’
‘Why?’
‘Because it might take so long,’ said Robin, lying by omission.
‘And he’s going to miss you, is that what you’re saying?’
‘You know what, Ryan? Sod off.’
Indifferent to the curious looks of a group of girls standing nearby, who’d been casting the handsome Murphy sidelong glances, Robin dragged her coat back on.
‘I’m going home. I’ve got to get up at the crack of dawn to drive to Coventry, anyway.’
‘Robin—’
But she was already striding towards the door.
Murphy caught up with her a hundred yards down the road. His apology, which was fulsome, was made within sight of the cupid-topped Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain where her ex-husband had proposed, which did nothing to dispel Robin’s sense of déjà vu. However, as Murphy gallantly took all the blame on himself, Robin felt she had no choice but to relent. Given that Hail, Caesar! was already half over, they went instead for a cheap Italian meal and parted, at least superficially, on good terms.
Nevertheless, Robin’s mood remained low as she set off north in her old Land Rover the following morning. Yet again, she’d been forced to face the difficulty of reconciling any kind of normal personal life with her chosen line of work. She’d thought it might be easier with Ryan, given his profession, but here she was again, justifying commitments she knew he wouldn’t have given a second thought to, had he been the one making them.
Her journey up the M1 was uneventful and therefore offered few distractions from her unsatisfactory musings. However, as she approached Newport Pagnell service station, where she’d been planning to stop for a coffee, Ilsa called. The Land Rover didn’t have Bluetooth, so Robin waited until she was in Starbucks before ringing Ilsa back.
‘Hi,’ she said, trying to sound more cheerful than she felt, ‘what’s up?’
‘Nothing, really,’ said Ilsa. ‘Just wondered whether Corm’s said anything to you.’
‘About Bijou?’ said Robin, who couldn’t be bothered to pretend she didn’t know what Ilsa was talking about. ‘Other than accusing me of talking to you behind his back, no.’
‘Oh God,’ groaned Ilsa. ‘I’m sorry. I was only trying to warn him—’
‘I know,’ sighed Robin, ‘but you know what he’s like.’
‘Nick says I should apologise, which is nice bloody solidarity from my husband, I must say. I’d like to see Nick’s face if Bijou gets herself knocked up on purpose. I don’t s’pose you know—?’
‘Ilsa,’ said Robin, cutting across her friend, ‘if you’re about to ask me whether I quiz Strike on his contraceptive habits—’
‘You realise she told me – with five other people within earshot, incidentally – that she took a used condom out of the bin, while she was having an affair with that married QC, and inserted it inside herself?’
‘Jesus,’ said Robin, startled, and very much wishing she hadn’t been given this information, ‘well, I – I suppose that’s Strike’s lookout, isn’t it?’
‘I was trying to be a good friend,’ said Ilsa, sounding frustrated. ‘However much of a dickhead he is, I don’t want him paying child support to bloody Bijou Watkins for the next eighteen years. She’d make a nightmarish mother, nearly as bad as Charlotte Campbell.’
By the time Robin got back in the Land Rover, she felt more miserable than ever, and it took a considerable effort of will to refocus her attention on the job in hand.
She arrived in Sheila Kennett’s road at five minutes to twelve. As she locked up the Land Rover, Robin wondered how, given what Kevin Pirbright had said about church members sinking all of their money into the UHC, Sheila had managed to afford even this small bungalow, shabby though it looked.
When she rang the doorbell she heard footsteps of a speed that surprised her, given that Sheila Kennett was eighty-five years old.
The door opened to reveal a tiny old woman whose thinning grey hair was worn in a bun. Her dark eyes, of which both irises showed marked arcus senilis, were enormously enlarged by a pair of powerful bifocals. Slightly stooped, Sheila wore a loose red dress, navy carpet slippers, an oversize hearing aid, a tarnished gold wedding ring and a silver cross around her neck.
‘Hello,’ said Robin, smiling down at her. ‘We spoke on the phone. I’m Robin Ellacott, the—’
‘Private detective, are you?’ said Sheila, in her slightly cracked voice.
‘Yes,’ said Robin, holding out her driving licence. ‘This is me.’
Sheila blinked at the licence for a few seconds, then said,
‘That’s all right. Come in, then,’ and moved aside for Robin to pass into the hall, which was carpeted in dark brown. The bungalow smelled slightly fusty.
‘You go in there,’ said Sheila, pointing Robin into the front room. ‘Want tea?’
‘Thank you – can I help?’ asked Robin, as she watched the fragile-looking Sheila shuffling away towards the kitchen. Sheila made no answer. Robin hoped the hearing aid was turned up.
The peeling wallpaper and the sparse, shabby furniture spoke of poverty. A green sofa sat at right angles to a faded tartan chair with a matching footstool. The television was old, and beneath it sat an equally antiquated video player, while a rickety bookcase held a mixture of large-print novels. The only photograph in the room stood on top of the bookcase, and showed a 1960s wedding. Sheila and her husband, Brian, whose name Robin knew from the census reports, were pictured standing outside a registry office. Sheila, who’d been very pretty in her youth, wore her dark hair in a beehive, her full-skirted wedding dress falling to just beneath her knees. The picture was made touching by the fact that the slightly goofy-looking Brian was beaming, as though he couldn’t believe his luck.
Something brushed Robin’s ankle: a grey cat had just entered the room and was now staring up at her with its clear green eyes. As Robin bent to tickle it behind the ears, a tinkling sound announced the reappearance of Sheila, who was holding an old tin tray on which were two mugs, a jug and a plate of what Robin recognised as Mr Kipling’s Bakewell slices.
‘Let me,’ said Robin, as some of the hot liquid had already spilled. Sheila let Robin lift the tray out of her hands and set it on the small coffee table. Sheila took her own mug, placed it on the arm of the tartan armchair, sat down, put her tiny feet on the stool, then said, peering at the tea tray,
‘I forgot the sugar. I’ll go—’
She began to struggle out of the chair again.
‘That’s fine, I don’t take it,’ said Robin hastily. ‘Unless you do?’
Sheila shook her head and relaxed back into her chair. When Robin sat down on the sofa, the cat leapt up beside her and rubbed itself against her, purring.
‘He’s not mine,’ said Sheila, watching the cat’s antics. ‘He’s next door’s, but he likes it here.’
‘Clearly,’ said Robin, smiling, as she ran her hand over the cat’s arched back. ‘What’s his name?’
‘Smoky,’ said Sheila, raising her mug to her mouth. ‘He likes it here,’ she repeated.
‘Would you mind if I take notes?’ asked Robin.
‘Write things down? That’s all right,’ said Sheila Kennett. While Robin took out her pen, Sheila made a kissing sound in the direction of Smoky the cat, but he ignored her, and continued to rub his head against Robin. ‘Ungrateful,’ said Sheila. ‘I gave him tinned salmon last night.’
Robin smiled again before opening her notebook.
‘So, Mrs Kennett—’
‘You can call me Sheila. Why’ve you done that to your hair?’
‘Oh – this?’ said Robin self-consciously, raising a hand to the blue edges of her bob. ‘I’m just trying it out.’
‘Punk rock, is it?’ said Sheila.
Deciding against telling Sheila she was approximately forty years out of date, Robin said,
‘A bit.’
‘You’re a pretty girl. You don’t want blue hair.’
‘I’m thinking of changing it back,’ said Robin. ‘So… could I ask when did you and your husband go to live at Chapman Farm?’
‘Wasn’t called Chapman Farm then,’ said the old lady. ‘It was Forgeman Farm. Brian and me were hippies,’ said Sheila, blinking at Robin through the thick lenses of her glasses. ‘You know what hippies are?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘Well, that’s what me and Brian was. Hippies,’ said Sheila. ‘Living on a commune. Hippies,’ she said yet again, as though she liked the sound of the word.
‘Can you remember when—?’
‘Sixty-nine we went there,’ said Sheila. ‘When it was all starting. We grew pot. Know what pot is?’
‘I do, yes,’ said Robin.
‘We used to smoke a lot of that,’ said Sheila, with another little cackle.
‘Who else was there at the beginning, can you remember?’
‘Yes, I can remember all that,’ said Sheila proudly. ‘Rust Andersen. American, he was. Living in a tent up the fields. Harold Coates. I remember all that. Can’t remember yesterday sometimes, but I remember all that. Coates was a nasty man. Very nasty man.’
‘Why d’you say that?’
‘Kids,’ said Sheila. ‘Don’t you know about all that?’
‘Are you talking about when the Crowther brothers were arrested?’
‘That’s them. Nasty people. Horrible people. Them and their friends.’
The cat’s purrs filled the room as it lolled on its back, Robin stroking it with her left hand.
‘Brian and me never knew what they were up to,’ said Sheila. ‘We never knew what was going on. We were busy growing and selling veg. Brian had pigs.’
‘Did he?’
‘He loved his pigs, and his chickens. Kids running around everywhere… I couldn’t have none of my own. Miscarriages. I had nine, all told.’
‘Oh, I’m so sorry,’ said Robin.
‘Never had none of our own,’ repeated Sheila. ‘We wanted kids, but we couldn’t. There was loads of kids running around at the farm, and I remember your friend. Big lad. Bigger than some of the older boys.’
‘Sorry?’ said Robin, flummoxed.
‘Your partner. Condoman Strike or something, isn’t it?’
‘That’s right,’ said Robin, looking at her curiously, and wondering whether the old lady, who might repeat herself a lot, but had seemed basically alert, was in fact senile.
‘When I told Next Door you was coming to see me, she read me out an article about you and him. He was there, with his sister and his mum. I remember, because my Brian fancied Leda Strike and I could tell, and we had rows about it. Jealous. I’d see him watching her all the time. Jealous,’ Sheila repeated. ‘I don’t think Leda would’ve looked at my Brian, though. He was no rock star, Brian.’
Sheila gave another cracked laugh. Doing her best to dissemble her shock, Robin said,
‘Your memory’s very good, Sheila.’
‘Oh, I remember all what happened on the farm. Don’t remember yesterday sometimes, but I remember all that. I helped little Ann give birth. Harold Coates was there. He was a doctor. I helped. She had a rough old time. Well… she was only fourteen.’
‘Really?’
‘Yeah… free love, see. It wasn’t like it is now. It was different.’
‘Was the baby—?’
‘It was all right. Mazu, Ann called her, but Ann took off, not long after. Left her at the commune. Didn’t like being a mother. Too young.’
‘So who looked after Mazu?’ asked Robin, ‘Her father?’
‘Don’t know who her father was. I never knew who Ann was going with. People were sleeping with whoever. Not me and Brian, though. We were trying to have our own kids. Busy on the farm. We didn’t know everything that was going on,’ said Sheila, yet again. ‘Police come into the farm, no warning. Somebody tipped them off. We was all questioned. My Brian was at the station for hours. They searched all the rooms. Went through all our personal things. Me and Brian left after that.’
‘Did you?’
‘Yeah. Awful,’ said Sheila, and yet again, she emphasised, ‘We didn’t know. We never knew. It’s not like they were doing it in the yard. We were busy with the farming.’
‘Where did you go, when you left?’
‘Here,’ said Sheila, indicating the bungalow with her mottled hand. ‘This was my mum and dad’s place. Ooh, they were angry about all the things in the papers. And Brian couldn’t get a job. I got one. Office clerk. I didn’t like it. Brian missed the farm.’
‘How long were you away, Sheila, can you remember?’
‘Two years… three years… then Mazu wrote to us. She said it was all better and they had a good new community. Brian was good at the farming, see, that’s why she wanted him… so we went back.’
‘Can you remember who was there, when you returned?’
‘Don’t you want a cake?’
‘Thank you, I’d love one,’ lied Robin, reaching for a Bakewell slice. ‘Can I—?’
‘No, I got them for you,’ said Sheila. ‘What did you just ask me?’
‘About who was at Chapman Farm, when you went back there to live.’
‘I don’t know all the names. There was a couple of new families. Coates was still there. What did you ask me?’
‘Just about the people,’ said Robin, ‘who were there when you went back.’
‘Oh… Rust Andersen was still in his cabin. And the Graves boy – posh, skinny boy. He was new. He’d go up Rust’s place and smoke half the night. Pot. D’you know what pot is?’ she asked, again.
‘I do, yes,’ said Robin, smiling.
‘It doesn’t do some people any good,’ said Sheila wisely. ‘The Graves boy couldn’t handle it. He went funny. Some people shouldn’t smoke it.’
‘Was Jonathan Wace at the farm, when you went back?’ asked Robin.
‘That’s right, with his little girl, Abigail. And Mazu had a baby: Daiyu.’
‘What did you think of Jonathan Wace?’ asked Robin.
‘Charming. That’s what I thought, then. He took us all in. Charming,’ she repeated.
‘What made him come and live at the farm, d’you know?’
‘No, I don’t know why he came. I felt sorry for Abigail. Her mum died, then her dad brought her to the farm, and next minute she’s got a sister…’
‘And when did the whole idea of a church start up, can you remember?’
‘That was because Jonathan used to give us talks about his beliefs. He had us meditating and he started making us go out on the street and collect money. People would come and listen to him talk.’
‘Lots more people started coming to the farm, did they?’
‘Yeah, and they were paying. Some of them were posh. Then Jonathan started going on trips, giving his talks. He left Mazu in charge. She’d grown her hair down to her waist – long black hair – and she was telling everyone she was half-Chinese, but she was never Chinese,’ said Sheila scathingly. ‘Her mum was as white as you and me. There was no Chinese man, ever, at Chapman Farm. We never told her we knew she was lying, though. We were just happy to be back at the farm, me and Brian. What did you ask me?’
‘Just about the church, and how it began.’
‘Oh… Jonathan was running courses, with his meditation and all his Eastern religions and things, and then he started taking services, so we built a temple at the farm.’
‘And were you happy?’ asked Robin.
Sheila blinked a few times before saying,
‘It was happy sometimes. Sometimes it was. But bad things happened. Rust got hit by a car one night. Jonathan said it was a judgement, for all the lives Rust took in the war… and then the Graves boy’s family came and grabbed him off the street, when he was out in Norwich, and we heard he’d hanged himself. Jonathan told us that’s what would happen to all of us, if we left. He said Alex had got a glimpse of truth, but he couldn’t cope with the world outside. So that was a warning for us, Jonathan said.’
‘Did you believe him?’ asked Robin.
‘I did then,’ said Sheila. ‘I believed everything Jonathan said, back then. So did Brian. Jonathan had a way of making you believe… a way of making you want to make everything all right, for him. You wanted to look after him.’
‘To look after Jonathan?’
‘Yeah… you should’ve seen him crying, when Rust and Alex died. He seemed to feel it worse than all the rest of us.’
‘You said it was happy at the farm sometimes. Were there other times when—?’
‘Nasty things started happening,’ said the old lady. Her lips had started to tremble. ‘It was Mazu, not Jonathan… it wasn’t Jonathan. It was her.’
‘What kind of nasty things?’ asked Robin, her pen poised over her notebook.
‘Just… punishments,’ said Sheila, her lips still trembling. After a few seconds’ silence, she said,
‘Paul let the pigs out, by accident and Mazu made people hit him.’
‘Can you remember Paul’s surname?’
‘Draper,’ said Sheila, after a slight pause. ‘Everyone called him Dopey. He wasn’t normal. Bit retarded. They shouldn’t have had him looking after the pigs. He left the gate open. Dopey Draper.’
‘Do you know where he is now?’
Sheila shook her head.
‘Do you remember a boy called Jordan whipping himself?’
‘There was lots of times people was whipped. Yeah, I remember Jordan. Teenager.’
‘Would you happen to remember his surname, Sheila?’
Sheila thought a little, then said,
‘Reaney. Jordan Reaney. He was a rough sort. Been in trouble with the police.’
As Robin made a note of Jordan’s surname, the cat beside her, bored of inattention, leapt lightly off the sofa and stalked out of the room.
‘Everything got worse after Daiyu died,’ said Sheila, unprompted. ‘You know who Daiyu was?’
‘Jonathan and Mazu’s daughter,’ said Robin. ‘She drowned, didn’t she?’
‘That’s right. Cherie took her to the beach.’
‘This is Cherie Gittins?’ asked Robin.
‘That’s right. Silly girl, she was. Daiyu bossed her around.’
‘Would you happen to know what happened to Cherie after Daiyu died, Sheila?’
‘Punished,’ said Sheila. She now looked very distressed. ‘All them who were involved were punished.’
‘What d’you mean, “all of them”, Sheila?’
‘Cherie, and the ones who didn’t stop it. The ones who saw them leaving in the truck that morning – but they didn’t know! They thought Daiyu had permission! My Brian, and Dopey Draper, and little Abigail. They was all punished.’
‘Hit?’ asked Robin tentatively.
‘No,’ said Sheila, suddenly agitated. ‘Worse. It was wicked.’
‘What—?’
‘Never you mind,’ said Sheila, her small hands balled into shaking fists. ‘Least said about that… but they knew Brian was ill when they did it to him. He kept losing his balance. Jonathan had been telling him to go and pray in temple, and then he’d be better. But after they punished him, he was much worse. He couldn’t see properly, and they still made him get up and go collecting on the street… and in the end,’ said Sheila, her agitation increasing, ‘Brian was screaming and moaning. He couldn’t get out of bed. They carried him into the temple. He died on the temple floor. I was with him. He’d been quiet for a whole day, and then he died. All stiff on the temple floor. I woke up next to him and I knew he was dead. His eyes were open…’
The old lady began to weep. Robin, who felt desperately sorry for her, glanced around the room for a sign of a tissue.
‘Tumour,’ sobbed Sheila. ‘That’s what he had. They opened him up to find out what it was. Tumour.’
She wiped her nose on the back of her hand.
‘Let me…’ said Robin, getting up and leaving the room. In the small bathroom off the hall, which had an old pink sink and bath, she pulled off a length of toilet roll and hurried back to the sitting room to give it to Sheila.
‘Thanks,’ said Sheila, wiping her eyes and blowing her nose as Robin sat back down on the sofa.
‘Is that when you left for good, Sheila?’ Robin asked. ‘After Brian died?’
Sheila nodded, tears still trickling out from behind the bifocals.
‘And they threatened me, trying to stop me going. They said I was a bad person and they’d tell everyone I’d been cruel to Brian, and they said they knew I’d taken money, and they’d seen me hurting the animals on the farm… I never hurt an animal, I never did…
‘Wicked,’ she said, with a sob. ‘Wicked, they are. I thought he was so good, Jonathan. He said to me, “Brian was nearly better, Sheila, but he wasn’t pure spirit yet, and that’s why he died. You stopped him being pure spirit, shouting at him and not being a good wife.” He wasn’t nearly better,’ said Sheila, with another sob. ‘He wasn’t. He couldn’t see properly and he couldn’t walk right, and they did terrible things to him and then they were yelling at him because he hadn’t collected enough money on the street.’
‘I’m so sorry, Sheila,’ said Robin quietly. ‘I really am. I’m so sorry.’
A loud mew pierced the silence. Smoky the cat had reappeared.
‘He’s after food,’ said Sheila tearfully. ‘It isn’t time,’ she told the cat. ‘You’ll have me in trouble with Next Door if I start giving you lunch.’
Sheila seemed exhausted. Robin, who didn’t want to leave her in this state, turned the conversation gently to cats and their vagrant habits. After ten minutes or so, Sheila had regained her composure sufficiently to talk about her own cat, who’d been run over in the street outside, but Robin could tell her distress still lay close to the surface and felt it would be cruel to press for further reminiscences.
‘Thank you so much for talking to me, Sheila,’ she said at last. ‘Just one last question, if you don’t mind. Do you know when Cherie Gittins left Chapman Farm? Would you have any idea where she is now?’
‘She left not long after Brian died. I don’t know where she went. It was her fault it all happened!’ she said, with a resurgence of anger. ‘It was all her fault!’
‘Is there anything I can do for you, before I go?’ asked Robin, returning her notebook to her bag. ‘Maybe call your neighbour? It might be good to have some company.’
‘Are you going to stop them?’ asked Sheila tearfully, ignoring Robin’s suggestion.
‘We’re going to try,’ said Robin.
‘You need to stop them,’ said Sheila fiercely. ‘We were hippies, Brian and me, that’s all. Hippies. We never knew what it was all going to turn into.’
