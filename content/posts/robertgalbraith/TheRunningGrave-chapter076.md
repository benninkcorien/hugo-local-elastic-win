The Running Grave
76
Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger.
Escape is out of the question.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
The Manifestation of the Drowned Prophet was now imminent, and Robin was instructed to join the group decorating the outside of the temple with long white banners on which stylised, dark blue waves had been printed. This entailed climbing high ladders, and while struggling to affix one of the banners to just beneath the temple roof, Robin thought how easy it would be for somebody below to kick the ladder out from under her: a tragic accident, they’d doubtless call it. However, no such attempt on her life was made, and she returned safely to the ground, castigating herself for her paranoia.
‘Looks cool, doesn’t it?’ said one of the good-looking American youths Wace had brought back from LA, who’d also helped decorate the temple. The banners were fluttering in the breeze, so that the printed waves seemed to be falling down its sides.
‘Yes, it looks great,’ said Robin. ‘D’you know when the Manifestation is?’
She was dreading Daiyu’s reappearance in the temple almost as much as she feared the possibility of being summoned back into the farmhouse to see Jonathan Wace.
‘Week’s time,’ said the American. ‘Man, I can’t wait. I’ve heard so much about it. You guys are blessed, living here, where the church started.’
He looked down at Robin, smiling.
‘Hey, wanna spirit bond?’
‘She can’t.’
It was Shawna who’d spoken. She, too, had been helping decorate the temple, cheerily climbing ladders even though her pregnancy had now given her a definite bump.
‘Huh?’ said the American.
‘Spirit wife,’ said Shawna, smiling broadly before walking away to help Walter, who was struggling to collapse one of the ladders.
‘Oh, man, I didn’t realise,’ the American told Robin, looking scared.
‘It’s fine,’ said Robin, but the young man escaped swiftly from her presence, as though now frightened to be seen talking to her.
Robin was confused and alarmed by what Shawna had said. Surely women didn’t become spirit wives just because Jonathan Wace had sexually assaulted them? She assisted in the carrying of the ladders back to a barn, consumed by fresh fears.
Over the next few days, Robin sensed an undercurrent of gossip swirling around her. It was in the sidelong glances of the women and even some of the men, and especially in the antagonistic looks of Vivienne. Since Shawna had announced it outside the temple, the rumour that Robin was Papa J’s new spirit wife had evidently travelled widely.
As nobody, even the people making sure she went nowhere unaccompanied, had posed a direct question, Robin was in no position to contradict the report; indeed, she wasn’t entirely sure of the facts herself. Perhaps Wace’s mere laying-on of hands was sufficient to create a spirit wife? However, if, as Robin suspected, Shawna had leapt to a false conclusion, Robin was afraid she might be accused of starting the canard herself. In fact, she had a nasty feeling this unsought dilemma might be the thing to finally break her cover, that the little eruption of envy caused by Shawna would lead all who had suspicion of her to pool their knowledge. Robin found herself constantly fantasising about making a break for it and running for the woods, even though there was no doubt an aborted escape attempt would make her situation far worse. The sensible thing to do, she knew, was leave via the perimeter blind spot on Thursday night, when somebody from the agency would be in the vicinity to pick her up. As long as she left then, she’d miss the Manifestation of the Drowned Prophet, which she’d now learned would take place on Friday evening. It was an experience Robin was perfectly happy to forgo, after what had happened during her Revelation session.
Taio had returned to the farm, without Lin. Robin, who’d seen him only from a distance, studiously avoided eye contact. All her efforts now were concentrated on securing a one-to-one conversation with Will Edensor. Finding out how deep his doubts about the church ran would justify everything she’d been through, and she’d leave knowing she’d truly made an advance in the case.
On Tuesday afternoon, Robin was sent to work in the laundry, a utilitarian, concrete-floored building of brick, housing rows of industrial-sized washing machines and drying racks on pulleys, which could be hoisted up to the ceiling. The women who’d escorted Robin to the door left after seeing her inside, clearly feeling there were enough people loading and unloading clothes and sheets to keep an eye on her.
The steady chug and hum of the washing machines necessitated the raising of voices if the workers wanted to make themselves heard. Having received a sack of dirty clothing and instructions as to the correct machine settings, Robin rounded a corner into the second row of washing machines and with a jolt of excitement saw Will kneeling in front of one of them, dragging a mound of wet clothing into a basket. Beside him, entering settings on a second machine, was Marion Huxley, who’d been so obviously infatuated with Jonathan Wace when she’d arrived at the farm, and with whom Robin hadn’t interacted in weeks.
The punishing work regime and commensurate weight loss had had an extremely ageing effect on Marion, whose gaunt face now sagged as it certainly hadn’t when she’d boarded the minibus in London. Her dyed red hair had now grown out to show two inches of silver roots.
Neither Will nor Marion heard Robin’s approach, and only when she’d chosen the washing machine next to Will’s did he glance up at her.
‘Hi,’ said Robin.
‘Hi,’ mumbled Will.
Having unloaded the tangled mass of wet clothes, he picked up the heavy basket and walked away.
Robin began to load her own washing machine. The surrounding noise was such that only when a voice said loudly in her ear, ‘Oi!’ did she realise Marion had been trying to speak to her.
‘Hi,’ said Robin, smiling before she registered that Marion looked livid.
‘I don’t know how you’ve got the gall to be walking around, smirking!’
‘Sorry?’ said Robin, taken aback.
‘You should be! Lying about Papa J.’
‘I haven’t said a word about—’
‘You claimed he spirit bonded with you.’
‘No, I—’
‘And we all know you’re lying. You’re no spirit wife!’
‘I never said—’
‘And you know what?’ said Marion. ‘The Drowned Prophet will sort you out.’
‘I don’t know what you—’
‘She’s been seen, already,’ said Marion. ‘In the woods. She comes, around her Manifestation time. She comes to defend Papa J.’
Robin knew she was looking into the authentic face of fanaticism. Something rigid and alien lived beneath the skin of the human being facing her, something that couldn’t be argued with. Nevertheless, she heard herself say pleadingly ‘Marion’, without any idea of what she was going to tell the woman, but before she could find any words, Marion had spat in her face.
Robin felt the saliva hit her, just beneath her left eye, and something broke inside her, some last vestige of restraint. They’re all mad. They’re fucking mad. Robin pushed Marion roughly aside and strode away, to where Will Edensor was draping wet tracksuits and socks onto a drying rack.
‘Will,’ she said loudly, over the noise of the machines. ‘D’you want to spirit bond?’
‘What?’
‘Do you want to spirit bond?’ Robin repeated, enunciating clearly.
‘Oh,’ said Will. He looked as though she’d just offered him coffee: he showed little interest, but no embarrassment or surprise, and she wondered how many times he’d been to the Retreat Rooms in the last four years. ‘Yeah, OK.’
They walked together towards the door, Robin consumed with rage at Marion, at the church, at the hypocrisy and insanity. She couldn’t pretend any more. She was done with all of it.
‘Where—?’ said an older woman near the door, looking suspicious.
‘Spirit bonding,’ said Robin firmly.
‘Oh,’ said the woman. She looked confused and panicked, probably because she didn’t know what should take priority: Robin being kept under surveillance, or an act of submission and compliance that appeared to demonstrate true allegiance to the UHC. ‘I – all right…’
Robin and Will walked together down the path towards the courtyard in silence, Robin trying to formulate a plan of action. The warning ripples of anxiety barely registered in her rage and determination to force something useful out of Will in her final hours at the farm.
When they reached the Retreat Room, Robin pulled open the glass door and stood back to let Will walk inside first. She then jerked the curtain across the glass windows, so that the only light came from the single light bulb dangling from the ceiling.
In silence, Will sat down on the bed to remove his socks and trainers.
‘Will,’ said Robin, ‘there’s no need for that, I really just wanted to talk to you.’
He glanced up at her.
‘That’s not allowed. We spirit bond, or we leave.’
He stood up and peeled off his tracksuit top to reveal a pale, hairless torso, every rib visible in the harsh overhead light. As he turned to throw his clothes into a corner, Robin saw on his back the same strange marks she’d noted on the black girl who’d let Bo escape from the children’s dormitory, as though his spine had been rubbed raw.
‘What’s happened to you?’ she asked. ‘What are those marks on your back?’
‘I was in the box,’ muttered Will.
‘Why?’
Will ignored the question, instead pulling off his greying Y-fronts and tracksuit bottoms. Now he stood completely naked in front of her, his penis flaccid.
‘Will, I just wanted to—’
‘Get undressed,’ said Will, walking to the corner of the cabin, where the short length of hose pipe was attached to the tap. Picking the slimy soap off the floor, he began to wash his genitalia.
‘That thing you said to Noli, in the kitchen,’ said Robin, raising her voice over the splattering of water on the wooden floor, ‘it made me th—’
‘Forget that!’ said Will, looking over his shoulder at her. ‘That’s why I had to go in the box. I shouldn’t have said it. If you’re going to talk about that, I’m leaving,’
He towelled himself off with a mouldy-looking towel, sat back down on the grubby bed and began to masturbate in an effort to achieve an erection.
‘Will, stop,’ said Robin, looking away from him. ‘Please stop.’
He did so, but not because of Robin. Something that sounded like a lawnmower had roared into life just outside the cabin. Robin crossed to the gap in the curtains and saw Amandeep mowing out there, an expression of grim determination on his face.
‘Who is it?’ said Will, from behind her.
‘Amandeep,’ said Robin. ‘Mowing the grass.’
‘That’s because you’re on a Mark Three,’ said Will. ‘He’s making sure you stay in here. Get undressed.’ He’d recommenced masturbating. ‘Take your clothes off, we’re supposed to be done in twenty minutes.’
‘Please stop doing that,’ Robin implored him. ‘Please. I just wanted to talk to you.’
‘Get undressed,’ he repeated, his hand still working furiously.
‘Will, that thing you said—’
‘Forget what I said,’ he retorted angrily, still struggling to achieve an erection. ‘It was false self, I didn’t mean it!’
‘Why did you say it at all, then?’
‘I was… I don’t like Seymour, that’s all. She shouldn’t be a Principal. She’s a BP. She doesn’t understand doctrine.’
‘But what you said makes sense,’ said Robin, ‘there is a contradiction between—’
‘“Human knowledge is finite,”’ said Will, ‘“divine truth is infinite.” The Answer, chapter eleven.’
‘D’you believe everything the church says? All of it?’ asked Robin, forcing herself to turn and face him, his semi-erect penis in his hand.
‘“Persistent refusal to merge the self with the collective reveals ongoing egomotivity.” The Answer, chapter five.’
The motor of the lawnmower continued to roar right beside the glass doors.
‘For God’s sake,’ said Robin, trapped between Amandeep and the masturbating Will, ‘you’re really intelligent, why are you afraid of thinking, why d’you just keep quoting?’
‘“Materialist thought patterns are entrenched at a young age. Breaking those patterns requires, in the first instance, the focusing of the mind on essential truths through repetition and meditation.” The Answer, chap—’
‘So you’ve voluntarily brainwashed yourself?’
‘Get undressed!’
Will stood up, towering over her, his hand still working to maintain his erection. ‘It’s a sin to come in here for anything other than spirit bonding!’
‘If you force me to have sex with you,’ said Robin in a low voice, ‘it’ll be rape, and how will the UHC like being hit with a lawsuit?’
The lawnmower outside banged against the far wall of the cabin. Will’s hand stopped moving. He stood in front of her, painfully thin, still holding his penis.
‘Where have they taken Lin?’ Robin asked, determined to break through to him.
‘Somewhere safe,’ he said, before adding angrily, ‘but that’s nothing to do with you.’
‘So I’m to merge myself with the collective by not thinking, and having sex with anyone who wants it, but I’m not allowed to be worried about a fellow church member, is that what you’re saying?’
‘You need to shut up,’ said Will furiously, ‘because I know things about you. You were in the woods at night, with a torch.’
‘No, I wasn’t,’ said Robin automatically.
‘Yeah, you were. I didn’t say anything, to protect Lin, but it can’t hurt her now.’
‘Why did you want to protect Lin? That’s materialist possession, caring about one person more than everyone else. Is it because she’s the mother of your child? Because Qing belongs to everyone in the church, not just—’
‘Shut up,’ said Will, and he raised his hand threateningly. ‘Shut the fuck up.’
‘No quotations for any of that?’ asked Robin, still angrier than she was scared. ‘You haven’t told anyone I had a torch in all the days since Lin’s been gone. Why didn’t you report me?’
‘Because they’ll say I should have done it sooner!’
‘Or did you secretly like thinking someone was wandering around with a torch at night?’
‘Why would I?’
‘You could have refused to come with me to the Retreat R—’
‘No, I couldn’t, you’ve got to go when you’re asked—’
‘I think you’re having doubts about the church.’
Will’s eyes narrowed. He let go of his penis and backed away several steps.
‘Did my father send you here?’
‘Why would you think that?’
‘He’s done it before. He sent a man to spy on me.’
‘I’m not a spy.’
Will snatched his pants and tracksuit bottoms off the floor and began to pull them on. Certain he was going to walk out and immediately reveal the conversation, Robin, now planning to make a break for the woods the moment she left the cabin, said,
‘What if I told you your family sent me?’
Will was now jumping on the spot as he pulled up his tracksuit bottoms.
‘I’m going to Papa J, right now,’ he said furiously. ‘I’m going to tell him—’
‘Will, your family loves you—’
‘They hate me,’ he spat at her. ‘Especially my father.’
‘That isn’t true!’
Will bent to grab his sweatshirt, his face suffused with angry colour.
‘My moth—Sally loves me. He doesn’t. He writes me lies, trying to force me to abandon the church.’
‘What lies does he write you?’
‘He pretended Mu—Sally was ill. I didn’t care, particularly,’ Will added savagely, pulling his top back on. ‘She’s no more to me now than you are. I’m not her flesh object. Anyway, she always sticks up for my—for Colin. But M—Sally wasn’t ill. She’s fine.’
‘How do you know that?’ said Robin.
‘I just know.’
‘Will,’ said Robin, ‘your mother’s dead. She died in January.’
Will froze. Outside, the lawnmower whined as Amandeep cut the power. Evidently he was counting down their twenty minutes. After what felt like a very long pause, Will said quietly,
‘You’re lying.’
‘I really wish I was,’ whispered Robin, ‘but I’m n—’
A rush of wild movement, the thump of bare feet of wood: Robin flung up her arms too late, and Will’s punch hit her squarely on the side of her face and with a scream of pain and shock she fell sideways, hitting the wall before landing hard on the floor.
Through a haze of pain she heard the glass door slide open and the curtains being tugged back.
‘What happened?’ said Amandeep.
Will said something Robin didn’t catch through the ringing in her ears. Her panic was nothing compared to the sharp, pulsing pain in her jaw, which was such that she wondered if it was fractured.
Hands hoisted her roughly up onto the bed.
‘… tripped?’
‘Yeah, and hit her face on the wall. Didn’t you?’ Will barked at Robin.
‘Yes,’ she said, unable to tell whether she was speaking too loudly. Black spots were popping in front of her eyes.
‘Had you finished?’ asked Amandeep.
‘Yeah, of course. Why d’you think she’s dressed?’
‘Where were you both, before bonding?’
‘Laundry,’ said Will.
‘I’ll go back now,’ said Robin.
She got shakily to her feet, careful not to look at Will. She’d run for it the second she could: off to the five-bar gate and across the field to the perimeter.
‘I’ll take you both back to the laundry,’ said Amandeep.
Robin’s head was swimming with pain and panic. She massaged her jaw, which she could feel swelling rapidly.
‘We can go on our own,’ she said.
‘No,’ said Amandeep, taking a firm hold of Robin’s wrist. ‘You’ve both been judged to need more spiritual support.’
