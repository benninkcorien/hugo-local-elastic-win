The Running Grave
70
Thus the superior man pardons mistakes
And forgives misdeeds.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Strike was having an extremely trying day.
At shortly after ten, as he was following Toy Boy and the client’s mother into Selfridges, Shanker called. Hoping for confirmation that Littlejohn was working undercover for Patterson Inc, Strike answered quickly, placing a finger in his free ear to block out the sound of canned music and talkative shoppers.
‘Hi,’ said Strike, ‘what’ve you got?’
‘Reaney’s tried to top ’imself. Fort you’d wanna know.’
‘He’s what?’
‘Yeah,’ said Shanker. ‘Overdose. Me mate in Bedford jus’ called an’ told me.’
‘When was this?’
‘Few days back. Silly cunt. Bought up and nicked all the pills ’e could get ’is ’ands on and took the lot.’
‘Shit. He’s still alive, though?’
‘Just abaht. In ’ospital. Me mate said ’e was yellow an’ covered in puke when the screws found ’im.’
‘Anyone know why he did it?’
‘Yeah, ’e got a phone call from ’is wife, a week ago. After that ’e started buying up everyfing anyone could give ’im and dahned the lot.’
‘OK,’ said Strike. ‘Cheers for letting me know.’
‘No bovver. Lot of it goin’ abaht, in’t there?’
‘What? Oh,’ said Strike, realising Shanker was talking about Charlotte. ‘Yeah, I s’pose. Listen, can you give those boys of yours a kick up the arse? I need something on Littlejohn, fast.’
Strike hung up and set off in pursuit of Toy Boy and his companion, thinking of Reaney as he’d last seem him, shoving away those Polaroids of naked youths in pig masks, then standing up, pale and sweaty, after mention of the Drowned Prophet.
He spent the next four and a half hours trailing around Selfridges after his targets.
‘He’s got a couple of suits and a watch out of her so far,’ Strike informed Barclay at three o’clock, when the latter arrived to take over.
‘Starting tae think I’m in the wrong line o’ work,’ said Barclay. ‘I could use a Rolex.’
‘If you can look that woman straight in the eye and tell her she’s beautiful, you deserve one.’
Strike left the store and walked off along Oxford Street, craving a kebab. He was crossing the road when his mobile rang again, this time from an unfamiliar number.
‘Strike.’
‘It’s me,’ said a woman’s voice.
‘Who’s “me”?’ asked Strike irritably.
‘Bijou. Don’t be angry. I had to ask Ilsa for your number again. This is serious, please don’t hang up.’
‘What d’you want?’
‘I can’t say it on the phone. Can I meet you?’
As Strike hesitated, a youth on a skateboard cuffed him in passing, making Strike yearn to slap the inconsiderate little fucker into the gutter.
‘I’m in Oxford Street. I can give you twenty minutes in the Flying Horse if you hurry.’
‘Fine,’ she said, and hung up.
It took Strike a quarter of an hour to reach the pub and he found Bijou already there, sitting at the tall table at the back beneath the glass cupola, wrapped in a black coat and nursing what looked like water. Strike bought himself a pint he felt he’d more than earned, and joined her at the high table.
‘Go on,’ he said, omitting a greeting.
Bijou glanced around before saying in a low voice,
‘Somebody’s bugged Andrew’s office. He thinks it was you.’
‘Oh, for fuck’s sake,’ said Strike, who felt he’d reached his full monthly capacity for unsought problems and obstacles. ‘It’ll be some bloody tabloid. Or his wife.’
‘I told him that,’ said Bijou, her bright blue eyes moist, ‘but he doesn’t believe me!’
‘Well, what d’you expect me to do about it?’
‘Talk to him,’ she whimpered. ‘Please.’
‘If he doesn’t believe you, why the hell would he believe me?’
‘Please, Cormoran! I’m – I’m pregnant!’
For a split second, he felt as though dry ice had slid down through his guts, and evidently his horror had shown on his face, because she said quickly,
‘Don’t worry, it’s not yours! I only just found out – it’s Andy’s, but—’
Bijou’s face crumpled and she buried her face in her beautifully manicured hands. Strike surmised that Andrew Honbold QC hadn’t evinced joy at the fact that an embryo of his own creation was currently nestling inside the cosmetically enhanced body of a mistress he now believed had had his office bugged.
‘Has Honbold had anyone new in his office lately? Taken meetings with anyone he hasn’t met before?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Bijou, raising a tearstained face. ‘I think it’s bloody Matilda. Will you talk to him? Please?’
‘I’ll think about it,’ said Strike, not because he felt any sympathy for Bijou, but because an idea had occurred to him that was as unpleasant as it was plausible. Bijou now reached a hand across the table, but Strike withdrew his own hand, unpleasantly reminded of Charlotte.
‘I was only going to thank you,’ she said, with the hint of a pout.
‘Don’t. I’m not promising to do anything.’
She slid off the bar stool and stood for a moment, looking at him, and even now, he sensed her wish for some sign that he still desired her, and he was again reminded of Charlotte.
‘Cormoran—’
‘I said I’ll think about it.’
She swept up her handbag and left.
Strike, who had paperwork waiting for him at the office, sipped his pint and tried to tell himself he didn’t want a burger and chips. There was a burning sensation behind his eyes, born of tiredness. His stomach growled. The myriad problems of the day seemed to buzz around him like mosquitos. Andrew Honbold, Bijou, Patterson: did he not have enough to worry about, without all these extraneous difficulties?
Caving in, he went to the bar to order food. Once back at the table beneath the cupola, Strike took out his phone and, in masochistic spirit, checked the Facebook account of Carrie Curtis Woods, who naturally hadn’t responded to his follower request, and Torment Town’s Pinterest page, on which no new comments had been posted since his own. Tired of the stalemate, he typed out another question for Torment Town, determined to force something out of whoever ran the account.
Did you ever know a woman called Deirdre Doherty?
He pressed send. If the drawing of the fair-haired woman in glasses floating in the dark pool was indeed supposed to be Deirdre, that, surely, would get a reaction.
He next looked up the phone number of Reaney’s wife’s nail salon, Kuti-cles. After asking for Ava there was a wait of a few seconds, then he heard her approaching the phone while talking loudly to someone in the background.
‘—keep ’em in there and don’t touch ’em. Hello?’
‘Hi, Mrs Reaney, it’s Cormoran Strike again. The private detective.’
‘Oh,’ said Ava, sounding displeased. ‘You.’
‘I’ve just heard some news about Jord—’
‘Yeah, I know he’s overdosed.’
‘I hear you called him a week before he did it. Was that about your divorce?’
‘I never called ’im. Why would I? ’E’s known abou’ the divorce for monfs.’
‘So you didn’t phone him a week ago?’
‘I ’aven’t called him in ages. I’ve changed my numbers to stop him pestering me. It’ll have been one of his girlfriends, pretending to be me to make sure ’e took the call. He’ll put his dick in anything, Jordan will. First ’e shags you, then ’e slaps you around. She’s welcome to ’im, whoever she is.’
‘Right,’ said Strike, thinking fast. ‘Seems an extreme reaction to the call, if it was just a girlfriend. Has he ever attempted suicide before?’
‘No, more’s the pity. Listen,’ she added, in a lower voice, ‘if you want the truth, I’d sooner ’e died. I won’t be looking over me shoulder for the rest of me life. Got it?’
‘Got it,’ said Strike. ‘Thanks for your time.’
He sat for another minute, thinking. Of course, the phone call from an unknown woman posing as Reaney’s wife might have had nothing whatsoever to do with Reaney’s suicide attempt; the connection might just be an assumption of Shanker’s mate’s.
His mobile rang again: the office number.
‘Hi Pat.’
‘Hi,’ she said. ‘Will you be coming back to the office this afternoon?’
‘In a bit. I’m having a late lunch at the Flying Horse. Why?’
‘I wanted a word with you.’
‘What kind of word?’ said Strike, frowning as he rubbed his sore eyes.
‘Well,’ said Pat, ‘I don’t think you’re going to like it.’
‘What is it?’ said Strike, now on the verge of losing his temper.
‘I just need to tell you something.’
‘Can you tell me what it is now?’ said Strike, whose neck was rigid with tension.
‘I’d rather say it face to face.’
What on earth the office manager needed to communicate in person Strike couldn’t imagine. However, he had a dim idea that if he employed a human resources person they’d advise him to accede to the request, and possibly not swear at Pat.
‘Fine, come up to the pub, I’m waiting for a burger,’ he said.
‘All right. I’ll see you in five minutes.’
The office manager and Strike’s burger arrived at exactly the same time. Pat took the seat Bijou had just vacated and Strike’s unease increased, because the expression on Pat’s monkeyish face was frightened, and she was clutching her handbag tightly on her lap, as though in self-protection.
‘Want a drink?’ he asked.
‘No,’ said Pat.
Much as he wanted his chips, Strike felt he ought to hear Pat out before eating.
‘Go on,’ he said. ‘What’s up?’
Pat swallowed.
‘I’m sixty-seven.’
‘You’re what?’
‘Sixty-seven. Years old,’ she added.
Strike merely looked at her.
‘I lied,’ croaked Pat. ‘On my CV.’
‘Yeah,’ said Strike. ‘You did.’
‘Well, I had to. Nobody wants anyone my age.’
Strike suspected he might know the reason Pat had suddenly come clean.
‘I’m fired, aren’t I?’ she said.
‘Oh Christ, don’t cry,’ said Strike, seeing her lip tremble: one bawling woman a day was enough. ‘Littlejohn knows this, I take it?’
‘How did you know that?’ gasped Pat.
‘Has he been blackmailing you?’
‘Not until just now,’ said Pat, retrieving a handkerchief from her handbag and pressing it against her eyes. ‘He told me he knew, right after he started with us. I couldn’t tell you without admitting how old I am, could I?
‘But I was in the loo just now and when I went in the office he was there, and he had the Edensor file and I think he was going to take photos of it, because he had his phone out. I said to him, “What the hell d’you think you’re doing?” and he closed the file and said, “You didn’t see that, and I’ll forget you’re a pensioner, all right?”’
‘You don’t think he got pictures?’
‘No, I heard him pass the loo. He wouldn’t have had time.’
Strike picked up a couple of chips and ate them, while Pat watched him. When Strike didn’t speak, she repeated,
‘I’m fired, aren’t I?’
‘You should’ve told me.’
‘You wouldn’t have hired me if I’d told the truth,’ said Pat, tears now falling faster than she could wipe them away.
‘I’m not talking about then, I’m talking about now. Stop bloody crying, you’re not fired. Where’m I going to get another manager like you?’
‘Oh,’ said Pat, and, pressing the handkerchief to her face, she began to cry in earnest.
Strike got to his feet and went to the bar, buying a glass of port, which was Pat’s preferred drink, and returning to set it down in front of her.
‘Why the hell d’you want to keep working at sixty-seven?’
‘’Cause I like working,’ gulped Pat, frantically wiping her face. ‘I get bored, sitting at home.’
‘Me too,’ said Strike, who’d been making certain deductions while at the bar. ‘So how old’s your daughter?’
‘Just turned fifty,’ muttered Pat. ‘I had her young.’
‘That’s why you bit my head off when I asked?’
Pat nodded.
‘Is she on Facebook?’
‘Never off it,’ said Pat, reaching for her port with an unsteady hand.
‘Then—’
‘Yeah. I’ll ask Rhoda. She’ll like helping,’ said Pat, taking a shaky sip of port.
‘Where’s Littlejohn now?’
‘He left. I made sure he’d really gone before I called you. He got in a taxi at the end of the road. He wasn’t happy I caught him. He’s off for a week now,’ said Pat, blowing her nose. ‘They’re going to Greece on holiday.’
‘By the time I’ve finished with him he’ll wish he’d bloody stayed there.’
He started on his burger. When Pat had finished her drink, she said,
‘Better get back, I was halfway through next week’s rota… thanks, Cormoran.’
‘You’re welcome,’ said Strike, through a mouthful of burger. Pat left.
Strike knew full well he was guilty of an inconsistency. He’d damned Littlejohn on the principle that where there was one lie, there were more, but he was confident that Pat’s lie hadn’t been born of a fundamental lack of honesty. Quite the reverse: she was often far too honest for his liking. In the early days of her employment he’d have jumped at the chance to fire her, but time had brought about a complete revolution in his feelings: now, he’d have been extremely loath to lose her. Nevertheless, he thought, as he reached absently for more chips, he might delay the pay rise he’d been planning to give her. Forgiveness was one thing, but it was a poor management strategy to reward employees for coming clean only when they were forced to do so.
For the next ten minutes, Strike was left alone to enjoy his burger. When at last he’d finished eating, he reached for his mobile and called Shanker back.
‘I want to trace the call Reaney got, before he overdosed. D’you know any bent screws up in Bedford?’
‘There’s always bent screws, Bunsen,’ said Shanker, cynical as ever.
‘Five hundred for you and five hundred for them, if they can give me any solid information about that call,’ said Strike recklessly, ‘particularly the number it was made from.’
