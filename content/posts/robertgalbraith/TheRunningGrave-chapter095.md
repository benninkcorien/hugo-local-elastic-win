The Running Grave
95
The undertaking requires caution… the dark nature of the present line suggests that it knows how to silence those who would raise the warning.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
To Robin’s enormous relief, her parents left for Yorkshire at midday on Sunday. This enabled her to finally complete the report about Chapman Farm she’d prepared for Strike. He’d now sent her a similar document, giving her all the information he’d found out while she’d been away. Robin was still reading this when Murphy arrived, straight from the airport.
She’d forgotten not only how good looking he was, but how kind. Though Robin had attempted to push her considerable worries aside in an effort to make the reunion a happy one, Ryan’s questions, which were mercifully posed without her mother’s hectoring undertone of accusation and outrage, elicited far more information than Linda had received about her daughter’s long stay at Chapman Farm. Robin also told Murphy what had happened when she was interviewed by PCs Khan and Harding.
‘I’ll find out what’s going on there,’ said Murphy. ‘Don’t worry about that.’
Slightly tipsy – alcohol was affecting her far more strongly after her long period of abstinence and her weight loss – Robin entered the bedroom. She’d bought condoms prior to Ryan’s arrival, having had an enforced break from the contraceptive pill over the last four months. Sex, which at Chapman Farm had been an almost constant danger rather than a pleasure, was as welcome a release as the wine, and temporarily obliterated her anxiety. As she lay in Murphy’s arms afterwards, her brain slightly fuzzy from alcohol and the tiredness she’d felt ever since she’d returned to London, he lowered his mouth to her ear and murmured,
‘I realised something while you were away. I love you.’
‘I love you, too.’
Caught off guard, she’d said the words automatically, as she’d done hundreds of times in the years she’d spent with Matthew. She’d said them even when she’d no longer meant them, because that was what you did when there was a wedding ring on your finger and you were trying to make a marriage work, even though the pieces were falling apart in your hands, and you didn’t know how to put them back together. Unease stirred in her alcohol-blunted brain. Had she just lied, or was she overthinking?
Murphy held her even closer, murmuring endearments, and Robin hugged him back and responded in kind. Even though Robin was dazed with wine and tiredness, she remained awake for half an hour after Murphy fell asleep. Did she love him? Would she have said it unprompted? She’d been truly happy to see him, they’d just had great sex and she was immensely grateful for his sensitivity and tact in the conversation about Chapman Farm, even if she’d left out some of the worst bits. But was what she felt love? Perhaps it was. Still ruminating, she sank into dreams of Chapman Farm, waking with a gasp at five in the morning, believing herself to be back in the box.
Murphy, who hadn’t meant to stay the night because he was due back at work the next day, had to leave the flat at six to return home and change. Robin, who’d arranged to pick Strike up in the Land Rover for their long drive to Thornbury, was dismayed by how relieved she felt not to have much time to talk to her boyfriend.
When she pulled up outside Wembley station, where she’d agreed to meet Strike at eight, she saw him already there, vaping while waiting.
‘Morning,’ he said, getting into the car. ‘How’re you feeling?’
‘Fine,’ said Robin.
While she looked slightly better rested than she had a week previously, she was still pale and drawn.
‘Murphy get back all right?’
‘Well, his plane didn’t crash, if that’s what you mean,’ said Robin, who really didn’t want to talk about Murphy at the moment.
Though surprised by this slightly caustic response, Strike was perversely encouraged: perhaps Robin and Murphy’s mutual attraction had petered out during four months of enforced separation? With the aim of emphasising that while Murphy might not appreciate her, he certainly did, he said,
‘So, I’ve read your report. Bloody good job. Good work on Fernsby and Huxley, as well.’
Robin’s online research, completed in the interval between her parents leaving and Ryan arriving, had enabled her to send Strike a long list of universities at which Walter had worked, the names of his ex-wife and two children, and the titles of his two out-of-print books.
As for Marion, Robin had discovered that she’d been raised as a Quaker and had been very active in the church until abandoning it for the UHC. Robin had also found the names and addresses of her two daughters.
‘Fernsby seems a restless kind of bloke,’ said Strike.
‘I know,’ said Robin. ‘Academics don’t usually move around that much, do they? But there were no start and finish dates, so it’s hard to know whether there was a period in between jobs he could have spent at the farm.’
‘And Marion deserted the family undertakers,’ said Strike.
‘Yes,’ said Robin. ‘She’s a bit pathetic. Utterly besotted with Jonathan Wace, but relegated to the laundry and the kitchen most of the time. I think her dream would be to become a spirit wife, but I don’t think there’s much chance. Bodies aren’t supposed to matter in there, but trust me, Wace isn’t sleeping with any women his own age. Not widows of undertakers, anyway – maybe if another Golden Prophet came along, he would.’
Strike wound down the window so he could continue vaping.
‘I don’t know whether you saw,’ he said, reluctant to introduce the subject but feeling it necessary, ‘but the UHC have been putting in more hours on Wikipedia. You’ve, ah, got your own page now.’
‘I know,’ said Robin. She’d found it the previous afternoon. It alleged she went to bed with any man from whom she wanted to elicit information, and that her husband had divorced her on account of these multiple infidelities. She hadn’t mentioned the existence of the Wikipedia page to Murphy. It might be irrational, but the baseless allegations had still made Robin feel grubby.
‘But I’m on it,’ said Strike. ‘Honbold’s been very helpful. He put me in touch with a lawyer who’s going to fire off some letters. I checked again this morning and Wikipedia’s already flagged both pages as unreliable. Just as well, because the UHC keeps adding more. Did you see the bit that went live last night, saying we team up with grifters and fantasists who’re after pay-offs?’
‘No,’ said Robin. This had evidently been added after Murphy arrived at her flat.
‘There are links to a couple of websites listing all the scumbags who’re helping to attack noble charitable enterprises. Kevin Pirbright, the Graves family, Sheila Kennett and all three Doherty siblings are listed. They say the Graves family neglected and mistreated Alexander, Sheila bullied her husband and that the Dohertys are drunks and layabouts. They also say Kevin Pirbright sexually abused his sisters.’
‘Why would they attack Kevin, now?’
‘Must be worried we talked to him before he died. They haven’t bothered smearing Jordan Reaney; s’pose he’s done a good enough job himself, and they haven’t gone after Abigail Glover, either. Presumably Wace would rather not draw the press’s attention to the fact his own daughter ran away from the church at sixteen – but the odds of press interest in all these ex-members just got a lot higher, so I thought I’d better call and warn them.’
‘How did they take it?’
‘Sheila was upset and I think Niamh’s regretting talking to us now.’
‘Oh, no,’ said Robin sadly.
‘She’s worried about the effect on her brother and sister. Colonel Graves told me he wanted to “let the damned UHC have it with both barrels”, but I told him retaliating through the press will just draw more attention to the online bullshit and that I’m on it, legally. He’s pleased we’re about to interview Cherie-slash-Carrie. And I don’t know how Abigail’s feeling, because she didn’t pick up.’
Strike’s mobile now rang. Pulling it out of his pocket, he saw an unknown number.
‘Hello?’
‘Nicholas Delaunay here,’ said a cool, upper-class voice.
‘Hi,’ said Strike, switching to speakerphone and mouthing ‘Graves’ son-in-law’ at Robin. ‘Apologies for the noise, we’re—’
‘On your way to interview Cherie Gittins,’ said Delaunay. ‘Yes. M’father-in-law told me. Evidently you didn’t listen to a damn word my wife said, at the Hall.’
‘I listened to all your wife’s words.’
‘But you’re still determined to wreak havoc?’
‘No, just determined to do my job.’
‘And bugger the consequences, is that it?’
‘As I can’t predict the consequences—’
‘The consequences, which were entirely predictable, are already on the bloody internet! You think I want my children to see what’s been written about their mother’s family, their family—?’
‘Do your children regularly Google my agency, or the UHC?’
‘You’ve already admitted that, entirely due to you, the press are likely to be on the prowl—’
‘It’s a possibility, not a likelihood.’
‘Every moment those defamatory bloody lies are up, there’s a risk journalists will see them!’
‘Mr Delaunay—’
‘It’s Lieutenant-Colonel Delaunay!’
‘Ah, my apologies, Lieutenant-Colonel, but your parents-in-law—’
‘They might’ve bloody well agreed to all this, but Phillipa and I didn’t!’
‘I’m surprised I have to say this to a man of your rank, but you don’t actually feature in this chain of command, Lieutenant-Colonel.’
‘I’m involved, my family’s involved, and I have a right—’
‘I answer to my client, and my client wants the truth.’
‘Whose truth? Whose truth?’
‘Is there more than one?’ said Strike. ‘Better update my library of philosophy.’
‘You jumped-up bloody monkey,’ shouted Delaunay, and he hung up. Grinning, Strike returned his phone to his pocket.
‘Why did he call you a monkey?’ said Robin, laughing.
‘Slang for military police,’ said Strike. ‘Still better than what we called the navy.’
‘What was that?’
‘Cunts,’ said Strike.
He glanced into the back seat and saw a carrier bag.
‘No biscuits,’ said Robin, ‘because you said you’re still dieting.’
Strike sighed as he hoisted the bag into the front to take out the flask of coffee.
‘Is Delaunay really this angry just because of his children?’ asked Robin.
‘No idea. Maybe. Can’t see why he and his wife haven’t just told them what happened. Lies like that always come back to bite you on the arse.’
They drove on in silence for a couple of minutes, until Robin said,
‘Have you talked to Midge yet, about going undercover in Zhou’s clinic?’
‘No,’ said Strike, who was now pouring himself coffee. ‘I wanted to discuss that with you, in the light of this Wikipedia stuff. I think we’ve got to assume the church will be trying to identify all our operatives, and have you looked at Zhou’s clinic’s website? Seen how much even a three-day stay costs?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘Well, even if they haven’t yet identified Midge as one of ours, I’m not sure she’d blend in that well. She doesn’t come across as the kind of woman who’s prepared to waste money on crackpot treatments.’
‘Which particular treatments are you calling crackpot?’
‘Reiki,’ said Strike. ‘Know what that is?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, smiling, because she knew her partner’s aversion to anything that smacked of mysticism. ‘The practitioner puts their hands on you, to heal your energy.’
‘Heal your energy,’ scoffed Strike.
‘An old schoolfriend of mine had it done. She said she could feel heat moving all over her body wherever the hands went and felt a real sense of peace afterwards.’
‘Tell her if she slings me five hundred quid, I’ll fill her a hot water bottle and pour her some gin.’
Robin laughed.
‘You’ll be telling me I’m not a Gift-Bearer-Warrior next.’
‘Not a what?’
‘That’s what Zhou told me I was,’ said Robin. ‘You had to fill in a questionnaire and you got typed according to your answers. The categories aligned with the prophets.’
‘Christ’s sake,’ muttered Strike. ‘No, what we need is someone who looks the part, designer clothes and the right moneyed attitude… Prudence would’ve been ideal, come to think of it, but as she’s seriously pissed off at me just now…’
‘Why’s she pissed off?’ said Robin, concerned.
‘Didn’t I—? Shit, I forgot to put Torment Town into your update.’
‘Torment – what?’
‘Torment Town. It’s – or it was – an anonymous account on Pinterest. I was looking for pictures of the Drowned Prophet and found a cache of horror-style drawings, all UHC-themed. A picture of Daiyu caught my eye, because it genuinely looked like her. I complimented the artist, who thanked me, then I said, “You aren’t keen on the UHC, are you?” or words to that effect, and they went quiet.
‘But there was this one picture Torment Town had drawn, of a woman floating in a dark pool, with Daiyu hovering over her. The woman was blonde, wearing glasses and looked a lot like that old picture of Deirdre Doherty we got from Niamh. Having had no response to my UHC question for days, I thought, fuck it, and asked the artist if they’d ever known a woman called Deirdre Doherty, at which point the whole account disappeared.
‘Fast-forward to the night you were taken in for questioning: I get a phone call from Prudence, accusing me of tracking down her client and threatening her.’
To Strike’s surprise, Robin said nothing at all. Glancing at her, he thought she looked even paler than she had on getting into the car.
‘You all right?’
‘What shape was the pool?’ said Robin.
‘What?’
‘The pool in Torment Town’s drawing. What shape?’
‘Er… a pentagon.’
‘Strike,’ said Robin, whose ears were ringing, ‘I think I know what happened to Deirdre Doherty.’
‘D’you want to pull over?’ Strike asked, because Robin had turned white.
‘No, I – actually,’ said Robin, who was feeling light-headed, ‘yes.’
Robin indicated and pulled over onto the hard shoulder. Once they were stationary, she turned a stricken face to Strike and said,
‘Deirdre drowned in the temple, during the Manifestation of the Drowned Prophet. The pool in the Chapman Farm temple’s five-sided. Deirdre had a weak heart. They must’ve wanted to punish her for what she’d written about Wace raping her, but it went too far. She either drowned, or had a heart attack.’
Strike sat in silence for a moment, considering the probabilities, but could find no flaw in Robin’s reasoning.
‘Shit.’
Robin’s head was swimming. She knew exactly what Deirdre Doherty’s last moments on earth must have felt like, because she’d been through exactly the same thing, in the very same pool. Deirdre, too, would have seen fragments of her life flicker before her – her children, the husband who’d abandoned her, perhaps snapshots of a long-gone childhood – and then the water would have crushed the air from her lungs, and she’d have drunk in fatal quantities, and suffocated in darkness…
‘What?’ she said numbly, because Strike was talking and she hadn’t heard a word.
‘I said: so we’ve got a witness to the church committing manslaughter, and possibly even murder, and they’re on the outside?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, ‘but we don’t know who they are, do we?’
‘That’s where you’re wrong. I know exactly who they are – well,’ Strike corrected himself, ‘I’d be prepared to bet a grand on it, anyway.’
‘How on earth can you know that?’
‘Worked it out. For starters, Prudence doesn’t come cheap. She’s very well regarded in her field and she’s written successful books. You’ve seen the house they live in – she sees clients in a consulting room opposite the sitting room. She’s very discreet and never names names, but I know perfectly well her client list’s full of fucked-up A-listers and wealthy people who’ve had breakdowns, so whoever Torment Town is, they or their family must have money. They’re also likely to be living in or close to London. Prudence let slip that the client’s female, and we know Torment Town must have been at Chapman Farm at the same time as Deirdre Doherty.’
‘So…’
‘It’s Flora Brewster, the housing heiress. She was listed as living at Chapman Farm on the 2001 census. Flora’s friend Henry told me she stayed in the church for five years and Deirdre disappeared in 2003.
‘According to Fergus Robertson, his contact’s family shunted her off to New Zealand after her suicide attempt, but Henry Worthington-Fields says Flora’s back in the country now, though still in poor mental health. He begged me not to go near her, but I know where she’s living, because I looked her up: Strawberry Hill, a five-minute walk from Prudence and Declan’s.’
‘Oh,’ said Robin. ‘But we can’t approach her, can we? Not if she’s that fragile.’
Strike said nothing.
‘Strike, we can’t,’ said Robin.
‘You don’t want justice for Deirdre Doherty?’
‘Of course I do, but—’
‘If Brewster wanted to keep what she witnessed private, why draw it and post it on a public forum?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Robin distractedly. ‘People process things differently. Maybe, for her, that was a way of letting it all out.’
‘She’d have done better to let it out to the bloody police, instead of doing drawings and moaning about how miserable she feels to Prudence.’
‘That’s not fair,’ said Robin heatedly. ‘Speaking as someone who’s experienced what goes on at Chapman Farm—’
‘I don’t see you sitting on your arse feeling sorry for yourself, or deciding you’ll just draw pictures of everything you witnessed—’
‘I was only in for four months, Flora was there five years! You told me she was gay and forced to go with men – that’s five years of corrective rape. You realise that as far as we know, Flora might have had kids in there that she was forced to leave when they chucked her out?’
‘Why didn’t she go back for them?’
‘If she had the full-on mental breakdown Henry described to you, she might have believed they were in the safest place: somewhere they’d grow up with the approval of the Drowned Prophet! Everyone comes out of that place altered, even the ones who seem all right on the surface. D’you think Niamh would have ended up married to a man old enough to be her dad if her family hadn’t been smashed up by the church? She went for safety and a father figure!’
‘But you’re happy for Niamh to never to know what happened to her mother?’
‘Of course I’m not happy,’ said Robin angrily, ‘but I don’t want it on my conscience if we tip Flora Brewster into a second suicide attempt!’
Now regretting his tone, Strike said,
‘Look, I didn’t mean to—’
‘Don’t say you didn’t mean to upset me,’ said Robin through gritted teeth. ‘That’s what men always say when – I’m angry, not sad. You don’t get it. You don’t know what that place does to people. I do, and—’
Strike’s mobile rang again.
‘Shit,’ he said. ‘Abigail Glover. Better take this.’
Robin looked away at the passing traffic, arms folded. Strike answered the call and switched it to speakerphone, so Robin could listen.
‘Hi.’
‘’I,’ said Abigail. ‘I got your message, about press.’
‘Right,’ said Strike. ‘Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but as I said, I don’t think there’s any immediate—’
‘I wanna ask you somefing,’ said Abigail, cutting across him.
‘Go on.’
‘Did Baz Saxon come an’ see you?’
‘Er – yeah,’ said Strike, deciding honesty was the best policy.
‘That fucker!’
‘Did he tell you himself or…?’
‘Fuckin’ Patrick told me! Me lodger. I’ve ’ad enough. I’ve told Patrick to get the fuck out of my flat. It’s all a fuckin’ game to them, pair of bastards,’ she added, and Strike could hear distress as well as anger now. ‘I’m sick an’ fuckin’ tired of bein’ their fuckin’ reality show!’
‘I think a new lodger’s a good move.’
‘So what did Baz tell you? ’Ow I’ll fuck anyfing that moves except ’im, was it?’
‘He certainly struck me as a man with a grievance,’ said Strike. ‘But since you’re on the line, I wondered whether you could answer a couple more questions?’
‘You don’—’
Her voice was momentarily drowned out, as two articulated lorries roared past the stationary Land Rover.
‘Sorry,’ said Strike, his voice raised. ‘I’m on the A40, I missed most of that.’
‘I said,’ she shouted, ‘you don’ wanna believe anyfing that bastard says abou’ me – except that I freatened ’im. I did freaten ’im. I’d ’ad a coupla drinks, an’ ’e was buttin’ in on me an’ Darryl, this guy from my gym, an’ I lost it.’
‘Understandable,’ said Strike, ‘but when you told Saxon the church had guns, was that to frighten him, or true?’
‘To frighten ’im,’ said Abigail. After a slight hesitation she added, ‘but I migh’ – they migh’ not’ve been real. I dunno. I couldn’t swear to it in court tha’s wha’ I saw.’
‘So you did see a gun, or guns?’
‘Yeah. Well – that’s what they looked like.’
Robin now turned her head to look at the phone in Strike’s hand.
‘Where were these guns?’ Strike asked.
‘Mazu ’ad ’em. I wen’ in ’er study one day to tell ’er sumfing an’ I saw the safe open an’ she slammed the door. It looked like two guns. She’s weird about Chapman Farm, I toldja. It’s ’er private kingdom. She usedta talk about when the police come, when the Crowthers were there. When I saw them guns, I fort, she’s not gonna be caught out again – but I dunno, they might not ’ave been real, I on’y saw ’em for a second.’
‘No, I appreciate that,’ said Strike. ‘While I’ve got you, I also wanted to ask—’
‘Did Baz tell you about my nightmare?’ asked Abigail, in a deadened voice.
Strike hesitated.
‘Yes, but that isn’t what I was going to ask about, and let me emphasise, as far as I’m concerned, the fact that you and your friend tried to prevent a whipping says far more—’
‘Don’ do that,’ said Abigail. ‘Don’t fuckin’ – don’t try an’ make – bastards. I’m not even allowed to ’ave private fuckin’ nightmares.’
‘I appreciate—’
‘Oh, fuck off,’ said Abigail. ‘Just fuck off. You don’t “appreciate”. You don’t know nuffing.’
Strike could tell she was now crying. Between the small noises coming out of the phone and his partner’s stony stare from the seat beside him, he didn’t feel particularly good about himself.
‘Sorry,’ he said, though not very sure what he was apologising for, unless it was letting Barry Saxon into his office. ‘I wasn’t going to mention any of that. I was going to ask you about Alex Graves’ sister, Phillipa.’
‘What about ’er?’ said Abigail, in a thickened voice.
‘You told me your father had her eating out of his hand, when we met.’
‘’E did,’ said Abigail.
‘She hung around the farm a bit, then, did she?’
‘Coming to see ’er bruvver, yeah,’ said Abigail, who was clearly trying to sound natural. ‘Wha’re you doing on the A40?’
‘Going to Thornbury.’
‘Never ’eard of it. OK, well – I’ll let you go.’
And before Strike could say anything else, she hung up.
Strike looked around at Robin.
‘What d’you think?’
‘I think she’s right,’ said Robin. ‘We should go.’
She turned the engine on and, having waited for a break in the traffic, pulled back out onto the road.
They drove on for five minutes without talking to each other. Keen to foster a more congenial atmosphere, Strike finally said,
‘I wasn’t going to bring up her nightmare. I feel bad about that.’
‘And where’s this sensitivity when it comes to Flora Brewster?’ said Robin coldly.
‘Fine,’ said Strike, now nettled, ‘I won’t go near bloody Brewster, but as you’re the one who’s experienced the full bloody horror of Chapman—’
‘I never called it “horror”, I’m not saying I went through war crimes or anything—’
‘Fuck’s sake, I’m not saying you’re exaggerating how bad it was, I’m saying, if there’s a witness to them actually killing someone, I’d have thought—’
‘The fact is,’ said Robin angrily, ‘Abigail Glover’s more your kind of person than Flora Brewster is, so you feel bad for making her choke up, whereas—’
‘What’s that mean, “more my kind of—”?’
‘Pulls herself up by her bootstraps, joins the fire service, pretends none of it ever hap—’
‘If it makes you feel any better, she’s got a borderline drink problem and seems recklessly promiscuous.’
‘Of course it doesn’t make me feel better,’ said Robin furiously, ‘but you’re chippy about rich people! You’re judging Flora because she can afford to see Prudence and she’s “sitting on her arse”, whereas—’
‘No, it’s about Brewster doing art instead of—’
‘What if she was so mentally ill she wasn’t sure what was real or not? You didn’t press Abigail on what these supposed guns looked like, did you?’
‘She’s not bloody drawing them and posting them online with UHC logos attached! I note Brewster’s not so fucking ill she didn’t go to ground the moment I mentioned Deirdre Doherty, thinking, “Shit, that got a bit more attention than I wanted!”’
Robin made no response to this, but stared steely-eyed at the road ahead.
The frosty atmosphere inside the car persisted onto the motorway, each partner consumed by their own uncomfortable thoughts. Strike had had the always unpleasant experience of having his own prejudices exposed. Whatever he might have claimed to Robin, he had formed an unflattering mental picture of the young woman who’d drawn the corpse of Deirdre Doherty, and if he was absolutely honest (which he had no intention of being out loud), he had classed her with the women enjoying reiki sessions at Dr Zhou’s palatial clinic, not to mention those of his father’s children who lived off family wealth, with expensive therapists and private doctors on hand should they need them, cushioned from the harsh realities of working life by their trust funds. Doubtless the Brewster girl had had a bad time of it, but she’d also had years in the Kiwi sunshine to reflect upon what she’d seen at Chapman Farm, and instead of seeking justice for the woman who’d drowned and closure for the children now bereft of a mother, she’d sat in her comfortable Strawberry Hill flat and indulged in a spot of art.
Robin’s inner reverie was disturbing in a different way. While she stood by what she’d just said to her partner, she was uncomfortably aware (not that she intended to admit this) that she’d subconsciously wanted to force an argument. A small part of her had sought to disrupt the pleasure and ease she’d felt on finding herself back in the Land Rover with Strike, because she’d just told Murphy she loved him, and shouldn’t be feeling unalloyed pleasure at the prospect of hours on the road with somebody else. Nor should she be thinking about the man she supposedly loved with guilt and discomfort…
The silence in the car lasted a full half an hour, until Robin, resenting the fact that she was the one to have to break the ice, but ashamed of the hidden motive that had led her to become so heated, said,
‘Look, I’m sorry I got shirty. I’m just – I’m probably more on Flora’s side than you are because—’
‘I get it,’ said Strike, relieved that she’d spoken. ‘No, I don’t mean – I know I haven’t been in the Retreat Rooms.’
‘No, I can’t see Taio wanting to spirit bond with you,’ said Robin, but the mental image of Taio trying to lead Strike, who was considerably larger, towards one of the wooden cabins made her laugh.
‘No need to be offensive,’ said Strike, reaching for the coffee again. ‘We might’ve had a beautiful thing together if I hadn’t brained him with those wire cutters.’
