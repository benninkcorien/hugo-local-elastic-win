The Running Grave
122
At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative. A just and valid cause must exist, and the obedience and coordination of the troops must be well organized, otherwise the result is inevitably failure.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Of the many things that needed to be done before the agency could prove how, why and by whose contrivance Daiyu Wace had disappeared forever, Strike allocated one of the most important to Sam Barclay, whom he recalled from Norwich the day after the shooting, after Robin had gone home to catch up on some sleep. Both partners had agreed that the so far fruitless exercise of waiting for Emily Pirbright to appear with a collecting tin should now be abandoned, and the agency’s efforts turned instead towards proving that the myth of the Drowned Prophet was entirely baseless.
‘How far am I allowed to go, tae worm my way in wi’ this guy?’ asked Barclay, who’d just pocketed the name, address, place of work and photograph, all gleaned online by Strike, of the man who Strike wanted him to befriend, by whatever means necessary.
‘Unlimited alcohol budget. Doubt he’s into drugs. Milk the military. Big yourself up.’
‘A’right, I’ll get ontae it.’
‘And be careful. There’s a gun out there that’s still got bullets in the chamber.’
Barclay gave a mock salute and departed, passing Pat in the doorway.
‘I’ve called all these people,’ she told Strike, holding in her hand a piece of paper on which Strike had listed the names and numbers of Eric Wardle, who was his best friend in the Metropolitan Police; Vanessa Ekwensi, who was Robin’s; DI George Layborn, who’d rendered the agency significant help in a previous case, and Ryan Murphy. ‘I’ve only been able to get hold of George Layborn so far. He says he could meet you Wednesday evening, next week. I’ve left messages with the rest of them. I don’t see why Robin can’t ask Ryan herself.’
‘Because this is coming from me,’ said Strike. ‘I need to meet them all simultaneously, and lay out everything we’ve got, so we can hit the UHC as hard as possible, right when Wace and his lawyers aren’t expecting it.’
‘They still haven’t found that bloke who shot at you two and Will,’ grumbled Pat. ‘Don’t know what we pay our bloody taxes for.’
Blurry pictures of the Ford Focus with the fake plates had been appearing on various news channels all morning, with appeals to the public for any information. Though thankful his and Robin’s names hadn’t appeared in the press, Strike had had to take two cabs already that morning, and knew he’d need to hire himself a car for work purposes before the police were through with his own.
‘Dennis just called, by the way,’ Pat added. ‘Will’s feeling a bit better.’
‘Great,’ said Strike, who’d already endured ten solid minutes’ grousing from Pat about the state of shock in which Will had been returned to her house in the early hours of the morning. ‘Any news on him talking to my lawyer friend about immunity from prosecution?’
‘He’s thinking about it,’ said Pat.
Strike suppressed any expression of frustration at what he considered Will Edensor’s idiotic stubbornness.
Pat returned to her desk, e-cigarette between her teeth, and Strike rubbed his eyes. He’d insisted on walking Robin to her taxi at six o’clock, telling her it was imperative that neither of them took any more risks. In spite of their sleepless night, he hadn’t been to bed: there was too much to think about, to organise and to do, and it must all be done methodically and stealthily if they were to have any chance of taking on the UHC without anyone else getting shot through the head.
His mobile rang and he groped for it.
‘Hi,’ said Robin’s voice.
‘You were supposed to be getting some sleep.’
‘I can’t,’ said Robin. ‘I came home, got into bed, lay there awake for an hour then got back up again. Too much coffee. What’s going on there?’
‘I’ve seen Barclay and I’ve called Ilsa,’ said Strike, suppressing a yawn. ‘She’s happy to represent Will and Flora, if they’re agreeable. Shah’s on his way to Birmingham.’
Strike heaved himself up onto his feet and glanced down into the street again. The tall, fit-looking black man with green eyes had reappeared since he’d last looked, though on this occasion he was marginally better hidden than previously, in a doorway four along from the office on the other side of the street.
‘We’re still being watched,’ Strike informed Robin, ‘but only by the clown squad. He wasn’t there when I went out to Cedar Terrace this morning.’
‘You went? I thought we agreed neither of us was going to take stupid risks?’
‘I couldn’t send Shah, Barclay was still in Norwich and Midge was asleep. Anyway, it wasn’t a risk,’ said Strike, letting the blinds fall back into place. ‘There was never going to be a safer time to go and talk to Rosie Fernsby than while police are hunting the shooter. Trouble with trying to kill people you’re afraid know too much is, if you miss, you’ve not only handed them confirmation of their theory, you’ve made yourself a target. Anyway,’ Strike continued, dropping back into his chair, ‘Rosie-Bhakta was there.’
‘She was?’ said Robin, sounding excited.
‘Yeah. She’s bloody annoying, although maybe I’d’ve found her less so if I wasn’t this knackered. Says she doesn’t ever bother answering the landline because it’s only ever for her mother – predictably, given it’s her mother’s house.’
‘What did she say about the Polaroids?’
‘Exactly what we expected her to say. She was quite excited to think she might be in danger, though. I’ve persuaded her to move to a B&B at Colin Edensor’s expense.’
‘Good. Listen, I’m worried about Midge going back to Chapman Farm—’
‘She’ll want to do it. She’s constantly pissed off I don’t let her do dangerous stuff. However bloody insubordinate she can be, nobody could call her a coward.’
Robin, who’d rolled her eyes at the word ‘insubordinate’, said,
‘And what if they’ve put up cameras at the blind spot now?’
‘Unless they’re night vision cameras she’ll be OK, as long as she’s well covered and got the wire cutters. We’ve got to chance it. Without forensic evidence, we’re going to be bloody hard-pressed to prove what happened…
‘I’ve got Pat typing up a final report on Toy Boy, by the way. You’ll like this: Dev caught him in the same hotel as Bigfoot, with another Eastern European girl.’
‘No way.’
‘Yeah, so I’ve passed those photos to the client. Toy Boy’s seen his last Rolex. You and I will have to cover Hampstead while the others are working the UHC case. With luck, the clowns watching us will think we’ve lost interest in the church now we’ve been shot at.’
‘I’m worried about Sam, though. What if—?’
‘Barclay can handle himself fine,’ said Strike. ‘Stop worrying about him and Midge and concentrate on the fact that we’re trying to take down a bunch of fuckers who’re brainwashing thousands, raping people and selling kids.’
‘I am concentrating on that,’ said Robin crossly. ‘For your information, I’ve spent the last six hours combing through every other Isaac Mills in the UK.’
‘And?’
‘And there are two more Isaac Millses who’re the right age. One’s a chartered accountant, the other’s in jail.’
‘Very promising,’ said Strike. ‘Which jail?’
‘Wandsworth.’
‘Even better,’ said Strike. ‘Won’t be a long trip. What’s he in for?’
‘Manslaughter. I’m doing some more digging right now.’
‘Great.’ Strike scratched his chin, thinking. ‘If he’s the right one, you should visit him. Might require a lighter touch than I gave Reaney.’
He chose not to say that Mills was likely to fancy a visit from an attractive young woman far more than he’d want to meet a broken-nosed forty-one-year-old man.
‘This is all going to take time to arrange,’ said Robin, sounding worried.
‘Doesn’t matter. We do this properly or not at all. I’m trying to fix up a meeting with all our police contacts—’
‘I know, Ryan just called me, he got Pat’s message,’ said Robin.
Then why the fuck didn’t he call Pat? was Strike’s immediate, ungracious thought.
‘He can’t do anything until next week.’
‘Nor can Layborn,’ said Strike. ‘I might give them all a little kick up the arse, tell them my journalist contact is gagging to write a piece about the church and police apathy, and that I’m barely holding him off.’
‘Would you mind not?’ said Robin. ‘Or not unless it’s absolutely necessary?’
‘You’re the one who wants to speed things up,’ said Strike.
And nobody made you start seeing that prick Murphy.
