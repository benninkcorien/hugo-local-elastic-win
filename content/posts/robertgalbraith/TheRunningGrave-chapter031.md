The Running Grave
31
Nine in the fifth place…
One should not try an unknown medicine.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
‘You catch on quick,’ said Jiang, as he and Robin walked back past the chicken coop.
‘What d’you mean?’ asked Robin.
‘Knowing the right responses,’ said Jiang, again rubbing the eye with the tic, and Robin thought she detected a hint of resentment. ‘Already.’
To their left lay the open fields. Marion Huxley and Penny Brown were staggering over the deeply rutted earth, leading the Shire horses in their endless ploughing, a pointless exercise, given that the field was already ploughed.
‘Metal Group,’ said Jiang with a snigger. Confirmed in her impression that this morning’s group reconfiguration had been a ranking exercise, Robin merely asked,
‘Why does Dr Zhou want to see me?’
‘Medical,’ said Jiang. ‘Check you’re ready to fast.’
They passed the laundry and dining hall, and then the older barns, one of which had a cobwebbed padlock on the door.
‘What do you keep in there?’ Robin asked.
‘Junk,’ said Jiang. Then, making Robin jump, he bellowed,
‘Oi!’
Jiang was pointing at Will Edensor, who was crouching in the shade of a tree off the path and appeared to be comforting a child of maybe two, who was crying. Will Edensor jumped up as though he’d been scalded. The little girl, whose white hair hadn’t been shaved like that of the other children, but stood out around her head like a dandelion clock, raised her arms, imploring Will to pick her up. A group of nursery age were toddling about behind him among more trees, under the supervision of shaven-headed Louise Pirbright.
‘Are you on child duty?’ Jiang shouted at Will.
‘No,’ said Will. ‘She just fell over, so I—’
‘You’re committing materialist possession,’ shouted Jiang, and specks of spittle issued from his mouth. Robin was sure her presence was making Jiang more aggressive, that he was enjoying asserting his authority in front of her.
‘It was only because she fell over,’ said Will. ‘I was going to the laundry and—’
‘Then go to the laundry!’
Will hurried off on his long legs. The little girl attempted to follow him, tripped, fell and cried harder than ever. Within a few seconds, Louise had scooped the child up and retreated with her into the trees where the rest of the little ones were roaming.
‘He’s been warned,’ said Jiang, heading off again. ‘I’m going to have to report that.’
He seemed to take pleasure in the prospect.
‘Why isn’t he allowed near children?’ asked Robin, hurrying to keep up with Jiang as they rounded the side of the temple.
‘Nothing like that,’ said Jiang quickly, answering an unspoken question. ‘But we’ve got to be careful about who works with the little ones.’
‘Oh, right,’ said Robin.
‘Not because of – it’s spiritual,’ growled Jiang. ‘People get ego hits from materialist possession. It interferes with spiritual growth.’
‘I see,’ said Robin.
‘You’ve got to kill the false self,’ said Jiang. ‘He hasn’t killed his false self yet.’
They were now crossing the courtyard. When they crouched down at the pool of the Drowned Prophet between the tombs of the Stolen and Golden Prophets, Robin picked up a tiny pebble lying on the ground and hid it in her left hand before dipping the forefinger of her right into the water, anointing her forehead and intoning ‘The Drowned Prophet will bless all who worship her.’
‘You know who she was?’ Jiang asked Robin, as he stood up and pointed at the statue of Daiyu.
‘Er – her name was Daiyu, wasn’t it?’ said Robin, still with the tiny pebble held in her closed hand.
‘Yeah, but d’you know who she was? To me?’
‘Oh,’ said Robin. She’d already learned that the naming of family relationships was frowned upon at Chapman Farm, because it suggested a continuing allegiance to materialist values. ‘No.’
‘My sister,’ said Jiang in a low voice, smirking.
‘Can you remember her?’ said Robin, careful to sound awed.
‘Yeah,’ said Jiang. ‘She used to play with me.’
They proceeded towards the entrance of the farmhouse. As Jiang drew a little ahead of her to push open the dragon-ornamented doors of the farmhouse, Robin stowed the tiny pebble out of sight down the front of her sweatshirt, inside her bra.
There was a motto inlaid in Latin in the stone floor just inside the doors of the farmhouse: STET FORTUNA DOMUS. The hallway was wide, pristinely clean and immaculately decorated, the white walls covered in Chinese art, including framed silk panels and carved wooden masks. A scarlet-carpeted stairway curved up to the first floor. A number of closed doors, all painted in glossy black, led off the hall, but Jiang led Robin past all of these and turned right, into a corridor that led into one of the new wings.
At the very end of the corridor, he rapped on another glossy black door and opened it.
Robin heard a woman’s laughter, and as the door opened she saw actress Noli Seymour leaning up against an ebony desk and apparently lost in merriment about something Dr Zhou had just said to her. She was a dark, elfin young woman with cropped hair, wearing what Robin recognised as head-to-toe Chanel.
‘Oh, hello,’ she said through her laughter. Robin had the impression Noli vaguely recognised Jiang, but couldn’t remember his name. Jiang’s hand had again leapt to his winking eye. ‘Andy’s just making me roar… I had to come down here to get my treatments,’ she pouted slightly, ‘seeing as he’s abandoned us in London.’
‘Abandoned you? Never,’ said Zhou, in his deep voice. ‘Now, you’ll stay for the night? Papa J’s back.’
‘Is he?’ squealed Noli, clapping her hands to her face in delight. ‘Oh my God, I haven’t seen him in weeks!’
‘He says you can take your usual room,’ said Zhou, pointing upstairs. ‘The membership will be delighted to see you. Now, I have to assess this young lady,’ he said, pointing at Robin.
‘All right, darling,’ said Noli, offering her face to be kissed. Zhou clasped her hands, pecked her on each cheek, and Noli walked out past Robin in a cloud of tuberose, winking as she passed and saying:
‘You’re in very safe hands.’
The door closed on Noli and Jiang, leaving Robin and Dr Zhou alone.
The luxurious, meticulously tidy room smelled of sandalwood. A red and gold art deco rug lay on the dark polished floorboards. Floor-to-ceiling shelves of the same ebony as the rest of the furniture carried leatherbound books and also what Robin recognised as hundreds of journals of the kind lying on her bed, their spines labelled with the names of their owners. Behind the desk were more shelves carrying hundreds of tiny brown bottles arranged with precision and labelled in minuscule handwriting, a collection of antique Chinese snuff bottles and a fat golden Buddha, sitting cross-legged on a wooden plinth. A black leather examination couch stood beneath one of the windows, which looked out onto a part of the property screened from the courtyard by trees and bushes. Here, Robin saw three identical cabins built of timber, each of which had sliding glass doors, and which hadn’t been shown to any of the new recruits as yet.
‘Please, sit down,’ said Zhou, smiling as he gestured Robin to the chair opposite his desk, which like the desk was made of ebony, and upholstered in red silk. Robin registered how comfortable it was as she sank into it: the chairs in the workshop were of hard plastic and wood, and the mattress of her narrow bed very firm.
Zhou was wearing a dark suit and tie and a pristine white shirt. Pearls shone discreetly in the buttonholes of his cuffs. Robin assumed he was biracial because he was well over six feet tall – the Chinese men she was used to seeing in Chinatown, near the office, were generally much shorter – and he was undeniably handsome, with his slicked-back black hair and high cheekbones. The scar running down from nose to jaw hinted at mystery and danger. She could understand why Dr Zhou attracted television viewers, even though she personally found the sleekness and slight but detectable aura of self-importance unappealing.
Zhou flipped open a folder on his desk and Robin saw several sheets of paper, with the questionnaire she’d completed on the bus lying on top.
‘So,’ said Zhou, smiling, ‘how are you finding life in the church so far?’
‘Really interesting,’ said Robin, ‘and I’m finding the meditation techniques incredible.’
‘You suffer from a little anxiety, yes?’ said Zhou, smiling at her.
‘Sometimes,’ said Robin, smiling back.
‘Low self-esteem?’
‘Occasionally,’ said Robin, with a little shrug.
‘I think you’ve recently had an emotional blow?’
Robin wasn’t sure whether he was pretending to intuit this about her, or admitting that some of the hidden sheets of paper contained the biographical details she’d confided in church members.
‘Um… yes,’ she said, with a little laugh. ‘My wedding got called off.’
‘Was that your decision?’
‘No,’ said Robin, no longer smiling. ‘His.’
‘Family disappointed?’
‘My mum’s quite… yes, they weren’t happy.’
‘I promise, you’ll live to be very glad you didn’t go through with it,’ said Zhou. ‘Much societal unhappiness stems from the unnaturalness of the married state. Have you read The Answer?’
‘Not yet,’ said Robin, ‘although one of the church members offered to lend me his copy, and Mazu was just…’
Zhou opened one of the desk drawers and took out a pristine paperback copy of Jonathan Wace’s book. The image on the front was of a bursting bubble, with two hands making the heart shape around it.
‘Here,’ said Zhou. ‘Your own copy.’
‘Thank you so much!’ said Robin, feigning delight while wondering when on earth she was supposed to have time to read, in between the lectures, the work and the temple.
‘Read the chapter on materialist possession and egomotivity,’ Zhou instructed her. ‘Now…’
He extracted a second questionnaire, this one blank, and took a lacquered fountain pen out of his pocket.
‘I’m going to assess your fitness to fast – what we call purification.’
He took down Robin’s age, asked her to step onto scales, noted down her weight, then invited her to sit down again so he could take her blood pressure.
‘A little low,’ said Zhou, looking at the figures, ‘but it’s nearly lunchtime… nothing to worry about. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.’
While Zhou pressed the cold head of the stethoscope to her back, Robin could feel the tiny pebble she’d tucked inside her bra sticking into her.
‘Very good,’ said Zhou, putting the stethoscope away, sitting and making a note on the questionnaire before continuing his questions on pre-existing health conditions.
‘And where did you get that scar on your forearm?’ he asked.
Robin knew at once that the eight-inch scar, which was currently covered by the long sleeves of her sweatshirt, must have been reported by one of the women in the dormitory where she undressed at night.
‘I fell through a glass door,’ she said.
‘Really?’ said Zhou, for the first time showing some disbelief.
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘It wasn’t a suicide attempt?’
‘God, no,’ said Robin, with an incredulous laugh. ‘I tripped down some stairs and put my hand right through a glass panel in a door.’
‘Ah, I see… you were having regular sex with your fiancé?’
‘I – yes,’ said Robin.
‘Were you using birth control?’
‘Yes. The pill.’
‘But you’ve come off it?’
‘Yes, the instructions said—’
‘Good,’ said Zhou, still writing. ‘Synthetic hormones are exceptionally unhealthy. You should put nothing unnatural in your body, ever. The same goes for condoms, caps… all disrupt the flow of your qi. You understand qi?’
‘In our lecture, Taio said it’s a sort of life force?’
‘The vital energy, composed of Yin and Yang,’ said Zhou, nodding. ‘You have a slight imbalance already. Don’t worry,’ he said smoothly, still writing, ‘we’ll address it. Have you ever had an STD?’
‘No,’ lied Robin.
In fact, the rapist who’d ended her university career had given her chlamydia, for which she’d been given antibiotics.
‘Do you orgasm during sex?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin. She could feel a blush rising in her face.
‘Every time?’
‘Pretty much,’ said Robin.
‘Your typology test places you in the decant Fire-Earth, which is to say, Gift-Bearer-Warrior,’ went on Zhou, looking up at her. ‘That’s a very auspicious nature.’
Robin didn’t feel particularly flattered by this assessment, not least because she’d answered as the fictional Rowena, rather than herself. She also had a feeling ‘Gift-Bearer’ might be a synonym for financial target. However, she said with enthusiasm,
‘That’s so interesting.’
‘I devised the typology test myself,’ said Zhou, with a smile. ‘We find it very accurate.’
‘What type are you?’ asked Robin.
‘Healer-Mystic,’ said Zhou, evidently pleased to be asked, as had been Robin’s intention. ‘Each quintant corresponds to one of our prophets and one of the five Chinese elements. You may have noticed that we name our groups for the elements. However,’ said Zhou seriously, now sitting back in his chair, ‘you mustn’t think I subscribe to any one rigid tradition. I favour a synthesis of the best of world medicine. Ayurvedic practices have much to recommend them, but as you’ve seen, I don’t disdain the stethoscope or blood pressure gauge. However, I have no truck with Big Pharma. A global protection racket. Not a single cure to their names.’
Rather than challenging this statement, Robin settled for looking mildly confused.
‘True healing is only possible from the spirit,’ said Zhou, placing a hand on his chest. ‘There’s ample evidence of the fact, but of course, if the whole world subscribed to the UHC healing philosophy, those companies would lose billions in revenue.
‘Are your parents still together?’ he asked, with another swift change of subject.
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘You have siblings?’
‘Yes, a sister.’
‘Do they know you’re here?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘Are they supportive? Happy for you to explore your spiritual growth?’
‘Er – they’re a bit – I think,’ said Robin, with another little laugh, ‘they think I’m doing it because I’m depressed. Because of the wedding being cancelled. My sister thinks it’s a bit weird.’
‘And you, do you think it’s weird?’
‘Not at all,’ said Robin defiantly.
‘Good,’ said Zhou. ‘Your parents and sister currently regard you as their flesh object. It will take time to reorientate yourself to a healthier pattern of bonding.
‘Now,’ he said briskly, ‘you are fit to undergo a twenty-four-hour fast, but we need to address this qi imbalance. These tinctures,’ he said, getting to his feet, ‘are very effective. All natural. I mix them myself.’
He chose three small brown bottles from the shelf, poured Robin a glass of water, added two drops from each bottle, swilled the glass then handed it over to her. Wondering whether it was reckless to drink something of which she didn’t know the ingredients, though reassured by the tiny quantities, Robin finished it all.
‘Good,’ said Zhou, smiling down at her. ‘Now, if you have negative thoughts, you know what to do, yes? You have your chanting meditation and your joyful meditation.’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, smiling as she set the empty glass back on the desk.
‘All right then, you’re fit to fast,’ he said, in a tone that was a clear dismissal.
‘Thanks so much,’ said Robin, getting up. ‘Can I ask –’ she pointed at the timber cabins visible through the study window ‘– what are those? We didn’t see them on our tour.’
‘Retreat Rooms,’ said Zhou. ‘But they’re for use only by full church members.’
‘Oh, I see,’ said Robin.
Zhou showed her to the door. Robin was unsurprised to find Jiang waiting for her in the corridor. She’d already learned that the only permissible reason to be left unattended was to visit the bathroom.
‘It’s lunchtime,’ said Jiang, as they walked back through the farmhouse.
‘Good,’ said Robin. ‘I’m fasting tomorrow, better build up my strength.’
‘Don’t say that,’ said Jiang severely. ‘You shouldn’t prepare for fasting, except spiritually.’
‘Sorry,’ said Robin, intentionally sounding cowed. ‘I didn’t mean – I’m still learning.’
When they stepped out into the courtyard they found it full of church members heading towards the dining hall. There was something of a crowd around the pool of the Drowned Prophet as people waited to ask for her blessing.
‘Actually,’ Robin said to Jiang, ‘I might just nip to the bathroom before lunch.’
She left before he could protest, heading into the women’s dormitory, which was deserted. Having used the bathroom, she hurried to her bed. To her surprise, a second object lay on her pillow beside her nightly journal: a very old, dog-eared copy of the same paperback she held in her hands. Opening it, she saw a flamboyant handwritten inscription inside.
To Danny, Martyr-Mystic,
my hope, my inspiration, my son.
With love always, Papa J
Robin remembered Danny Brockles’ insistence that she return the book to him, so she placed her own copy of The Answer on the bed and picked up his to take it to lunch. She then dropped to her knees, extracted the tiny pebble from the yard from her bra and placed it carefully beside three others, which she’d hidden between the bedframe and mattress. She’d have known it was Tuesday without this method of counting the passing days, but she also knew that if her fatigue and hunger worsened, checking the number of pebbles she’d collected might be her only recourse for keeping track of the passing days.
