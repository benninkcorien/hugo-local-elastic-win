The Running Grave
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My deepest gratitude as ever to my wonderful editor (and fellow cult aficionado) David Shelley. I promised you a cult book, and here, at last, we are.
A very big thank you to Nithya Rae for her superb copyediting, especially for catching date and numerical slip-ups.
To my fabulous agent, Neil Blair, who was one of this book’s early readers, thank you for all your hard work on my behalf, and for being such a good friend.
Thank you as always to Nicky Stonehill, Rebecca Salt and Mark Hutchinson, who provide endless support, wise guidance and many laughs.
My gratitude to Di Brooks, Simon Brown, Danny Cameron, Angela Milne, Ross Milne, Fiona Shapcott and Kaisa Tiensuu: I say it every time, but without you, there could be no books at all.
Lastly, to Neil Murray, who really didn’t fancy a book about a cult, but who likes The Running Grave the best of the series: see? I always know best – except on the many occasions when you do x
