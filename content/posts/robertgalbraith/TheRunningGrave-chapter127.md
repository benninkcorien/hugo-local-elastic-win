The Running Grave
127
Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different from fire…
The I Ching or Book of Changes
It took Strike forty-five minutes to reach the fire station where Abigail was working that evening. It was a large, Art Deco building of grey stone, with the usual large, square openings below for the fire trucks.
Upon entering, Strike found a man in his forties scribbling a note at a desk in an otherwise deserted reception area. When Strike enquired whether Abigail Glover was currently on the premises, he said yes, she was upstairs. When Strike said his business was urgent, the fireman called upstairs on a wall-mounted phone, his expression amused. Strike wondered whether he had, again, been mistaken for one of Abigail’s boyfriends.
She descended the stairs a few minutes later, looked disconcerted and irritable, for which Strike couldn’t blame her; he, too, preferred not to be disturbed at work. She was wearing the regulation firemen’s overalls, though without the jacket. Her black top was tight-fitting, and he assumed she’d been mid-way through changing when he’d interrupted her.
‘Why’re you ’ere?’
‘I need your help,’ said Strike.
‘People norm’lly dial 999,’ said Abigail, to a snigger from her colleague.
‘It’s about Birmingham,’ said Strike.
‘Birmingham?’ Abigail repeated, frowning.
‘Yeah. Shouldn’t take long, but I think you’re the only person who can clarify a couple of points.’
Abigail cast a look behind her.
‘Earwiggin’, Richard?’
‘No,’ said the man. He disappeared upstairs perhaps a little faster than he’d have done otherwise.
‘All right,’ Abigail said, turning back to Strike, ‘but you’re gonna ’ave to ’urry up, ’cause my shift’s ended and I’ve got a date.’
‘Fair enough,’ said Strike.
She led him through a door to the right, which was evidently used for talks and meetings, because a number of steel-legged plastic chairs were stacked in corners. Abigail proceeded to a small table near a whiteboard at the far end, lifting down a chair for herself on the way.
‘It’s you, innit?’ she said to Strike, over her shoulder. ‘’Oo’s caused the shitstorm at Chapman Farm?’
‘Ah, you’ve seen,’ said Strike.
‘It’s all over the fuckin’ news, ’course I ’ave.’
‘I’d like to take credit,’ said Strike, also picking up a chair and taking it to the table, ‘but that’s mostly down to my detective partner.’
‘Did she get your client’s relative out, before she torched the place?’ asked Abigail, as both sat down.
‘She did, yeah,’ said Strike.
‘Blimey. You don’ wanna let ’er go in an ’urry.’
‘I don’t intend to,’ said Strike.
‘It’s gonna mean the press coming for me, though, innit?’ said Abigail, looking tense as she pulled a pack of nicotine gum out of her pocket and put a piece in her mouth.
‘Probably,’ said Strike. ‘I’m sorry about that.’
‘When Dick called just now, I fort, “This is it. A journalist’s come”… go on, then. What about Birmingham?’
‘We’ve found out your father was supposed to be taking Rosie Fernsby up to Birmingham the morning Daiyu disappeared, but he changed his plans.’
‘Rosie ’oo?’
She wasn’t at the farm long,’ said Strike. ‘Pretty girl. Dark, curvy – she was there with her father and twin brother.’
‘Oh, yeah… twins. Yeah, I remember them,’ said Abigail. ‘I’d never met twins before. I didn’t know you could have boy and girl ones… no fuckin’ education,’ she added bitterly. ‘Like I told you before.’
‘When we interviewed Cherie Gittins, she tied herself up in knots a bit about your father’s whereabouts.’
‘Found Cherie, didja? Bloody ’ell.’
‘Yeah, she was married and living in the West Country. Anyway, she seemed to attach a lot of significance to the question of whether or not your father was at the farm when Daiyu disappeared.’
‘Well, I dunno why she was confused. ’E was definitely there when the police come to say Daiyu ’ad drowned. I remember Mazu screaming and collapsin’ and ’im ’olding ’er up.’
‘When were you sent up to Birmingham, exactly?’ asked Strike.
‘Exactly? Dunno. After Daiyu’s inquest.’
‘Had there been any question of you going to Birmingham before Daiyu disappeared?’
‘They prob’lly discussed it when I wasn’ around,’ said Abigail, with a slight shrug. ‘Mazu wanted shot of me for years, and Daiyu dyin’ gave ’er an excuse to do it. I din’t give a shit, personally. I fort it’d probably be easier to escape from one of the other places, din’t fink eiver of ’em would be as ’ard to get in an’ out of as Chapman Farm, an’ I was right.’
‘Yeah, one of my operatives got into Birmingham without too much difficulty, on an out-of-date police ID.’
‘Find anyfing interesting?’
‘A lot of babies,’ said Strike.
‘’Spect there is a lot, now,’ said Abigail. ‘No birf control.’
‘How long were you at the farm, between Daiyu’s disappearance and leaving for Birmingham?’
‘Dunno. Week or two. Somefing like that.’
‘And when you were transferred to Birmingham, did anyone from Chapman Farm go with you?’
‘Yeah, bloke called Joe. ’E was older’n me an’ ’e was one of my farver and Mazu’s favourites. ’E wasn’ going up there ’cos ’e was being punished, though, ’e was gonna be second in command in the Birmingham Centre.’
‘And it was just you and Joe who were transferred that day, was it?’
‘Yeah, ’s far as I can remember.’
Strike turned a page in his notebook.
‘You remember Alex Graves’ family? Father, mother and sister?’
‘Yeah, I told you I did,’ said Abigail, frowning.
‘Well, Graves’ father thinks your father ordered Cherie Gittins to kill Daiyu.’
Abigail chewed her gum for a few seconds in silence, then said,
‘Well, that’s the sort of stupid fing people say, innit? When they’re angry. Why’s my farver s’posed to ’ave killed ’er?’
‘To get his hands on the quarter of a million pounds Graves left Daiyu in his will.’
‘You’re shittin’ me. She ’ad a qua’er of a million?’
‘If she’d lived, she’d also have inherited the Graves family home, which is probably worth ten times that.’
‘Jesus!’
‘You didn’t know she had that much money?’
‘No! Graves looked like a tramp, I never knew ’e ’ad any money of ’is own!’
‘Do you think a quarter of a million would be a sufficient motive for your father to want Daiyu dead?’
Abigail chewed her gum vigorously, still frowning, before saying,
‘Well… ’e’d’ve liked the money. ’Oo wouldn’t? But of course ’e didn’ fuckin’ tell Cherie to do it. ’E wouldn’t’ve wanted to upset Mazu.’
‘Your father sent you a message, when I met him.’
‘You’ve met ’im?’
‘Yeah. He invited me backstage after his Olympia rally.’
‘An’ ’e sent me a message?’ she said incredulously.
‘Yeah. “Popsicle misses you.”’
Abigail’s lip curled.
‘Bastard.’
‘Him, or me?’
‘’Im, obviously. Still tryna…’
‘To…?’
‘Tug the ’eartstrings. It’s been twenny fuckin’ years an’ not a fuckin’ word, an’ ’e finks I’ll fuckin’ melt if ’e says fuckin’ “Popsicle”.’
But he could tell she was disturbed by the thought of her father sending her a message, even if it was difficult to tell whether anger or pain predominated.
‘I can understand why you don’t like the idea of your father drowning people,’ he said. ‘Not even Daiyu.’
‘What d’you mean, “not even Daiyu”? Yeah, she was spoiled, but she was still a fuckin’ kid, wasn’ she? An’ what d’you mean “people”? ’E didn’t drown my muvver, I toldja that last time!’
‘You wouldn’t be the first person who found it hard to believe their own flesh and blood could do terrible things.’
‘I’ve got no fuckin’ problem believin’ my farver does terrible fuckin’ fings, fanks very much!’ said Abigail angrily. ‘I was there, I saw what was fuckin’ goin’ on, I know what they do to people inside that fuckin’ church! They did it to me, too,’ she said, thumping herself in the chest. ‘So don’ tell me I don’ know what my farver is, because I fuckin’ do, but ’e wouldn’t kill members of ’is own—’
‘You were family, and as you’ve just said, he did terrible things to you, too.’
‘’E didn’t – or not… ’e let bad stuff ’appen to me, yeah, but that was all Mazu, an’ it was mostly when ’e was away. If that’s all about Birmingham—’
She made to stand up.
‘Just a couple more points, if you don’t mind,’ said Strike, ‘and this first one’s important. I want to ask you about Becca Pirbright.’
