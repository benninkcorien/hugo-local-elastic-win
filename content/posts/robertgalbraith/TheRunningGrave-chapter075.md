The Running Grave
75
Thus the superior man controls his anger
And restrains his instincts.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
‘What d’ye think?’
Strike, who’d just finished reading Robin’s latest missive from Chapman Farm, looked up at Barclay, who’d brought the letter back from Norfolk twenty minutes previously and now stood in the doorway of the inner office, holding a mug of coffee Pat had made him.
‘It’s time for her to come out,’ said Strike. ‘We might have enough here for a police investigation, if they haven’t taken this Lin girl to hospital.’
‘Aye,’ said Barclay, ‘and that’s before ye get tae the sexual assault.’
Strike said nothing, dropping his eyes again to the last few lines of Robin’s letter.
and Wace groped me. He didn’t get far, because Mazu and Becca came in.
I know you’ll say I should come out, but I’ve got to find out whether Will could be persuaded to leave. I can’t come out now, I’m too close. One more week might do it.
Please, if you can, check and see whether Lin was admitted to the local hospital, I’m worried sick about her.

‘Yeah, she definitely needs to come out,’ said Strike. ‘Next letter, I’ll tell her to wait by the rock and we’ll pick her up. Enough’s enough.’
He was worried, not only by what Robin termed Wace’s grope – what exactly did that mean? – but by the fact she’d witnessed something that was highly incriminating of the church. This, of course, was exactly what she’d gone to Chapman Farm to do, but Strike hadn’t anticipated Robin hanging around afterwards, a dangerous witness to serious wrongdoing. While he understood why she’d admitted seeing Lin with those plants, she’d seriously compromised herself by doing so, and ought to have got out immediately that had happened. There was a board on the wall behind him showing how many people had died or disappeared in the vicinity of Papa J.
‘What?’ he said, under the impression that Barclay had just spoken to him.
‘I said, what’re ye up tae this morning?’
‘Oh,’ said Strike. ‘Sacking Littlejohn.’
He brought up a photograph on his phone, then handed it to Barclay.
‘First thing he did when he got back from Greece was go and see Patterson. About bloody time I got something for all the money I’ve been shelling out.’
‘Great,’ said Barclay. ‘Can we replace him wi’ whoever took this picture?’
‘Not unless you want this office stripped of everything sellable by Tuesday.’
‘Where ye gonnae do it?’
‘Here. He’s on his way.’
‘Can I stay an’ watch? Might be my one and only chance tae hear his voice.’
‘Thought you were on Frank Two?’
‘I am, aye,’ sighed Barclay. ‘Which means I’ll be watchin’ him watchin’ Mayo for hours. If they’re gonnae make a move, I wish they’d fuckin’ hurry up.’
‘Keen to see our client kidnapped, are you?’
‘Ye know what I mean. This could go on for months.’
‘I’ve got a feeling it’s going to hot up pretty soon.’
Barclay left. Strike heard him pass Littlejohn in the doorway with pleasure: he was looking forward to this.
‘Morning,’ said Littlejohn, appearing in the doorway Barclay had just vacated, his short salt-and-pepper hair as neat as ever, his world-weary eyes fixed on Strike. ‘Can I get a coffee before—?’
‘No,’ said Strike. ‘Come in, sit down and close the door.’
Littlejohn blinked, but did as he was bid. Now looking wary, he crossed to Robin’s chair at the partners’ desk and sat down.
‘Care to explain that?’ asked Strike, pushing his phone across the desk, face up, displaying a photograph taken the previous day of Littlejohn and Patterson outside the latter’s office in Marylebone.
The silence that ensued lasted nearly two minutes. Strike, who was inwardly debating whether Littlejohn was about to say ‘I just bumped into him’ or ‘OK, fair cop,’ allowed the silence to spool through the room undisturbed. At last, the subcontractor made a noise somewhere between a grunt and a gasp. Then, which Strike hadn’t anticipated, he began to cry.
If Strike had been asked to rank everyone he’d witnessed crying recently according to how much sympathy he felt for their distress, he’d have given Bijou last place without hesitation. Now, however, he realised there was a category of weeper he despised even more than a woman who’d played a duplicitous game that had blown up in her face: a man who’d done his best to take down another person’s business, destroy that person’s reputation, undermine an investigation into men stalking a woman, and cause that woman additional fear and alarm, all of which he’d presumably done for money, but who now seemed to expect pity for being found out.
While tempted to give the man what Strike would have considered a proper reason for crying, he judged that there might be capital to be made out of what he supposed was Littlejohn’s attempt to show contrition. Strike therefore made no comment as Littlejohn sobbed, but waited to see what came next.
‘I’m in a lot of debt,’ Littlejohn finally blurted out. ‘I got myself in trouble. Online gambling. Blackjack. I’ve got a problem.’
I’ll show you fucking problems. You wait.
‘How’s that relevant?’
‘I’m up to my ears,’ sobbed Littlejohn. ‘The wife doesn’t know how bad it is. Mitch,’ said Littlejohn, brandishing the phone showing Patterson’s picture, ‘gave me a loan to get the worst people off my back. Interest-free.’
‘In exchange for which, you agreed to take me down.’
‘I never—’
‘You posted a snake through Tasha Mayo’s door. You tried to gain entry to this office when there shouldn’t have been anyone here, presumably to bug it. You were caught by Pat trying to take pictures of the Edensor—’
‘She’s lied to you, that Pat.’
‘If you’re about to tell me she’s sixty-seven, I already know. Big fucking deal.’
Littlejohn’s disappointment that this titbit was of no use was palpable, but Strike was pleased to learn that ratting other people out was Littlejohn’s preferred strategy for getting out of messes. Much could be done with such a man.
‘Why’s Patterson doing this?’ asked Strike.
‘He’s got a real fucking thing about you,’ said Littlejohn, trying to stem the stream of snot from his nose. ‘He’s an old mate of Roy Carver’s. He blames you for Carver getting forced out and it pisses him off you get all the publicity, and clients want you, not him. He says you’re taking all his business. He was really fucked off about Colin Edensor sacking us and coming here instead.’
Tears were still dripping from Littlejohn’s world-weary eyes.
‘I prefer working for you, though. I’d rather stay here. I could be useful to you.’
With immense difficulty, Strike refrained from asking what use he could possibly have for a treacherous, weak-willed man who had neither the morals to refuse to terrorise a woman who was already scared, nor the brains to stop himself being rumbled as a saboteur. Strike could only assume it was this mixture of delusion and wishful thinking that had led Littlejohn to lose a fortune at blackjack.
‘Well, if you want to be useful,’ said Strike, ‘you can start now. Give me my phone.’
He brought up the picture of the black-haired woman who’d been skulking on the corner of Denmark Street.
‘Who’s she?’
Littlejohn looked at the picture, swallowed, then said,
‘Yeah, she’s one of Mitch’s. I told him I thought you were having me watched. He put Farah on you as a back-up.’
‘What’s her full name?’ said Strike, opening his notebook.
‘Farah Navabi,’ muttered Littlejohn.
‘And what would you know about bugs in Andrew Honbold’s office?’
‘Nothing,’ said Littlejohn, too fast.
‘Listen,’ said Strike quietly, leaning forwards. ‘Honbold’s not going to let just anyone in there. His wife’s got him bang to rights already, she doesn’t need to bug him to take him to the cleaners. Somebody thought it was worth their while to put an illegal bug in Honbold’s office, and my name and Honbold’s have been in the press lately. So when I go and see Honbold and show him Patterson’s picture, your picture, Farah’s—’
‘It was Farah,’ muttered Littlejohn.
‘Thought it might be,’ said Strike, sitting back in his chair. ‘Well, I think we’re done here. You’ll understand why, under the circumstances, I won’t be asking Pat to give you the salary you’re owed.’
‘No, listen,’ said Littlejohn, in what looked like panic: evidently he could see his employment with Patterson Inc terminating soon as well. ‘I’ve got more stuff for you.’
‘Like what?’
Littlejohn pulled his own phone out of his pocket, tapped something into it, then shoved it across the desk. Strike found himself looking down at a photograph of Midge and Tasha Mayo laughing together outside Mayo’s Notting Hill house, both holding bags of Waitrose shopping.
‘Scroll right,’ said Littlejohn.
Strike did so and saw a picture of Midge leaving Mayo’s house by evening.
‘The second one was last night,’ said Littlejohn. ‘I was going to give it to Mitch.’
‘I’m sure there’s an innocent explanation,’ said Strike, who was sure of nothing of the sort. ‘If that’s your best shot—’
‘It’s not – I’ve got stuff on Patterson.’
‘I’ll get it myself if I want it.’
‘No, listen,’ said Littlejohn again, ‘I can get you something for that church case. Mitch has got a recording. He didn’t hand it over when Edensor sacked him.’
‘What recording would this be?’ asked the sceptical Strike.
‘Of that Kevin whatever he was called, who got out of the church – Kevin Purvis?’
‘Pirbright,’ said Strike.
‘Yeah, exactly. Mitch got an undercover recording of him.’
‘Why would Patterson covertly record Pirbright, when Pirbright had already told Colin Edensor everything he knew?’
‘They fell out, Pirbright and Edensor,’ said Littlejohn. ‘Didn’t they? Before Pirbright got shot? They weren’t talking to each other.’
Strike’s interest level rose slightly, because it was true Sir Colin and Kevin Pirbright had argued, then had little contact, in the interval between Kevin heckling Giles Harmon at his book reading, and Pirbright’s murder.
‘There was an email, I think it was an email, Pirbright sent to Edensor,’ Littlejohn went on, his expression pleading, ‘where Pirbright said he was piecing things together he’d repressed or something, right? Mitch was getting nowhere on the case, so he sent Farah to chat up Pirbright and see what new stuff she could get out of him. Pirbright wasn’t right mentally, see, so Mitch was worried if they interviewed him over the counter, Pirbright might blab on his blog. He was getting too mouthy.’
‘Why didn’t Patterson hand over this recording to Edensor?’
‘Because it’s shit quality. You can’t hear much. Farah fucked up, but she told Mitch afterwards Pirbright didn’t have anything useful to say anyway.’
‘And this is the valuable bit of evidence you think will persuade me to keep you in employment? A recording you can’t hear, of a conversation containing nothing useful?’
‘Yeah, but it’s you, isn’t it?’ said Littlejohn, desperate. ‘You can do something with it.’
If there was one thing that truly added insult to injury, in Strike’s opinion, it was attempts to flatter in the aftermath of proven treachery. Once again, it cost him some effort to suppress a straightforward ‘go fuck yourself’.
‘If it’s useless, why didn’t Patterson chuck it?’
‘He did – well, he chucked it in the safe and forgot about it. I saw it in there last time I opened it.’
‘All right,’ said Strike slowly, ‘bring me that recording and we can have another talk about your employment prospects.’
A very short fucking talk.
‘Thank you,’ said Littlejohn effusively. ‘Thank you, Cormoran, I can’t thank you enough. I really need this job, you don’t understand what it’s been like for me, the strain of everything, but as long as I’ve got regular work I can work something out, get a loan or something – you won’t regret this. I’m a loyal man,’ said Littlejohn shamelessly, ‘I don’t forget a good turn. You won’t have anyone more dedicated to this agency—’
‘You can save all that. You haven’t brought back the recording yet.’
Once Littlejohn was safely out of the office, Strike called Midge.
‘Wotcha,’ she said, answering after a couple of rings.
‘Want to tell me why you’re going shopping with our client?’
‘What?’ said Midge, startled.
‘You. Tasha Mayo. Waitrose,’ said Strike, barely keeping a lid on his temper.
‘I weren’t shopping with her,’ said Midge, sounding incredulous. ‘One of them split, that’s all.’
‘One of what split?’
‘One of her bags, what d’you think? I just helped her pick it all up.’
‘And how’s that keeping undercover, helping her pick up all her shopping?’
‘Fook’s sake, Strike,’ said Midge, now sounding annoyed, ‘what were I s’posed to do, stand there and watch her chasing tins all over the road? I’d’ve looked more suspicious if I hadn’t helped her. It’s what women do, help each other out.’
‘Why were you leaving her house last night?’
‘It weren’t bloody night, it was barely nine o’clock – and how d’you—?’
‘Answer the bloody question.’
‘She called me,’ said Midge, now sounding nettled. ‘She heard noises outside the back door. Her brother’s gone back up north and she’s jumpy being there alone, after you put the fear of God into her about the Franks.’
‘What was the noise?’
‘A cat knocked off a dustbin lid.’
‘How long were you inside her house?’
‘Dunno, ’bout an hour?’
‘The fuck were you doing in there for an hour?’
‘I told you, she’s jumpy! How d’you even—?’
‘You were photographed. Littlejohn’s just shown me the pictures.’
‘That fookin’ arsehole,’ gasped Midge.
‘What happened while you were inside the house?’
‘The fook are you insinuating?’ said Midge hotly.
‘I’m asking you a straightforward question.’
‘We had a coffee, all right?’
‘And how the bloody hell did you not notice Littlejohn was watching the house?’
‘He weren’t there. It must’ve been someone else.’
‘I’m taking you off the Mayo case,’ said Strike. ‘You can stick with Toy Boy going forwards.’
‘I’ve done nothing wrong!’ said Midge. ‘Ask Tasha!’
‘It’s what it’ll look like to the papers,’ said Strike.
‘Did you think of that when you shagged that lawyer with the fake tits?’
‘I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that,’ said Strike, through clenched teeth. ‘I’ve told you how it’s going to be. Stay away from Mayo.’
He hung up, seething.
