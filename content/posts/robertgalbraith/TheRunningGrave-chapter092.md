The Running Grave
92
The power of the inferior people is growing.
The danger draws close to one’s person; already there are clear indications…
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Relieved by the prospect of getting back to the investigation on Monday, Robin took the lift back upstairs to her flat. In the sitting room she quietly closed her laptop, with the intention of resuming work once her parents were safely tucked into the sofa bed that evening, then accepted a fresh mug of tea and a chocolate éclair from her mother.
‘What did he want?’ Linda said, sitting herself down on the sofa.
‘To tell me to take it easy and eat cake, so he’d be happy about this,’ she added, indicating the éclair.
‘So Ryan’s coming home on—?’
‘Next Sunday, unless he gets an earlier flight,’ said Robin.
‘We do like Ryan,’ said Linda.
‘I’m glad,’ said Robin, pretending she hadn’t heard the unspoken but not Strike.
‘He’s been very good about keeping us updated,’ added Linda, again with a silent addendum: unlike Strike. ‘D’you think he’d like children?’
Oh, for God’s sake.
‘No idea,’ lied Robin. Ryan had in fact made it perfectly clear he’d like children.
‘He always asks after Annabel,’ said Linda warmly, referring to Robin’s niece. ‘Actually – we’ve got news. Jenny’s pregnant again.’
‘Fantastic!’ said Robin, who liked her sister-in-law, but wondered why this information had so far been withheld from her.
‘And,’ said Linda, taking a deep breath. ‘Martin’s girlfriend’s pregnant, too.’
‘I didn’t even know he had a girlfriend,’ said Robin. Martin, who came immediately after her in birth order, was the only son who still lived with their parents, and had a patchy job history.
‘They’ve only been together three months,’ said Linda.
‘What’s she like?’
Linda and Michael looked at each other.
‘Well,’ said Linda, and the monosyllable rang with disapproval.
‘She likes a drink,’ said Michael.
‘She’s called Carmen,’ said Linda.
‘Is Martin pleased?’
‘We don’t really know,’ said Linda.
‘Might be the making of him,’ said Robin, who wasn’t convinced, but felt it was best to be optimistic in front of her parents.
‘That’s what I said,’ said Michael. ‘He’s talking about getting his HGV licence. Long-distance lorry driving, you know.’
‘Well, he’s always liked driving,’ said Robin, choosing not to mention the many near misses Martin had had, full of drink and bravado.
‘Like you,’ said her father, ‘with that advanced driving qualification.’
Robin had taken her advanced driving course in the months after the rape that had finished her university career, when command of a vehicle had given her back a sense of safety and control. Relieved to be offered a conversational topic that was neither children nor her career, Robin began to talk about the old Land Rover, and whether it would pass its next MOT.
The afternoon passed relatively peacefully because Robin found a documentary on TV which fortunately caught both her parents’ interest. Itching to return to her laptop but afraid of disturbing the precarious calm, Robin watched mindlessly until, with evening drawing in, she suggested a takeaway, and ordered a Deliveroo.
The pizzas had only just been delivered when the buzzer beside the flat door sounded.
‘Robin Ellacott?’ said a tinny male voice, when Robin pressed the intercom.
‘Yes?’
‘This is PC Blair Harding. Could we come in?’
‘Oh, yes, of course,’ said Robin, pressing the button to let them through the outer door downstairs.
‘What do the police want with you?’ said Linda, looking alarmed.
‘It’s OK,’ said Robin soothingly. ‘I’ve been waiting for this – I gave a statement about something I witnessed at Chapman Farm.’
‘What thing?’
‘Mum, it’s fine,’ said Robin, ‘it’s to do with someone who wasn’t getting proper medical attention. The police said they’d get back to me.’
Rather than be drawn into further explanations, Robin stepped out onto the landing to wait for the police to arrive, wondering how strange the police might think her if she asked for the update on Jacob downstairs, in their car.
The lift doors opened a couple of minutes later to reveal a white male officer and a far shorter Asian policewoman, whose black hair was pulled back into a bun. Both looked serious, and Robin felt suddenly anxious: was Jacob dead?
‘Hi,’ she said apprehensively.
‘Robin Ellacott?’
‘Yes – is this is about Jacob?’
‘That’s right,’ said the policewoman, glancing at the open door to Robin’s flat. ‘Is that where you live?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, disconcerted by the sternness of the officers’ expressions.
‘Can we go in?’ said the female officer.
‘Yes, of course,’ said Robin.
Linda and Michael, who’d both got to their feet, looked worried to see the two officers entering the flat after their daughter.
‘These are my parents,’ said Robin.
‘Hi,’ said the male officer. ‘I’m PC Harding and this is PC Khan.’
‘Hello,’ said Linda uncertainly.
‘You obviously know what this is about,’ said PC Khan, looking at Robin.
‘Yes. Jacob. What’s happened?’
‘We’re here to invite you down to the station, Mizz Ellacott,’ said PC Harding.
Robin, who was experiencing a slow-motion lift-drop of the stomach without knowing exactly why, said,
‘Can’t you just tell me what’s happened here?’
‘We’re inviting you to an interview under caution,’ said PC Khan.
‘I don’t understand,’ said Robin. ‘Are you saying I’m under arrest?’
‘No,’ said PC Harding. ‘This would be a voluntary interview.’
‘What about?’ said Linda, before Robin could get the words out.
‘We’ve had an accusation of child abuse,’ said PC Harding.
‘Against – against me?’ said Robin.
‘That’s right,’ said PC Harding.
‘What?’ exploded Linda.
‘It’s a voluntary interview,’ said PC Harding again.
Robin was vaguely aware that Linda was talking, but couldn’t take in what she was saying.
‘Fine,’ said Robin calmly. ‘Let me get my coat.’
However, the first thing she did was to go back to the table, pick up a pen and scribble down Strike’s mobile number, the only one she knew by heart other than her own.
‘Phone Strike,’ she told her father, pressing the number into his hands.
‘Where are you taking her?’ Linda demanded of the officers. ‘We want to come!’
PC Khan gave the name of the police station.
‘We’ll find it, Linda,’ said Michael, because it was obvious to everyone that Linda intended either to force her way into the police car or ride bumper-to-bumper after it.
‘It’ll be fine,’ Robin reassured her parents, pulling on her coat. ‘I’ll sort this out. Phone Strike,’ she added firmly to her father, before picking up her keys and following the police out of the flat.
