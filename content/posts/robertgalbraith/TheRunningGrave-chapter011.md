The Running Grave
11
Six in the fifth place…
Shock goes hither and thither…
However, nothing at all is lost.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Strike, who was eager to hear how Robin’s first trip to the temple had gone, didn’t receive her first few attempts to contact him because he was sitting on the Tube, with a carrier bag from Hamleys on his lap. Robin’s fifth attempt to contact him finally came through when he’d left the train at Bromley South, and was on the point of pressing her number.
‘Sorry,’ was his first word. ‘Didn’t have reception. I’m on my way to Lucy’s.’
Lucy was the half-sister with whom Strike had grown up, because she was his mother’s child, rather than his father’s. While he loved Lucy, they had very little in common, and outsiders tended to express disbelief that they were related at all, given that Lucy was small and blonde. Strike was undertaking today’s visit out of a sense of duty, not pleasure, and was anticipating a difficult couple of hours.
‘How was it?’ he asked, setting off along the road under a sky that was threatening rain.
‘Not what I expected,’ admitted Robin, who’d walked several blocks away from the temple before finding a café with seats outside where, due to the chilliness of the day, she had no eavesdroppers. ‘I thought it’d be a bit more fire and brimstone, but not at all, it’s wall-to-wall social justice and being free to have doubts. Very slick, though – films shown on a cinema screen and David Bowie playing over the—’
‘Bowie?’
‘Yes, ‘Heroes’ – but the big news is that Papa J was there in person.’
‘Was he, now?’
‘He’s very charismatic.’
‘He’d need to be,’ grunted Strike. ‘Anyone try and recruit you?’
‘Not explicitly, but a blonde woman, who I think knows how much Prudence’s clothes must’ve cost, intercepted me on the way out. Said she hoped I’d enjoyed myself and asked whether I had any questions. I said it had all been very interesting, but I didn’t show massive interest. She said she hoped she’d see me there again.’
‘Playing hard to get,’ said Strike, who’d just felt the first spot of icy rain on his face. ‘Good call.’
‘I had to bung a twenty pound note into the collecting bucket on the way out,’ said Robin, ‘given that I’m carrying a five hundred quid handbag. I made sure the boy on the door saw how much I was giving, though.’
‘Take it out of our petty cash,’ said Strike.
‘And I – wow,’ said Robin, half-laughing, half-startled.
‘What’s the matter?’
‘I – nothing.’
Two young American men – tall, well-nourished, bearded and baseball-capped – had just taken a table two away from Robin. One was wearing a polo shirt, the other, a NASCAR T-shirt emblazoned with the name Jimmie Jones, and a large 48.
‘Nothing important, I’ll tell you later,’ said Robin. ‘Just wanted to touch base. I’ll let you go, if you’re off to Lucy’s. See you Monday.’
Strike, who didn’t particularly want to forfeit the distraction of talking to Robin while he headed towards an encounter he was dreading, said goodbye, then continued walking, his feeling of foreboding growing ever deeper. Lucy had sounded thrilled that he was coming over, which made the prospect of delivering his news even less palatable.
The large magnolia tree in Lucy and Greg’s front garden was, naturally, sporting no flowers on this cool March day. Strike knocked on the door, which was opened almost immediately by his favourite nephew, Jack.
‘Bloody hell,’ said Strike. ‘You’ve grown about eight inches since I last saw you.’
‘Be weird if I’d shrunk,’ said Jack, grinning. ‘You’re thinner.’
‘Yeah, well, I needed shrinking,’ said Strike, wiping his feet on the doormat. ‘You’ll understand once you reach my age… I got those for you, Luke and Adam,’ he added, handing Jack the carrier bag.
Lucy now appeared in the hall, and on hearing these words, beamed at Strike. She’d previously expressed displeasure that he so obviously favoured her middle son.
‘This is a lovely surprise,’ she said, hugging her brother. ‘Luke’s out at football with Greg, but Adam’s upstairs. Come through, I’ve just taken banana bread out of the oven.’
‘Smells great,’ said Strike, following her into the kitchen, with its glass doors overlooking a lawn. ‘Give me a small bit. I’m still a stone off my target weight.’
‘I’m so glad you called, because I’m a bit worried about Ted,’ said Lucy, taking a couple of small plates out of the cupboard. Ted was their widowed uncle, who lived in Cornwall. ‘I rang him this morning and he told me the same story he told me last time I called, word for word.’
‘Think he’s lonely,’ said Strike, sitting down at the kitchen table.
‘Maybe,’ said Lucy doubtfully, ‘but I’ve been thinking I might nip down and see him. Would you come, too?’
‘Yeah, with a bit of notice,’ said Strike, who was experiencing the familiar sense of constriction Lucy often gave him, whereby he was asked to commit immediately to future arrangements, and often had to deal with her irritability when he couldn’t instantly fall in with her plans. Today, however, Lucy merely set a slice of banana bread down in front of him, followed shortly afterwards by a mug of tea.
‘So, why the visit? Not that I’m not pleased to see you.’
Before Strike could respond, both Jack and Adam appeared, each holding an Air Storm Firetek Bow, which had been bought by Strike with the express purpose of getting Lucy’s sons out into the garden while he talked to her.
‘This is awesome,’ said Adam to Strike.
‘Glad you like it,’ said Strike.
‘Corm, you shouldn’t have!’ said Lucy, clearly delighted that he had. Given the number of times he’d forgotten his nephews’ birthdays, Strike was well aware these gifts might be said to be overdue. ‘Pity it’s raining,’ said Lucy, glancing out of the window at the garden.
‘Not much,’ said Strike.
‘I want to try it,’ said Jack, confirming his position as his uncle’s favourite. ‘I’ll put on my wellies,’ he threw at his mother, as he hurried out of the kitchen again. To Strike’s relief, Adam followed his older brother.
‘So, why are you here?’ Lucy asked again.
‘I’d rather talk once the boys can’t hear us,’ said Strike.
‘Oh my God – are you ill?’ said Lucy, in panic.
‘No, of course not,’ said Strike. ‘I just—’
Jack and Adam came hurrying back into the kitchen, both carrying wellington boots.
‘And coats, boys,’ said Lucy, torn now between apprehension at what Strike was about to tell her, and the needs of her sons.
At last, when the two boys disappeared into the rain with their coats on, Strike cleared his throat.
‘OK, I wanted to talk to you about a case I’ve just taken on.’
‘Oh,’ said Lucy, who looked slightly reassured. ‘Why?’
‘Because if we’re successful, which is long odds at the moment, but if we are, there’s a chance it’ll be in the press. And if that happens, there’s also a slim chance that there’ll be something about us – you and me – in there. That something might be dug up.’
‘Like what?’ said Lucy, in a slightly brittle voice. ‘They’ve done it all already, haven’t they? “Son of super-groupie.” “Notorious good-time girl Leda Strike.”’
‘This wouldn’t just be about Mum,’ said Strike.
He noticed Lucy’s slight tightening of expression. She hadn’t called Leda ‘Mum’ since she was fourteen and was explicit, these days, about the fact that she’d considered their late aunt, Joan, her true mother.
‘What, then?’ said Lucy.
‘Well,’ said Strike, ‘I’ve been hired to investigate the Universal Humanitarian Church.’
‘So?’
‘So, their headquarters are where the Aylmerton Community used to be.’
Lucy slumped back in her chair as though the words had hit her physically, her expression blank. At last, she swallowed and said,
‘Oh.’
‘I got a hell of a shock when I realised that’s where they started,’ said Strike. ‘I only found out once we’d taken the case and—’
To his horror, Lucy had begun noiselessly crying.
‘Luce,’ he said, putting out a hand, but she’d withdrawn her own from the table, and now wrapped her arms around herself. This was a far worse reaction than Strike had imagined; he’d anticipated anger and resentment that he was once again exposing her to gossip at the school gates about her unorthodox past.
‘Christ,’ said Strike, ‘I didn’t—’
‘Didn’t what?’ said Lucy, with a trace of anger, tears now trickling down her face.
‘I’m sorry,’ said Strike. ‘I got a shock myself, when I saw—’
Lucy got to her feet and blundered towards the side where kitchen roll stood on a metal stand. Ripping off several pieces she mopped her face, took a deep breath and said, clearly fighting to regain control,
‘I’m sorry. I just – I didn’t expect—’
She broke down completely. Strike pushed himself up from the table and walked towards her. He half-expected her to push him away, but she let him put his arms around her and pull her close, so that she was sobbing into her brother’s chest. They’d stood thus for barely a minute when the front door opened.
Lucy pushed Strike away at once, hastily wiping her face. With false gaiety she called out,
‘How did it go, Luke, did you win?’
‘Yeah,’ called Luke back from the hall, and Strike noticed that his voice had broken since he’d last seen the boy. ‘Three–one. They were pathetic.’
‘Fantastic! If you’re muddy, get straight in the shower,’ called Lucy. ‘Uncle Corm’s here,’ she added.
Luke made no response to this, but ran straight upstairs.
Strike’s brother-in-law now entered the kitchen, his tracksuit bottoms damp. Strike supposed he must coach or manage his son’s team. Greg was a quantity surveyor for whom Strike entertained feelings that had never quite reached the level of liking.
‘Everything all right?’ he said, looking from Strike to Lucy.
‘Just been talking about Ted,’ said Lucy, to explain her reddened eyes and heightened colour.
‘Oh. Well, I’ve been telling her, it’s only natural he’s getting a bit forgetful,’ Greg told Strike dismissively. ‘What’s he now, eighty-odd?’
‘Seventy-nine,’ said Lucy.
‘Well, that’s eighty-odd, isn’t it?’ said Greg, heading for the loaf of banana bread.
‘Come through to the living room,’ Lucy told Strike, picking up her tea. ‘We can talk it all over there.’
Greg, who evidently had no desire to talk about his uncle-in-law’s well-being, made no objection at being excluded from the conversation.
The living room, with its beige three-piece suite, was unchanged since the last time Strike had been in there, except that his nephews’ school photos had been updated. A large picture of Uncle Ted and Aunt Joan, dating from the eighties, stood in pride of place on a shelf. Strike well remembered the couple looking like that: Joan’s hair as big as Elnett could make it, stiff in the sea breezes, Ted, the largest and strongest member of the local lifeboat men. As Strike sat down on the sofa, he felt as though he should turn the picture to face the wall before dragging up memories of the Aylmerton Community, because his aunt and uncle had dedicated so much of their lives to trying to protect the niece and nephew whom Leda dumped on them, then removed, as unpredictably as she did everything.
Having shut the door carefully on the rest of her family, Lucy sat down in an armchair and placed her mug of tea on a side table.
‘I’m sorry,’ she said again.
‘Don’t apologise,’ said Strike. ‘Believe me, I know.’
‘Do you?’ she said, with an odd note in her voice.
‘It was a fucking terrible place,’ said Strike. ‘Don’t think I’ve forgotten.’
‘Are any of the people who were at the Aylmerton Community still there?’
‘Only one, as far as I know,’ said Strike. ‘She claims to have been a victim of the Crowthers. She’s married to the church’s leader.’
‘What’s her name?’
‘Mazu,’ said Strike.
‘Oh God,’ said Lucy, and she covered her face with her hands again.
Horrible suspicions were now assailing Strike. He’d believed nothing more serious than feeling scared and sometimes hungry had happened to either of them at the Aylmerton Community; that they’d narrowly escaped what had later been all over the press. In his memory, he’d always been with Lucy, sticking close, trying to make sure she wasn’t invited anywhere by either of the Crowther brothers. From their adjoining mattresses on the floor, brother and sister had whispered at night about how much they hated the place, about how much they wished Leda would take them away. That was all that had happened, surely? That was what he’d believed, for years.
‘Luce?’ he said.
‘Don’t you remember her?’ said Lucy savagely, dropping her hands. ‘Don’t you remember that girl?’
‘No,’ said Strike truthfully.
His memory was usually excellent, but Aylmerton was a blur to him, more feeling than fact, an ominous black memory hole. Perhaps he’d deliberately tried to forget individuals: better by far to consign the whole lot to a faceless slough that need never be waded through, now it was all over.
‘You do. Very pale. Pointed nose. Black hair. Always wearing kind of tarty clothes.’
Something shifted in Strike’s memory. He saw a pair of very brief shorts, a thin halter-neck top and straggly, dark, slightly greasy hair. He’d been twelve: his hormones hadn’t yet reached the adolescent peak at which the slightest sign of unsupported breasts caused uncontainable, sometimes mortifyingly visible, excitement.
‘Yeah, that rings a bell,’ he said.
‘So she’s still there?’ said Lucy, now breathing fast. ‘At the farm?’
‘Yeah. As I say, she married—’
‘If she was a victim,’ said Lucy, through clenched teeth, ‘she sure as hell spread it around.’
‘Why d’you say that?’ said Strike.
‘Because she – because she—’
Lucy was shaking. For a couple of seconds she said nothing, then a torrent of words exploded from her.
‘D’you know how glad I was, knowing I was having a boy, every single time they scanned me? Every single time. I didn’t want a girl. I knew I’d’ve been a lousy mother to a girl.’
‘You’d’ve been—’
‘No, I wouldn’t,’ said Lucy fiercely. ‘I’d have barely let her out of my sight! I know it happens to boys too, I know it does, but the odds – the odds – it was only the girls at Aylmerton. Only the girls.’
Lucy continued to breathe very hard, intermittently dabbing her eyes with kitchen roll. Strike knew it was cowardice, because he could tell Lucy needed to tell him, but he didn’t want to ask any more questions, because he didn’t want to hear the answers.
‘She took me to him,’ said Lucy at last.
‘To who?’
‘Dr Coates,’ said Lucy. ‘I fell over. She must’ve been fifteen, sixteen. She had me by the hand. I didn’t want to go. “You should see the doctor.” She was half-dragging me.’
Another brief silence unrolled through the room, but Strike could feel Lucy’s rage battling with her habitual reserve and her determination to pretend that the life to which Leda had subjected them was as long dead as Leda herself.
‘Did he,’ said Strike slowly, ‘touch—’
‘He pushed four fingers inside me,’ said Lucy brutally. ‘I bled for two days.’
‘Oh fuck,’ said Strike, wiping his face with his hand. ‘Where was I?’
‘Playing football,’ said Lucy. ‘I was playing, as well. That’s how I fell. You probably thought she was helping me.’
‘Shit, Luce,’ said Strike. ‘I’m so—’
‘It’s not your fault, it’s my so-called mother’s fault,’ spat Lucy. ‘Where was she? Getting stoned somewhere? Screwing some long-haired weirdo in the woods? And that bitch Mazu shut me in with Coates, and she knew. She knew. And I saw her doing it to other little girls. Taking them to the Crowthers’ rooms. That’s what I talk about most in therapy, why I didn’t tell anyone, why I didn’t stop other little girls getting hurt—’
‘You’re in therapy?’ blurted out Strike.
‘Christ Almighty, of course I’m in therapy!’ said Lucy, in a furious whisper, as somebody, probably Greg, now full of banana cake, walked past the sitting room door and headed upstairs. ‘After that bloody childhood – aren’t you?’
‘No,’ said Strike.
‘No,’ repeated Lucy bitterly, ‘you don’t need it, of course, so self-sufficient, so un-messed-up—’
‘I’m not saying that,’ said Strike. ‘I’m not – bloody hell—’
‘Don’t,’ she snapped, arms wrapped around her torso again. ‘I don’t want – never mind, it doesn’t matter. Except it does matter,’ she said, tears trickling down her face again, ‘I can’t forgive myself for not speaking up. There were other little girls being led away by that Mazu bitch, and I never said anything, because I didn’t want to say what had happened to m—’
The sitting room door opened. Strike was astonished by the abrupt change in Lucy, as she wiped her face dry and straightened her back in an instant, so that when Jack entered, panting and wet-haired, she was smiling.
‘These are great,’ Jack told Strike, beaming, as he held up his bow.
‘Glad to hear it,’ said Strike.
‘Jack, go dry yourself off and then you can have some banana bread,’ said Lucy, for all the world as though she were perfectly happy, and for the very first time in their adult lives, it occurred to Strike that his sister’s determination to cling to stability and her notion of normality, her iron-clad refusal to dwell endlessly on the awful possibilities of human behaviour, was a form of extraordinary courage.
Once the door had closed on Jack, he turned back to Lucy, and said quietly, and almost sincerely,
‘I wish you’d told me this before.’
‘It would’ve upset you. Anyway, you’ve always wanted to believe Leda was wonderful.’
‘I haven’t,’ he said, now being completely honest. ‘She was… what she was.’
‘She wasn’t fit to be a mother,’ said Lucy angrily.
‘No,’ said Strike heavily. ‘I think you’re probably right, there.’
Lucy stared at him for a few seconds in blank astonishment.
‘I’ve waited years to hear you say that. Years.’
‘I know you have,’ said Strike. ‘Look, I know you think I think she was perfect, but of course I bloody don’t. D’you think I look at the kind of mother you are, and remember what she was, and can’t see the difference?’
‘Oh Stick,’ said Lucy tearfully.
‘She was what she was,’ repeated Strike. ‘I loved her, I can’t sit here and say I didn’t. And she might’ve been a fucking nightmare in loads of ways, but I know she loved us, too.’
‘Did she?’ said Lucy, wiping her eyes with kitchen roll.
‘You know she did,’ said Strike. ‘She didn’t keep us safe, because she was so bloody naive she was barely fit to open a front door on her own. She fucked up our schooling because she hated school herself. She dragged fucking terrible men into our lives because she always thought this one was going to be the love of her life. None of it was malicious, it was just bloody careless.’
‘Careless people do a lot of damage,’ said Lucy, still drying her tears.
‘Yeah, they do,’ said Strike. ‘And she did. Mostly to herself, in the end.’
‘I didn’t – I didn’t want her to die,’ sobbed Lucy.
‘Jesus, Luce, I know you didn’t!’
‘I always thought one day I’d have it all out with her – and then it was too late, and she was g-gone… and you say she loved us, but—’
‘You know she did,’ said Strike. ‘You do, Luce. Remember that serial story she used to make up for us? What the fuck was it called?’
‘The Moonbeams,’ said Lucy, still sobbing.
‘The Moonbeam family,’ said Strike. ‘With Mummy Moonbeam and…’
‘… Bombo and Mungo…’
‘She didn’t show love like most mothers,’ said Strike, ‘but she didn’t do anything like other people. Doesn’t mean love wasn’t there. Doesn’t mean she wasn’t fucking irresponsible, either.’
For a couple of minutes there was silence again, but for Lucy’s steadily decreasing sniffs. At last, she wiped her face with both of hands and looked up, eyes red.
‘If you’re investigating that so-called church – what’s it called?’
‘The UHC.’
‘Just make sure you get that bitch Mazu,’ said Lucy in a low voice. ‘I don’t care if she was abused herself. I’m sorry, I don’t. She enabled them to do it to other girls. She was pimping for them.’
Strike considered telling her that getting Mazu wasn’t what he’d been hired to do, but instead said,
‘If I get the opportunity, I definitely will.’
‘Thank you,’ mumbled Lucy, still wiping her puffy eyes. ‘Then it’d be worth you taking the job.’
‘Listen, there was something else I wanted to tell you,’ he said, wondering, even as he heard himself say it, what the hell he was playing at. The impulse came, in a confused way, from a desire to be honest, as she’d been honest, to stop hiding from her. ‘I – er – I’ve made contact with Prudence. You know – Rokeby’s other illegitimate.’
‘Have you?’ said Lucy, and to his amazement – he’d hidden the burgeoning relationship from her out of fear that she’d feel jealous, or that she was being replaced – she was smiling through her tears. ‘Stick, that’s great!’
‘Is it?’ he said, thrown.
‘Well, of course it is!’ she said. ‘How long have you two been in touch?’
‘Dunno. A few months. She visited me in hospital when I – you know—’
He gestured with his thumb towards the lung that had been punctured by a cornered killer.
‘What’s she like?’ said Lucy, who appeared curious and interested, but in no way resentful.
‘Nice,’ said Strike. ‘I mean, she’s not you—’
‘You don’t need to say that,’ said Lucy, with a shaky laugh. ‘I know what we went through together, I know nobody else will ever understand that. You know, Joan always wanted you to make it up with Rokeby.’
‘Prudence isn’t Rokeby,’ said Strike.
‘I know,’ said Lucy, ‘but it’s still good you’re seeing her. Joan would be happy.’
‘I didn’t think you’d take it like this.’
‘Why not? I see my dad’s other kids.’
‘Do you?’
‘Of course I do! I didn’t want to go on about it, because—’
‘You thought I’d be hurt?’
‘Probably because I felt guilty that I’ve got a relationship with my dad and half-siblings, and you haven’t,’ said Lucy.
After a short pause, she said,
‘I saw Charlotte in the paper, with her new boyfriend.’
‘Yeah,’ said Strike, ‘well, she likes a certain lifestyle. That was always a problem, me being broke.’
‘You don’t wish—?’
‘Christ, no,’ said Strike. ‘That’s dead and buried.’
‘I’m glad,’ said Lucy. ‘I’m really glad. You deserve so much better. You’ll stay for lunch, won’t you?’
Given the revelations of the morning, Strike felt he had no choice but to agree.
