The Cuckoo's Calling
Why were you born when the snow was falling?You should have come to the cuckoo’s calling,Or when grapes are green in the cluster,Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster     For their far off flying     From summer dying. Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?You should have died at the apples’ dropping,When the grasshopper comes to trouble,And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,     And all winds go sighing     For sweet things dying.Christina G. Rossetti, “A Dirge”
