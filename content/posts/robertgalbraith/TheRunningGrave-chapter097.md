The Running Grave
97
K’an represents the pig slaughtered in the small sacrifice.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
They’d been sitting in the Land Rover, which was parked a few doors down from Carrie Curtis Woods’ still empty house, for forty minutes when a silver Kia Picanto passed them.
‘Strike,’ said Robin, having caught a glimpse of a blonde female driver.
The car turned into the Woods family’s drive. The driver got out. She had short, blonde, curly hair, and was wearing a pair of unflatteringly tight jeans, which caused a roll of fat under her white T-shirt to spill over the waistband. She was tanned, wore a lot of spiky mascara, and her eyebrows were thinner than was currently fashionable, giving her a surprised look. A polyester shopper was slung over her shoulder.
‘Let’s go,’ said Strike.
Carrie Curtis Woods was halfway to her front door when she heard the footsteps behind her and turned, keys in hand.
‘Afternoon,’ said Strike. ‘My name’s Cormoran Strike and this is Robin Ellacott. We’re private detectives. We believe you lived at Chapman Farm in the mid-nineties, under the name Cherie Gittins? We’d like to ask you some questions, if that’s all right.’
Twice before, while working at the agency, Robin had thought a female interviewee might faint. Carrie’s face lost all healthy colour, leaving the surface tan patchy and yellow and her lips pale. Robin braced, ready to run forwards and break the woman’s fall onto hard concrete.
‘We just want to hear your side of the story, Carrie,’ said Strike.
The woman’s eyes darted to the opposite neighbour’s windows, and back to Strike. He was interested in the fact that she wasn’t asking them to repeat their names, as people often did, whether out of confusion, or to play for time. He had the feeling their appearance wasn’t entirely a surprise, that she’d been dreading something of this kind. Perhaps the UHC had a Facebook page, and she’d seen attacks on him and Robin there, or perhaps she’d been dreading this reckoning for years.
The seconds ticked past and Carrie remained frozen, and it was already too late to credibly deny that she didn’t know what they were talking about, or that she’d ever been Cherie Gittins.
‘All righ’,’ she said at last, her voice barely audible.
She turned and walked towards the front door. Strike and Robin followed.
The interior of the small house smelled of Pledge. The only thing out of place in the hall was a small, pink doll’s pushchair, which Carrie moved aside so that Strike and Robin could enter the combination sitting and dining room, which had pale blue wallpaper and a blue three-piece suite bearing stripy mauve cushions, all of which were balanced on their points.
Enlarged family photographs in pewter-coloured frames covered the wall behind the sofa. Carrie Curtis Woods’ two little girls, familiar to Strike from his perusal of her Facebook page, were pictured over and over again, sometimes with one or other of their parents. Both daughters were blonde, dimpled and always beaming. The younger child had several missing teeth.
‘Your daughters are lovely,’ said Robin, turning to smile at Carrie. ‘They’re not here?’
‘No,’ said Carrie, in a croak.
‘Play date?’ asked Robin, who was trying to quieten the woman’s nerves.
‘No. I jus’ took them over to their nana’s. They wan’ed to give her the presents they got her, in Spain. We’ve been on holiday.’
There was barely a trace of London in her voice now: she spoke with a Bristol drawl, the vowels elongated, consonants at the end of words cut off. She dropped into an armchair, setting her shopper onto the floor beside her feet.
‘You can siddown,’ she said weakly. Strike and Robin did so, on the sofa.
‘How long have you lived in Thornbury, Carrie?’ Robin asked.
‘Ten – ’leven years?’
‘What made you move here?’
‘I met my husband,’ she said. ‘Nate.’
‘Right,’ said Robin, smiling.
‘He wuz on a stag weekend. I wuz workin’ in the pub when they all come in.’
‘Ah.’
‘So I moved, ’cause he lived here.’
Further small talk revealed that Carrie had moved to Thornbury a mere two weeks after meeting Nathan in Manchester. She’d got herself a waitressing job in Thornbury, she and Nate had found themselves a rented flat, and married just ten months later.
The speed with which she’d relocated to be with a man she’d only just met and her chameleon-like transformation into what might have been a Thornbury native made Strike think Carrie was of a type he’d met before. Such people clung to more dominant personalities, training themselves like mistletoe on a tree, absorbing their opinions, their mannerisms and mirroring their style. Carrie, who’d once ringed her eyes in black liner before driving her knife-toting boyfriend to rob a pharmacy and stab an innocent bystander, was now telling Robin in her adopted accent that the local schools were very good and talked with something like reverence about her husband: what long hours he worked, and how he had no truck with people who didn’t, because he was like that, he’d always been a grafter. Her nerves seemed to dissipate slightly during the banal conversation. She seemed glad of the opportunity to set out the little stall of her life for the detectives’ consideration. Whatever she’d once been, she was blameless now.
‘So,’ said Strike, when a convenient pause presented itself, ‘we’d like to ask you a few questions, if that’s all right. We’ve been hired to look into the Universal Humanitarian Church and we’re particularly interested in what happened to Daiyu Wace.’
Carrie gave a little twitch, as though some invisible entity had tugged her strings.
‘We hoped you might be able to fill in a few details about her,’ said Strike.
‘All righ’,’ said Carrie.
‘Is it all right if I take notes?’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie, watching Strike draw out his pen.
‘You confirm you’re the woman who was living at Chapman Farm in 1995, under the name Cherie Gittins?’
Carrie nodded.
‘When did you first join the church?’ asked Robin.
‘Ninety… three,’ she said. ‘I think. Yeah, ninety-three.’
‘What made you join?’
‘I wen’ along to a meetin’. In London.’
‘What attracted you to the UHC?’ asked Strike.
‘Nothin’,’ said Carrie baldly. ‘The buildin’ wuz warm, tha’s all. I’d run off… run away from home. I wuz sleepin’ in a hostel… I didn’t get on with my mum. She drank. She had a new boyfriend and… yeah.’
‘How soon after that meeting did you go to Chapman Farm?’ asked Strike.
‘I wen’ right after the meetin’ finished… they had a minibus outside.’
Her hands were clutching each other, the knuckles white. There was a henna tattoo drawn onto the back of one of them, doubtless done in Spain. Perhaps, Robin thought, her small daughters had also had flowers and curlicues drawn onto their hands.
‘What did you think of Chapman Farm, when you got there?’ asked Strike.
There was a long pause.
‘Well, it wuz… weird, wuzn’ it?’
‘Weird?’
‘Yeah… I liked some of it though. I liked bein’ with the kids.’
‘They liked you, too,’ said Robin. ‘I’ve heard some very nice things about you from a woman called Emily. She’d have been around seven or eight when you knew her. D’you remember her? Emily Pirbright?’
‘Emily?’ said Carrie distractedly. ‘Um – maybe. I’m not sure.’
‘She had a sister, Becca.’
‘Oh… yeah,’ said Carrie. ‘Have you – where’s Becca, now?’
‘Still in the church,’ said Robin. ‘Both sisters are. Emily told me she really loved you – that both of them did. She said all the kids felt that way about you.’
Carrie’s mouth made a tragi-comic downwards arc and she began to cry, noisily.
‘I didn’t mean to upset you,’ said Robin hastily, as Carrie bent down to the shopper at her feet and extracted a packet of tissues from its interior. She mopped her eyes and blew her nose, saying through her sobs,
‘Sorry, sorry…’
‘No problem,’ said Strike. ‘We understand this must be difficult.’
‘Can I get you anything, Carrie?’ said Robin. ‘A glass of water?’
‘Y–y–yes please,’ wept Carrie.
Robin left the room for the kitchen, which lay off the dining area. Strike let Carrie cry without offering words of comfort. He judged her distress to be genuine, but it would set a bad precedent to make her think tears were the way to soften up her interviewers.
Robin, who was filling a glass with tap water in the small but spotless kitchen, noticed Carrie’s daughters’ paintings on the fridge door, all of which were signed either Poppy or Daisy. One was captioned Me and Mummy and showed two blonde figures hand in hand, both wearing princess dresses and crowns.
‘Thank you,’ whispered Carrie when Robin returned to the sitting room and handed her the glass. She took a sip, then looked up at Strike again.
‘OK to continue?’ he asked formally. Carrie nodded, her eyes now reddened and swollen, the mascara washed away onto her cheeks, leaving them grey. Strike thought she looked like a piglet, but Robin was reminded of the teenaged girls keeping vigil before the Manifestation of the Drowned Prophet.
‘So you met Daiyu for the first time at the farm?’ asked Strike.
Carrie nodded.
‘What did you think of her?’
‘Thought she wuz lovely,’ said Carrie.
‘Really? Because a few people have told us she was spoiled.’
‘Well… maybe a bit. She wuz still sweet.’
‘We’ve heard you spent a lot of time with her.’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie, after another brief pause, ‘I s’pose I did.’
‘Emily told me,’ said Robin, ‘that Daiyu used to boast you and she were going to go away and set up house together. Is that true?’
‘No!’ said Carrie, sounding shocked.
‘Daiyu made that up, did she?’ said Strike.
‘If – if she said it, yeah.’
‘Why d’you think she’d claim she was going to leave to live with you?’
‘I dunno.’
‘Maybe to make the other children jealous?’ suggested Robin.
‘Maybe,’ agreed Carrie, ‘yeah.’
‘How did you like the Waces?’ asked Strike.
‘I… thought the same as everyone else.’
‘What d’you mean by that?’
‘Well, they wuz… they could be strict,’ said Carrie, ‘but it wuz for a good cause, I s’pose.’
‘You thought that, did you?’ said Strike. ‘That the church’s cause was good?’
‘It did good things. Some good things.’
‘Did you have any particular friends at Chapman Farm?’
‘No,’ said Carrie. ‘You weren’ supposed to have special friends.’
She was holding her water tightly. Its surface was shivering.
‘All right, let’s talk about the morning you took Daiyu to Cromer,’ said Strike. ‘How did that come about?’
Carrie cleared her throat.
‘She jus’ wan’ed to go with me to the beach.’
‘Had you ever taken any other children to the beach?’
‘No.’
‘But you said yes to Daiyu?’
‘Yeah.’
‘Why?’
‘Well – ’cause she wan’ed to go, and – she kept goin’ on about it – so I agreed.’
‘Weren’t you worried about what her parents would say?’ asked Robin.
‘A bit,’ said Carrie, ‘but I thought we’d get back before they wuz awake.’
‘Walk us through what happened,’ said Strike. ‘How did you wake yourself up so early? There aren’t clocks at Chapman Farm, are there?’
Cherie looked unhappy that he knew this, and he was reminded of Jordan Reaney’s clear displeasure that Strike had so much information.
‘If you wuz on the vegetable run, they gave you a little clock to wake yourself.’
‘You were sleeping in the children’s dormitory the night before the trip to the beach, right?’
‘Yeah,’ she said uneasily, ‘I wuz on child duty.’
‘And who was going to be looking after the kids, once you’d left on the vegetable run?’
After yet another pause, Carrie said,
‘Well… there’d still be someone there, after I’d gone. There wuz always two grown-ups or teenagers in with the children overnight.’
‘Who was the other person on duty that night?’
‘I… can’ remember.’
‘Are you sure someone else was there, Carrie?’ asked Robin. ‘Emily told me that there were usually two adults in the room, but that that night it was only you.’
‘She’s wrong,’ said Carrie. ‘There wuz always two.’
‘But you can’t remember who the other person was?’ said Strike.
Carrie shook her head.
‘So you were woken up by your alarm clock. Then what happened?’
‘Well, I – I woke Daiyu up, di’n’ I?’
‘Had Jordan Reaney been given an alarm clock, too?’
‘Wha’?’
‘He was supposed to be on the vegetable run, too, wasn’t he?’
Another pause.
‘He overslept.’
‘You wouldn’t have had room for Daiyu if he hadn’t overslept, would you?’
‘I can’ remember all the details now. I jus’ know I woke up Daiyu and we got dressed and went to the van.’
‘Did you have to load vegetables onto the truck?’ asked Strike.
‘No. Everythin’ was already in it. From the night before.’
‘So you and Daiyu got in, taking towels for your swim?’
‘Yeah.’
‘Can I ask something?’ said Robin. ‘Why was Daiyu wearing a dress, instead of a tracksuit, Carrie? Or didn’t church members wear tracksuits, in the nineties?’
‘No, we wore ’em… but she wan’ed to wear her dress.’
‘Were the other children allowed normal clothes?’ asked Strike.
‘No.’
‘Did Daiyu got special treatment, because she was the Waces’ child?’
‘I s’pose – a bit,’ said Carrie.
‘So you drove out of the farm. Did you pass anyone?’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie. ‘The people on early duty.’
‘Can you remember who they were?’
‘Yeah… what’s-his-name Kennett. And a bloke called Paul, and a girl called Abigail.’
‘Where did you go, after you’d left the farm?’
‘To the two grocers.’
‘What grocers?’
‘There wuz one in Aylmerton and one in Cromer we used to sell to.’
‘Did Daiyu get out of the van at either of the grocers?’
‘No.’
‘Why not?’
‘Well – why would she?’ said Carrie, and for the very first time, Strike heard a trace of defiance. ‘People came out from the shops to unload the boxes. I on’y got out to make sure they took what they’d ordered. She stayed in the van.’
‘Then what happened?’
‘We wen’ to the beach,’ said Carrie, her voice noticeably stronger now.
‘How did you get down to the beach?’
‘What d’you mean?’
‘Did you walk, run—?’
‘We walked. I carried Daiyu.’
‘Why?’
‘She wan’ed me to.’
‘Did anyone see this?’
‘Yeah… an old woman in the café.’
‘Did you see her watching you at the time?’
‘Yeah.’
‘Were you parked very near her café?’
‘No. We wuz a bit along.’
Strangely, Strike thought, she seemed more confident now they were discussing the events that were presumably among the most traumatic of her memories than she’d seemed talking about Chapman Farm.
‘What happened when you got to the beach?’
‘We got undressed.’
‘So you were intending to swim, rather than to paddle?’
‘No, jus’ to paddle.’
‘So why take off all your outer clothing?’
‘I didn’ want Daiyu gettin’ her dress soakin’ wet. I told her she’d be uncomfortable on the way back. Daiyu said she wouldn’ take off her dress if I didn’ take off my tracksuit, so I did.’
‘Then what happened?’
‘We wen’ into the sea,’ said Carrie. ‘We paddled a bit and she wanted to go deeper. I knew she would. She wuz like that.’
‘Like what?’
‘Brave,’ said Carrie. ‘Adventurous.’
These were exactly the words she’d used at the inquest, Strike remembered.
‘So she went in deeper?’
‘Yeah. An’ I wen’ after her. An’ then she sort of – launched herself forwards, like she wuz goin’ to swim, but I knew she couldn’. I called to her to come back. She wuz laughin’. Her feet could still touch the bottom. She wuz wadin’ out, tryin’ to get me to chase her. And then – she wuz gone. She just went under.’
‘And what did you do?’
‘Swam out to try an’ get her, obviously,’ said Carrie.
‘You’re a strong swimmer, right?’ said Strike. ‘You give lessons, don’t you?’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie.
‘Did you hit the rip current as well?’
‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘I got pulled into it, but I knew what to do. I got out, but I couldn’ get to Daiyu, an’ I couldn’ see ’er any more, so I wen’ back to the beach, to get the coastguard.’
‘Which is when you met the Heatons, walking their dog?’
‘Yeah, exactly,’ said Carrie.
‘And the coastguard went out, and the police came?’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie. Robin had the sense she relaxed slightly as she said it, as though she’d come to the end of an ordeal. Strike turned a page in the notebook in which he’d been writing.
‘Mrs Heaton says you ran off up the beach when the police came, and started poking at some seaweed.’
‘No, I didn’,’ said Carrie quickly.
‘She remembered that quite clearly.’
‘It didn’ happen,’ said Carrie, the defiance now pronounced.
‘So the police arrived,’ said Strike, ‘and walked you back up to the van, right?’
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie.
‘Then what happened?’
‘I can’ remember exactly,’ said Carrie, but she immediately contradicted herself. ‘They took me to the station and I told them what had happened and then they took me back to the farm.’
‘And informed Daiyu’s parents what had happened?’
‘On’y Mazu, because Papa J wuzn’ – no, he wuz there,’ she corrected herself, ‘he wuzn’ supposed to be, but he wuz. I saw Mazu first, but Papa J called me to see him after a bit, to talk to me.’
‘Jonathan Wace wasn’t supposed to be at the farm that morning?’ said Strike.
‘No. I mean, yeah, he wuz. I can’ remember. I thought he wuz goin’ away that mornin’, but he didn’ go. And I didn’ see him the moment I got back, so I thought he’d gone, but he wuz there. It’s a long time ago, now,’ she said. ‘It all gets jumbled up.’
‘Where was Wace supposed to be that morning?’
‘I don’ know, I can’ remember,’ said Carrie, a little desperately. ‘I made a mistake: he wuz there when I got back, I just didn’ see him. He wuz there,’ she repeated.
‘Were you punished, for taking Daiyu to the beach without permission?’ said Robin.
‘Yeah,’ said Carrie.
‘What punishment were you given?’ asked Robin.
‘I don’ wanna talk about that,’ said Carrie, her voice strained. ‘They wuz angry. They had every right to be. If somebody had taken one of my little—’
Carrie emitted something between a gasp and a cough and began to cry again. She rocked backwards and forwards, sobbing into her hands for a couple of minutes. When Robin silently mimed to Strike an offer of comfort to Carrie, Strike shook his head. Doubtless he’d be accused of heartlessness again on the return journey, but he wanted to hear Carrie’s own words, not her response to somebody else’s sympathy or ire.
‘I’ve regretted it all my life, all my life,’ Carrie sobbed, raising her swollen-eyed face, tears still coursing down her cheeks. ‘I felt like I didn’ deserve Poppy and Daisy, when I had ’em! I shouldn’ of agreed… why did I do it? Why? I’ve asked myself that over ’n’ over, but I swear I never wan’ed – I wuz young, I knew it wuz wrong, I never wan’ed it to happen, oh God, and then she wuz dead and it wuz real, it wuz real…’
‘What d’you mean by that?’ said Strike. ‘What d’you mean by “it was real”?’
‘It wuzn’ a joke, it wuzn’ pretend – when you’re young, you don’ think stuff like that happens – but it wuz real, she wuzn’ comin’ back…’
‘The inquest must have been difficult for you,’ said Strike.
‘Of course it wuz,’ said Carrie, her face wet, her breathing still laboured, but with a trace of anger.
‘Mr Heaton says you spoke to him outside, after it was over.’
‘I can’ remember that.’
‘He remembers. He particularly remembers you saying to him, “I could have stopped it.”’
‘I never said that.’
‘You’re denying saying “I could have stopped it” to Mr Heaton?’
‘Yeah. No. I don’… maybe I said somethin’ like, “I could’ve stopped her goin’ in so deep.” That’s wha’ I meant.’
‘So you remember saying it now?’
‘No, but if I said it… that’s what I meant.’
‘It’s just a strange form of words,’ said Strike. ‘“I could have stopped it”, rather than, “I could have stopped her.” Were you aware there was a custody battle going on for Daiyu, at the time you took her to the beach?’
‘No.’
‘You hadn’t heard any talk about the Graves family wanting Daiyu to go and live with them?’
‘I heard… I heard somethin’ about how there wuz people who wanted to take Daiyu off her mum.’
‘That’s the Graveses,’ said Strike.
‘Oh. I thought it wuz social workers,’ said Carrie, and she said a little wildly, ‘they have too much power.’
‘What makes you say that?’
‘A friend of mine’s fosterin’. She has a terrible time with the social workers. Power mad, some of them.’
‘Can we go back to the night before you and Daiyu went swimming?’ said Strike.
‘I’ve already told you everythin’. I’ve said it all.’
‘We’ve heard you gave the children special drinks that night.’
‘No, I didn’!’ said Carrie, now turning pink.
‘The Pirbright children remember differently.’
‘Well, they’re wrong! Maybe someone else gave ’em drinks and they’re confusin’ it with that night. I never gave them any.’
‘So you didn’t give the younger children anything that might have made them fall asleep more quickly?’
‘Of course not!’
‘Were there any medicines like that at the farm? Any sleeping pills or liquids?’
‘No, never. Stuff like tha’ wuzn’ allowed.’
‘Emily says she didn’t like her drink, and poured it away,’ said Robin. ‘And she told me that after everyone else was asleep, you helped Daiyu out of the dormitory window.’
‘That didn’ happen. That never happened. That’s a lie,’ said Carrie. ‘I never, never put her out of a window.’
She seemed far more distressed about this allegation than she’d been while discussing the drowning.
‘So Emily’s making that up?’
‘Or she dreamed it. She could of dreamed it.’
‘Emily says Daiyu did quite a bit of sneaking around at the farm,’ said Robin. ‘She claimed to be doing magic with older children in the woods and the barns.’
‘Well, I never saw her sneakin’ around.’
‘Emily also told me Daiyu sometimes had forbidden food and small toys, things the other children weren’t allowed. Did you get those for her?’
‘No, of course not! I couldn’ve done, even if I’d wan’ed. You weren’ allowed money. I never went to the shops. Nobody did. It wuzn’ allowed.’
A short silence followed these words. Carrie watched Strike taking his mobile out of his pocket. Colour was coming and going in her face, and the hand with the henna tattoo was now frantically twisting her wedding and engagement rings.
Strike had deliberately left the Polaroids of the naked youths in pig masks at the office today. Since Reaney had knocked them to the floor during his interview, Strike had rethought the advisability of handing these original pieces of evidence to angry or frightened interviewees.
‘I’d like you to look at these photos,’ he told Carrie. ‘There are six of them. You can swipe right to see the others.’
He stood up to hand his mobile to Carrie. She began to visibly shake again as she looked down at the screen.
‘We know the blonde is you,’ said Strike.
Carrie opened her mouth, but no sound came out at first. Then she whispered,
‘It’s not me.’
‘I’m afraid I don’t believe you,’ said Strike. ‘I think that’s you, and the man with the skull tattoo is Jordan Reaney—’
‘It’s not.’
‘Who is he, then?’
There was a long pause. Then Carrie whispered,
‘Joe.’
‘What’s his surname?’
‘I can’ remember.’
‘Was Joe still at the farm when you left it?’
She nodded.
‘And who’s the smaller man?’ (who in the second photograph was penetrating the blonde from behind).
‘Paul,’ whispered Carrie.
‘Paul Draper?’
She nodded again.
‘And the girl with the long hair?’
Another long pause.
‘Rose.’
‘What’s her surname?’
‘I can’ remember.’
‘What happened to her?’
‘I dunno.’
‘Who’s taking the pictures?’
Again, Carrie opened her mouth and closed it again.
‘Who’s taking the pictures?’ Strike repeated.
‘I dunno,’ she whispered again.
‘How can you not know?’
Carrie didn’t answer.
‘Was this a punishment?’ Strike asked.
Carrie’s head jerked again.
‘Is that a yes? Somebody forced you to do this?’
She nodded.
‘Carrie,’ said Robin, ‘was the person taking the pictures masked too?’
Carrie raised her head to stare at Robin. It looked as though the woman had vacated her body: Robin had never seen anybody who so resembled a somnambulist, every muscle in her face slack, her eyes blank.
Then, making both Carrie and Robin jump, a song began to play from inside the shopper at Carrie’s feet.
I like to party, mm-mm, everybody does
Make love and listen to the music
You’ve got to let yourself go-go, go-go, oh-oh…
Carrie bent down automatically, rummaged in the shopper, pulled out her mobile and answered it, cutting the song off.
‘Hi Nate,’ she whispered. ‘Yeah… no, I took them over to your mum’s… yeah… no, I’m fine. Can I call you back?… no, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’ll call you back.’
Having hung up, Carrie looked from Robin to Strike, then said, in a flat voice,
‘You need to go now. You need to go.’
‘All right,’ said Strike, who could tell there was no point trying to press her further. He pulled one of his business cards out of his wallet. ‘If there’s anything else you’d like to tell us, Mrs Woods—’
‘You need to go.’
‘If you wanted to tell us anything else about Daiyu’s death—’
‘You need to go,’ Carrie said, yet again.
‘I realise this is very difficult,’ said Strike, ‘but if you were made to do anything you now regret—’
‘GO!’ shouted Carrie Curtis Woods.
