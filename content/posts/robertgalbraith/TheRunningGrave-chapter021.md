The Running Grave
21
The danger of heaven lies in the fact that one cannot climb it… The effects of the time of danger are truly great.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
The village Strike and Robin entered the following morning, which lay an hour from London, had a sleepy English prettiness. As they drove past half-timbered buildings overlooking a village green, Strike, who’d accepted Robin’s offer to drive his BMW, looked out at the stone grey Norman tower of the parish church, and spotted a sign proclaiming that they were in Buckinghamshire’s best kept village.
‘None of this will come cheap,’ he commented, as they turned off the High Street into Bowstridge Lane.
‘We’re here,’ said Robin, coming to a halt beside a square, detached house of tawny brick. ‘We’re ten minutes early, should we wait or—?’
‘Wait,’ said Strike, who had no desire to hurry through the interview. The longer it took, the more likely Robin would want something to eat before returning to London. ‘You all packed and ready for tomorrow?’
‘I’ve put my waterproof coat and underwear in a holdall, if you can call that packing,’ said Robin.
What she didn’t tell Strike was that she’d realised for the first time yesterday that she wouldn’t be able to take contraceptive pills with her into Chapman Farm. Having checked the small print on the pamphlet she’d been given, they were specifically listed as banned medications. Nor was she about to tell Strike that she and Murphy had had something close to an argument the previous evening, when Murphy had announced that he’d taken the day off to spend it with her, as a surprise, and she’d told him she was driving off to Buckinghamshire with Strike.
Strike’s mobile rang. Caller ID was withheld.
‘Strike.’
‘Hi,’ said a female voice. ‘This is Abigail Glover.’
Strike mouthed ‘Jonathan Wace’s daughter’ at Robin before turning his mobile to speakerphone so that she could hear what was going on.
‘Ah, great,’ he said. ‘You got the message I left at the station?’
‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘Woss this about?’
‘About the Universal Humanitarian Church,’ said Strike.
Absolute silence followed these words.
‘Are you still there?’ asked Strike.
‘Yeah.’
‘I was wondering whether you might be willing to talk to me,’ said Strike.
More silence: Strike and Robin were looking at each other. At last a single monosyllable issued from the phone.
‘Why?’
‘I’m a private—’
‘I know ’oo you are.’
Unlike her father’s, Abigail’s accent was pure working-class London.
‘Well, I’m trying to investigate some claims made about the church.’
‘’Oose claims?’
‘A man called Kevin Pirbright,’ said Strike, ‘who’s now dead, unfortunately. Did he ever make contact with you? He was writing a book.’
There was another silence, the longest yet.
‘You working for a newspaper?’ she asked suspiciously.
‘No, for a private client. I wondered whether you’d be happy to talk to me. It can be off the record,’ Strike added.
Yet another lengthy silence followed.
‘Hello?’
‘I dunno,’ she said at last. ‘I’ll need to fink about it. I’ll call you back if I… I’ll call you later.’
The line went dead.
Robin, who realised she’d been holding her breath, exhaled.
‘Well… I can’t say I’m surprised. If I were Wace’s daughter, I wouldn’t want to be reminded of it, either.’
‘No,’ agreed Strike, ‘but she’d be very useful, if she was happy to talk… I left a message for Jordan Reaney’s wife yesterday, after you left, by the way. Tracked her down to her place of work. She’s a manicurist at a place called Kuti-cles with a K.’
He checked the time on the dashboard.
‘We should probably go in.’
When Strike pressed the doorbell they heard a dog barking, and when the door opened, a wire-haired fox terrier came flying out of the house so fast he flew right past Strike and Robin, skidded on the paved area in the front of the house, turned, ran back and began jumping up and down on its hind legs, barking hysterically.
‘Calm down, Basil!’ shouted Niamh. Robin was taken aback by her youth: she was in her mid-twenties, and for the second time lately, Robin found herself comparing her own flat to somebody else’s house. Niamh was short and plump, with shoulder-length black hair and very bright blue eyes, and was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt with a quotation by Charlotte Brontë printed on the front: I would always rather be happy than dignified.
‘Sorry,’ Niamh said to Strike and Robin, before saying, ‘Basil, for God’s sake,’ seizing the dog by its collar and dragging it back inside. ‘Come in. Sorry,’ she repeated over her shoulder, as she dragged the overexcited dog along the wooden floorboards towards a kitchen at the end of the hall, ‘we moved in last Sunday and he’s been hyper ever since… get out,’ she added, forcibly pushing the dog out into the garden through a back door, which she closed firmly on him.
The kitchen was farmhouse style, with a purple Aga and plates displayed on a dresser. A scrubbed wooden table was surrounded by purple-painted chairs, and the fridge door was covered in a child’s paintings, mostly blobs of paint and squiggles, which were held up with magnets. There was also – and this, Robin thought, explained how a twenty-five-year-old came to find herself living in such an expensive house – a picture of Niamh in a bikini, arm in arm with a man in swimming trunks, who looked at least forty. A smell of baking was making Strike salivate.
‘Thanks very much for seeing us, Mrs—’
‘Call me Niamh,’ said their hostess, who, now that she didn’t have a fox terrier to manage, looked nervous. ‘Please, sit down, I’ve just made biscuits.’
‘You’ve just moved in and you’re baking?’ said Robin, smiling.
‘Oh, I love baking, it calms me down,’ said Niamh, turning away to grab oven gloves. ‘Anyway, we’re pretty much straight now. I only took a couple of days off because I had leave owed to me.’
‘What d’you do for a living?’ asked Strike, who’d taken the chair nearest the back door, at which Basil was now whining and scratching, eager to get back in.
‘Accountant,’ said Niamh, now lifting cookies off the baking tray with a spatula. ‘Tea? Coffee?’
By the time the two detectives and Niamh had their mugs of tea, and the biscuits were sitting on a plate in the middle of the table, Basil’s whines had become so piteous that Niamh let him back into the room.
‘He’ll settle,’ she said, as the dog zoomed around the table, tail wagging furiously. ‘Eventually.’
Niamh sat down herself, making unnecessary adjustments to the sleeves of her sweatshirt.
‘Who’s the artwork by?’ Robin asked, pointing at the blobby creations on the fridge, and trying to put Niamh more at ease.
‘Oh, my little boy, Charlie,’ said Niamh. ‘He’s two. He’s with his dad this morning. Nigel thought it would be easier for me to talk to you without Charlie here.’
‘I take it that’s Nigel?’ asked Robin, smiling as she pointed at the beach picture.
‘Yes,’ said Niamh. She seemed to feel something needed explaining. ‘I met him at my first job. He was actually my boss.’
‘How lovely,’ said Robin, trying not to feel judgemental. Given Nigel’s hair loss, the couple looked more like father and daughter in the picture.
‘So,’ said Strike, ‘as I said on the phone, we’re after background on the Universal Humanitarian Church. Is it OK if I take notes?’
‘Yes, fine,’ said Niamh nervously.
‘Could we start with what year you and your family went to Chapman Farm?’ asked Strike, clicking out the nib of his pen.
‘1999,’ said Niamh.
‘And you were eight, right?’
‘Yes, and my brother Oisin was six and my sister Maeve was four.’
‘What made your parents join, do you know?’ asked Strike.
‘It was Dad, not Mum,’ said Niamh. ‘He was always a bit, um… it’s hard to describe. When we were little he was politically quite far left, but he’s about as far right as you can go these days. I actually haven’t spoken to him for three years… he just got worse and worse. Weird ranting phone calls, temper tantrums. Nigel thinks I’m better off without contact with him.’
‘Was your family religious?’ asked Strike.
‘Not before the UHC. No, I just remember Dad coming home one evening, incredibly excited, because he’d been to a meeting and got talking to Papa J, who converted him on the spot. It was like Dad had found the meaning of life. He was going on and on about a social revolution. He’d brought home a copy of Papa J’s book, The Answer. Mum just… went along with it,’ said Niamh sadly. ‘Maybe she thought everything would be better inside the church, I don’t know.
‘She told us it’d be fun. We cried about leaving home, and all our friends, she told us not to do it in front of Dad, because he’d be upset. Anything for an easy life, that was Mum… we hated it, though, from the moment we got there. No clothes of our own. No toys. I can remember Maeve sobbing for the cuddly bunny she used to take to bed every night. We’d taken it to the farm, but everything was locked up, the moment we arrived, including Maeve’s bunny.’
Niamh took a sip of tea, then said,
‘I don’t want to be hard on Mum. From what I can remember, she had a tough time with Dad’s mood swings and how erratic he was. She wasn’t very strong, either. She’d had some kind of heart condition since childhood. I remember her as very passive.’
‘Are you still in contact with her?’ asked Robin.
Niamh shook her head. Her eyes had become damp.
‘I haven’t seen her since we left her behind at Chapman Farm, in 2002. She stayed behind, with our younger sister. That’s actually part of the reason I said I’d see you,’ said Niamh. ‘I’d just like to know… if you happened to find out what happened to her… I wrote to the church a few years ago, trying to find out where she was, and I got a letter back saying she left in 2003. I don’t know whether it’s true. Maybe she couldn’t find us after we got out, because Dad took us to Whitby, where we’d never lived before, and he changed our surname. Maybe she didn’t want to find us, I don’t know, or possibly Dad told her to stay away. I think he might have heard from her, though, or from the UHC, after we left, because he got a few letters that made him really angry. Maybe they were forwarded from our old address. Anyway, he’d tear them up really small so we couldn’t read them. We were forbidden from ever mentioning Mum, after we left Chapman Farm.’
‘What made your father take you away, do you know?’ asked Strike.
‘I only know what he was saying as he dragged us out of there. It was night-time. We had to climb out over fences. We all wanted Mum to come with us – we were begging Dad to let us fetch her, and Maeve was calling for her, and Dad hit her. He told us Mum was a slut,’ said Niamh miserably, ‘which was just mad, because in the church, the women are supposed to… I mean, they’re shared, between all the men. But Dad must’ve thought Mum wasn’t joining in with all that, which just – it beggars belief, it really does, but it’s so typical of him. He thought he could join the church and just have the bits he liked, and leave the rest, which was idiotic: the church is completely anti-marriage. Everyone’s supposed to sleep around. From what I heard him telling our uncle afterwards, he didn’t believe Lin was his… I really hate saying all this, because from what I remember of Mum, she was quite – you know – prim. I don’t think she’d have wanted to sleep with people other than Dad. The whole thing’s so… so bizarre,’ said Niamh bleakly. ‘You can’t explain, to people who don’t understand about the UHC. I usually tell people my mum died when I was eleven. It’s just easier.’
‘I’m so sorry,’ said Robin, who really couldn’t think of anything else to say.
‘Oh, I’m all right,’ said Niamh, who no longer looked young, but far older than her years. ‘Compared to Oisin and Maeve, I’ve done fine. They’ve never got over the UHC. Maeve’s always at the doctor’s, constantly signed off sick from work, on tons of different medication. She binge eats, she’s got really big and she’s never had a stable relationship. And Oisin drinks far too much. He’s had kids with two different girls already, and he’s only twenty-three. He works really menial jobs, just to get drinking money. I’ve tried to help, to look after both of them a bit, because I’m the only one who made it through the whole thing kind of intact, and I’ve always felt guilty about that. Both of them are angry at me. “It’s all right for you, you married a rich old man.” But I coped better, right from the moment we got out. I could remember our pre-church life, so the change wasn’t such a shock. I caught up at school quicker than the other two and I’d had Mum around longer… but to this day, I can’t stand David Bowie. The UHC used to play “Heroes” all the time, to get people revved up. It doesn’t even have to be that song. Just the sound of his voice… when Bowie died, and they were playing his music non-stop on the radio, I hated it…’
‘Would you happen to have any photographs of your mother?’ Strike asked.
‘Yes, but they’re very old.’
‘Doesn’t matter. We’re just trying to tie names to faces at the moment.’
‘They’re upstairs,’ said Niamh. ‘Shall I—?’
‘If you wouldn’t mind,’ said Strike.
Niamh left the kitchen. Strike helped himself to a biscuit.
‘Bloody nice,’ he said, through a mouthful of chocolate chips.
‘Don’t give him any,’ said Robin, as Basil the dog placed his front paws on Strike’s leg. ‘Chocolate’s really bad for dogs.’
‘She says you can’t have any,’ Strike told the fox terrier, cramming the rest of the biscuit into his mouth. ‘It’s not my decision.’
They heard Niamh’s returning footsteps, and she reappeared.
‘That’s Mum,’ she said, passing a faded Polaroid to Strike.
He guessed it had been taken in the early nineties. Fair-haired Deirdre Doherty looked up at him, wearing a pair of square-framed glasses.
‘Thanks,’ said Strike, making a note. ‘Would you be all right with me taking a picture of this? I won’t take the original.’
Niamh nodded and Strike took a photograph on his mobile.
‘So you were at Chapman Farm for three years?’ Strike asked Niamh.
‘That’s right – not that I knew it until we got out, because there are no clocks or calendars in there.’
‘Really?’ said Robin, thinking of her Thursday night appointments with the plastic rock.
‘No, and they never celebrated birthdays or anything. I can remember walking through the woods and thinking, “Today could be my birthday. I don’t know.” But the people running the place must have known our dates of birth, because certain things happened when you reached different ages.’
‘What kind of things?’ asked Strike.
‘Well, up to the age of nine, you slept in a mixed dormitory. Then you went into a single-sex dormitory, and you had to start keeping a journal for the church elders to read. Obviously, you didn’t say what you were really thinking. I soon found out if I wrote one thing I’d learned and one thing I’d enjoyed, I’d be OK. “Today I learned more about what the false self is,”’ she said, adopting a flat voice, ‘“and ways of fighting my false self. I understand that the false self is the bad part of me that wants bad things. It is very important to defeat the false self. I enjoyed dinner tonight. We had chicken and rice and there were songs.”’
Beneath the table, Basil had finally settled down, his woolly head resting on Robin’s foot.
‘Then, when you turned thirteen, you moved into the adult dorms,’ Niamh continued, ‘and you started attending Manifestations and training to go pure spirit. The children who’d been raised in the church told me pure spirits get special powers. I remember fantasising at night that I’d go pure spirit really fast, and blast apart the walls of the dormitories and grab Mum, Oisin and Maeve and fly away with them… I don’t know whether I thought that was really possible… after you’d been in there a while, you did start to believe mad things.
‘But I can’t tell you how you go pure spirit,’ said Niamh, with a wry smile, ‘because I was only eleven when we left.’
‘So what was the routine, for younger kids?’ asked Strike.
‘Rote learning of church dogma, lots of colouring in, and sometimes going to the temple to chant,’ said Niamh. ‘It was incredibly boring and we were very heavily supervised. No proper teaching. Very occasionally we were allowed to go and play in the woods.
‘I remember this one day – ’ Niamh’s tone lightened a little, ‘– in the woods, Oisin and I found a hatchet. There was this big old tree with a hollow in it. If you climbed up high enough into its branches, you could see down into the hollow. One day Oisin got a long branch and started poking around inside the trunk, and he saw something at the bottom.
‘It was about that big,’ Niamh held her hands a foot apart, ‘and the blade was sort of rusty-looking. It’ll have been used for chopping wood, but Oisin was convinced it had blood on it. We couldn’t get it out, though. We couldn’t reach.
‘We didn’t tell anyone. You learned never to tell anyone anything, even if it was innocent, but we made up this whole story in secret about how Mazu had taken a naughty child into the woods and killed them there. We half-believed it, I think. We were all terrified of Mazu.’
‘You were?’ said Robin.
‘God, yes,’ said Niamh. ‘She was… like nobody I’ve ever met, before or since.’
‘In what way?’ asked Strike.
Niamh gave an unexpected shudder, then a half-ashamed laugh.
‘She… I always thought of her as, like, a really big spider. You don’t want to know what it might do to you, you just know you don’t want to be near it. That’s how I felt about Mazu.’
‘We’ve heard,’ said Strike, ‘that there were beatings and whippings.’
‘They kept the children away from anything like that,’ said Niamh, ‘but sometimes you’d see grown-ups with bruises or cuts. You learned never to ask about it.’
‘And we know one boy was tied to a tree in the dark overnight,’ said Robin.
‘Yes, that – that was quite a common punishment, for children, I think,’ said Niamh. ‘Kids weren’t supposed to talk about what had happened to them if they were taken away to be disciplined, but of course people whispered about it, in the dorms. I never got a bad punishment, personally,’ Niamh added. ‘I toed the line and I made sure Oisin and Maeve did, too. No, it wasn’t so much what actually happened to you, as what you were afraid might happen. There was always this feeling of lurking danger.
‘Mazu and Papa J could both do supernatural – I mean, obviously, they weren’t supernatural things, I know that now, but I believed it at the time. I thought they both had powers. Both of them could make objects move, just by pointing at them. I saw him levitate, as well. All the adults believed it was real, or they acted as if they did, so, of course, we did, too. But the worst thing for the children was the Drowned Prophet. You know about her?’
‘We know a bit,’ said Robin.
‘Mazu used to tell us stories about her. She was supposed to have been this perfect little girl who never did anything wrong and was marked for this important destiny. We were taught that she’d drowned on purpose, to prove that spirit is stronger than flesh, but that she came back to Chapman Farm in the white dress she drowned in, and appeared in the woods where she used to play – and we saw her,’ said Niamh quietly. ‘A couple of times at night I saw her, standing in the trees, staring towards our dormitory.’
Niamh shuddered.
‘I know it must have been a trick, but I had nightmares about it for years afterwards. I’d see her outside my bedroom window in Whitby, soaking wet in her white dress, with long black hair like Mazu’s, staring in at me, because we’d all been bad and left Chapman Farm. All the kids at Chapman Farm were petrified of the Drowned Prophet. “She’s listening. She’ll know if you’re lying. She’ll come and find you, in the dark.” That was enough to scare us all into good behaviour.’
‘I’m sure it was,’ said Robin.
Strike now reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a folded list.
‘Could I go through some names with you, and see whether you remember any of these people?’ he asked Niamh, who nodded. However, she showed no sign of recognition of the first half-dozen names Strike read out.
‘Sorry, it’s so long ago, and unless they were in our dormitory…’
The first name Niamh recognised was that of Kevin Pirbright, and Robin could tell from her reaction that she didn’t know he was dead.
‘Kevin Pirbright, yes! I remember him and his sister, Emily. They were nice. And they had an older sister, Becca, who came back not long after we’d arrived.’
‘What d’you mean, “came back”?’ asked Strike, his pen at the ready.
‘She’d been at the Birmingham centre for three years. She’d been kind of fast-tracked by Papa J, as a future church leader. She was really bossy. A big favourite of Papa J’s and Mazu’s. I didn’t like her much.’
Strike kept reading out names, but Niamh kept shaking her head until Strike said ‘Flora Brewster’.
‘Oh, yes, I think I remember her. She was a teenager, right? I helped her make her first corn dolly – they make them a lot, at Chapman Farm, to sell in Norwich.’
Strike continued working his way down the list of names.
‘Paul Draper? He’d have been older than you. A teenager, as well.’
‘No, can’t remember a Paul.’
‘Jordan Reaney? Also a teenager.’
‘No, sorry.’
‘Cherie Gittins?’
‘No. I mean, they might have been there, but I can’t remember them if they were.’
‘Margaret Cathcart-Bryce?’
‘Oh God, yes, I remember her,’ said Niamh at once. ‘She was really strange and stretched-looking, she’d had so much work done on her face. She was one of the rich women who used to visit the farm all the time. There was another one who liked grooming the horses, and some of the others took “yoga” with Papa J, but Margaret was the richest of the lot.’
Strike kept reading out names, but the only one Niamh recognised was that of Harold Coates.
‘He was a doctor, wasn’t he?’
‘That’s right,’ said Strike. ‘Did you used to see much of him?’
‘I didn’t, but Maeve did. She kept getting nervous rashes. He used to treat her.’
Strike made a note of this, his face expressionless.
‘D’you remember Jonathan Wace’s daughter?’ asked Robin.
‘Well, no,’ said Niamh, looking confused. ‘She was dead.’
‘Sorry, not Daiyu – I mean his elder daughter, Abigail.’
‘Oh, did he have another one?’ said Niamh, surprised. ‘No, I never met her.’
‘OK,’ said Strike, having made a final note, ‘that’s been helpful, thank you. We’re trying to establish a timeline, find out who was there, and when.’
‘I’m sorry I don’t remember more,’ said Niamh.
Cups of tea finished, they all rose from the table, Robin disengaging her foot carefully from Basil.
‘If,’ said Niamh tentatively, ‘you find out anything about Mum, will you let me know?’
‘Of course,’ said Strike.
‘Thank you. Since having Charlie, I think about Mum such a lot… Oisin and Maeve say they don’t care, but I think it would mean a lot to them, too, if we could find out what happened to her…’
Strike, Robin noticed, looked unusually severe as the three of them headed down the hall, even allowing for the natural surliness of his resting expression. At the front door, Robin thanked Niamh for her time and the biscuits. Basil stood panting beside them, tail wagging, evidently convinced he might yet wheedle fun and treats out of the strangers.
Strike now turned to his partner.
‘You go on. I’d like a private word with Niamh.’
Though surprised, Robin asked no questions, but left. When the sound of her footsteps had disappeared, Strike turned back to Niamh.
‘I’m sorry to ask this,’ he said quietly, looking down at her, ‘but has your younger sister ever talked to you about what Harold Coates did, to cure her rashes?’
‘I think he gave her some cream, that’s all,’ said Niamh, looking nonplussed.
‘She’s never talked about anything else that happened, when he was treating her?’
‘No,’ said Niamh, fear now dawning in her face.
‘How old’s your sister now – twenty-one?’
‘Yes,’ said Niamh.
‘Harold Coates was a paedophile,’ said Strike, and Niamh gasped and clapped her hands to her face. ‘I think you should ask her what happened. She’s probably in need of more help than anti-depressants, and it might be a relief to have someone else know.’
‘Oh my God,’ whispered Niamh through her fingers.
‘I’m sorry,’ repeated Strike. ‘It won’t be much consolation, I know, but Maeve was far from the only one.’
