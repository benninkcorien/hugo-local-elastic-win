The Running Grave
18
Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.
Thus the superior man stands firm
And does not change his direction.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Strike had suspected Charlotte was on her way from the moment Henry had mentioned their mutual connection. Heads were turning; Strike had watched this happen for years; she had the kind of beauty that ran through a room like an icy breeze. As she and Henry made exclamations of surprise (on Henry’s side, probably genuine) and exchanged pleasantries at the door, Strike gathered up his things.
‘Corm,’ said a voice behind him.
‘Hello, Charlotte,’ he said, with his back to her. ‘I’m just leaving.’
‘I need to talk to you. Please. For five minutes.’
‘Afraid I’ve got to be somewhere.’
‘Corm, please. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t – please,’ she said again, more loudly.
He knew she was capable of making a scene if she didn’t get what she wanted. She was a newsworthy woman, and he, too, was now of interest to the papers, and he feared that, if such a scene happened, there would be gossip, and maybe a leak to a journalist.
‘OK, I’ll give you five minutes,’ he said coldly, sitting back down with the last inch of his non-alcoholic beer.
‘Thank you,’ she said breathlessly, and immediately departed for the bar, to buy herself a glass of wine.
She returned within a couple of minutes, shrugged off her black coat to reveal a dark green silk dress, which was cinched at the waist with a heavy black belt, then took the seat Henry had just vacated. She was thinner than he’d ever seen her, though as beautiful as ever, even at the age of forty-one. Her long dark hair fell to beneath her shoulders; her mottled green eyes were fringed with thick, natural lashes, and if she was wearing make-up, it was too subtle to see.
‘I knew you’d be here, as you’ve probably gathered,’ she said, smiling, willing him to smile back, to laugh at her cunning. ‘I suggested this pub to Hen. He’s lovely, isn’t he?’
‘What d’you want?’
‘You’ve lost a ton of weight. You look great.’
‘What,’ Strike repeated, ‘do you want?’
‘To talk.’
‘About…’
‘This is difficult,’ said Charlotte, taking a sip of wine. ‘OK? I need a moment.’
Strike checked his watch. Charlotte glared at him over the rim of her wine glass.
‘OK, fine. I’ve just found out I’ve got cancer.’
Whatever Strike had expected, it wasn’t that. As unpalatable and possibly unjustified as the suspicion might have been, he found himself wondering whether she was lying. He knew her to be not only highly manipulative, but reckless – sometimes self-destructively so – in pursuit of what she wanted.
‘I’m sorry to hear that,’ he said formally.
She looked at him, her colour slowly rising.
‘You think I’m lying, don’t you?’
‘No,’ said Strike. ‘That’d be a fucking despicable thing to lie about.’
‘Yes,’ said Charlotte, ‘it would. Are you going to ask me what kind, or how—?’
‘I thought you were about to tell me,’ said Strike.
‘Breast,’ she said.
‘Right,’ said Strike. ‘Well. I hope you’re OK.’
Tears filled her eyes. He’d seen her cry hundreds of times, out of distress, certainly, but also from rage, and being thwarted, and he wasn’t moved.
‘That’s all you’ve got to say?’
‘What else can I say?’ he said. ‘I do hope you’re OK. For your kids’ sake, apart from anything else.’
‘And that’s… that’s it?’ whispered Charlotte.
Once, she might have started screaming, indifferent to the presence of witnesses, but he could tell she knew that tactic would be unwise now that he wasn’t bound to her.
‘Charlotte,’ he said in a low voice, leaning towards her to make sure he wasn’t overheard, ‘I don’t know how many different ways I can make this clear to you. We’re done. I wish you well, but we’re finished. If you’ve got cancer—’
‘So you do think I’m lying?’
‘Let me finish. If you’ve got cancer, you should be focusing on your health and your loved ones.’
‘My loved ones,’ she repeated. ‘I see.’
She sat back against the leather bench and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. A couple of men at the bar were watching. Perhaps Charlotte, too, had sensed she had an audience, because she now covered her face with her hands and began to sob.
For fuck’s sake.
‘When were you diagnosed?’ he asked her, to stop her crying.
She looked up at once, mopping her sparkling eyes.
‘Last week. Friday.’
‘How?’
‘I went for a routine check on Tuesday, and… yeah, so they phoned me on Friday, and told me they’d found something.’
‘And they already know it’s cancer?’
‘Yes,’ she said, too fast.
‘Well, as I say… I hope you’re OK.’
He made to get up, but she reached across the table and grabbed his wrist tightly.
‘Corm, please hear me out. Seriously. Please. Please. This is life and death. I mean, that makes a person… you remember,’ she whispered, staring into his eyes, ‘after you got your leg blown off… I mean, my God… it makes you realise what’s important. After that, you wanted me. Didn’t you? Wasn’t I the only person in the world you wanted, then?’
‘Did I?’ said Strike, looking into her beautiful face. ‘Or did I just take what was on offer, because it was easiest?’
She recoiled, letting go of his wrist.
All relationships have their own agreed mythology, and central to his and Charlotte’s had been their shared belief that at the lowest point of his life, when he was lying in a hospital bed with half his leg and his military career gone, her return had saved him, giving him something to hold on to, to live for. He knew he’d just shattered a sacred taboo, desecrating what was for her not only a source of pride, but the foundation of her certainty that, however much he might deny it, he continued to love the woman who’d been generous enough to love a mutilated man now career-less and broke.
‘I hope you’ll be OK.’
He got to his feet before she could recover herself enough to retaliate, and walked out, half expecting a beer glass to hit him on the back of the head. By a happy stroke of providence, a vacant black cab slid into view as he stepped out onto the pavement and, barely two minutes after he’d left her, he was speeding away, back towards Denmark Street.
