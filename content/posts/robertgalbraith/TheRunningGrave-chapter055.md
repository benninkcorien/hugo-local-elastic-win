The Running Grave
55
Heaven and earth do not unite…
Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth
In order to escape the difficulties.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
… and Tao took me into one of the [illegible] rooms and wanted Spirit bonding but I managed to fend him off. Giles Harman had just been in there with Lin. She’s barely of age, might be underage, I don’t know.
Emily and [illegible] (can’t remember if I told you about her, she’s quite yung young) have been punished for disobedence. Emily had to stand on a crate with a sign saying she was a dirty pig but Shawna just [illegible] and came back 48 hours & looked terrible.
I found out why I’ve been [illegible] from top group. It’s because I haven’t given any money. I’ll have to go to Mazu and offer a donation, but how do we [illegible] this, can you think of anything because it’s the only way I’m going to be able to stay.
I was also in the little kids’ classroom for the first time and they’re not right, brainwashed and strange, it’s horrible.
Shawna says Becca Pirbright is lying about her [illegible] with Daiyu. I’m going to try and find out more. Think that’s everyting. Shawna also said [illegible] about Jacob being the reason Papa J won’t have kids with Becca. She also says Jacob’s [illegible] by the devil.

I forgot, there’s a picture of a tree with axe in it on the kid’s [illegible], looks recent I’ll try and find it if I can but its hard to think up a reason to come into the woods by daylight.
Strike, who was sitting at the partners’ desk in the office, read Robin’s letter through twice, noting the deterioration of her handwriting and misspellings. This was the first of her reports to contain concrete leads, not to mention information the church definitely wouldn’t want made public, but his expression betrayed no pleasure; on the contrary, he was frowning as he re-read the line about spirit bonding. Hearing footsteps he said, eyes still on the page,
‘Bit worried about her.’
‘Why?’ asked Pat in her usual baritone, setting a mug down beside Strike.
‘Sorry, thought you were Midge,’ said Strike. The subcontractor had just handed him the letter, which she’d retrieved overnight.
‘She had to go, she’s on the Franks. What’s wrong with Robin?’
‘Exhaustion and underfeeding, probably. Cheers,’ he added, picking up his tea.
‘Ryan just called,’ said Pat.
‘Who? Oh, Murphy?’
‘He wanted to know whether he’s had a message from Robin.’
‘Yeah, he has,’ said Strike, handing the folded paper over. He’d resisted reading it, but had been glad to see through the back of the paper that it looked as though it only comprised two or three lines. ‘Don’t tell him I said I’m worried about Robin,’ Strike added.
‘Why would I?’ said Pat, scowling. ‘And you’ve had some voicemail messages. One at nine o’clock last night, from a man called Lucas Messenger. He says he’s Jacob’s brother.’
‘Shit,’ said Strike, who was now ignoring all office phone calls that diverted to his mobile in the evening, on the assumption they were from Charlotte. ‘OK, I’ll call him back.’
‘And three more from the same woman,’ said Pat, her expression austere, ‘all early hours of the morning. She didn’t give her name, but—’
‘Delete them,’ said Strike, reaching for his phone.
‘I think you should listen to them.’
‘Why?’
‘She gets threatening.’
They looked at each other for a few seconds. Strike broke eye contact first.
‘I’ll call Messenger, then I’ll listen to them.’
When Pat had closed the door to the outer office, Strike called Lucas Messenger. After a few rings, a male voice said,
‘Yeah?’
‘Cormoran Strike here. You left a message for me yesterday evening.’
‘Oh—’ A slight distortion on the line told Strike he’d been switched to speakerphone. ‘You’re the detective, yeah? What’s Jacob done? Driven froo annuver window?’
Strike heard a few background sniggers and surmised that Lucas was sharing the conversation with workmates.
‘I’m trying to find out where he is.’
‘Why d’you wanna know? What’s he done?’
‘Did your brother join the Universal Humanitarian Church?’
The laughter on the other end of the line was louder this time.
‘He did, yeah. Twat.’
‘And where is he now?’
‘Germany, I fink. We’re not in touch. He’s me half-brother. We don’t get on.’
‘When did he go to Germany, do you know?’
‘Dunno, some time last year?’
‘Was this a UHC thing? Was he sent to the centre in Munich?’
‘Nah, I fink he met a girl. He’s full of it, I don’t listen to half what he tells me.’
‘Would your parents know where Jacob is?’
‘They’re not talking to him neither. They had a row.’
‘Can you think of anyone who might be in contact with Jacob?’
‘No,’ said Lucas. ‘Like I say, we don’t get on.’
This being the extent of Lucas’ information, Strike hung up a minute later having written only the words Jacob Messenger Germany? on his notepad. Turning in his swivel chair, he looked up at the board on the wall onto which he’d pinned various pictures and notes concerning the UHC case.
In a column on the left-hand side were pictures of people Strike was still trying to locate. At the top were the pictures of the girl who’d variously called herself Carine, Cherie and Cherry, and a printout of the Facebook profile of Carrie Curtis Woods, who he hoped might prove to be the same person.
Beneath Cherie’s pictures was a photo of dark-haired and tanned Jacob Messenger, who stood posing on a beach in his swimming shorts, tensing his abdominal muscles and beaming at the camera. Strike now knew Messenger’s brief flicker of fame had peaked when he came third on a reality show, for which this was a publicity picture. Jacob’s trial and imprisonment for driving under the influence had put his name back in the papers, and his last press appearance had featured photos of him at a UHC addiction services clinic, wearing a tight white T-shirt with the UHC’s logo on it, and announcing how much he’d gained from joining the church. Since then, he’d disappeared from public view.
Strike got to his feet, tore out the page with Jacob Messenger Germany? written on it and pinned it beside the young man’s photo, before picking up Robin’s letter again and re-reading the lines about Jacob. Shawna also said something about Jacob being the reason Papa J won’t have kids with Becca. I didn’t understand that, will try and find out more. She says Jacob’s [illegible] by the devil. Frowning slightly, Strike looked from the letter to the picture of beaming Jacob, with his tropical print swimming trunks and bright white teeth, wondering whether Messenger was indeed the Jacob lying ill at Chapman Farm, and if so, how this fact could possibly relate to Jonathan Wace’s lack of interest in having children with Becca Pirbright.
His gaze moved to the next picture in the left-hand column: the faded photo of bespectacled Deirdre Doherty. In spite of Strike’s best efforts, he still hadn’t found any trace of Deirdre online or off.
The bottom picture on the left-hand side of the board was a drawing: Torment Town’s strange depiction of a fair-haired woman in glasses floating in a dark pool. Strike was still trying to find the true identity of Torment Town, who’d finally responded to his online message.
To Strike’s comment, Amazing pictures. Do you draw from imagination? the anonymous artist had written:
Thanks. Kind of.
Strike had replied:
You’re really talented. You should do a comic book. Horror.
To which Torment Town had responded,
Nobody would want to read that lol
Strike had then said,
You really don’t like the UHC, do you?
But to this, Torment Town had made no reply. Strike was afraid he’d come to the point too quickly and regretted, not for the first time, that he couldn’t set Robin to work on extracting confidences out of whoever had drawn these pictures. Robin was good at building trust online, as she’d proven when she’d persuaded a teenager to give her vital information in one of their previous cases.
Strike closed Pinterest and opened Facebook instead. Carrie Curtis Woods still hadn’t accepted his follower request.
With a sigh, he pushed himself reluctantly up from his chair, and carried his mug of tea and vape pen into the outer office, where Pat sat typing, e-cigarette clamped between her teeth as usual.
‘All right,’ Strike said, sitting down on the red sofa opposite Pat’s desk, ‘let’s hear these threats.’
Pat pressed a button on her desk phone, and Charlotte’s voice, slurred with drink as Strike had expected, filled the room.
‘’S me, pick up, you fucking coward. Pick up…’
A few moments’ silence, then Charlotte’s voice came almost in a shout.
‘OK, then, I’ll leave a fucking message for your precious fucking Robin to hear when she picks up your messages, before giving you your morning blow job. I was there when your leg got blown off, even though we were split up, I stayed with you an’ I visit’d you ev’ry single day, an’ I gave you a place to stay when your whole shitty family gave up on you, and ev’ryone around me saying, “You know he’s on the make” an’ “What’re you doing, he’s an abusive shit?” an’ I wouldn’t listen, even after ev’rything you’d done to me, I was there for you, an’ now when I need a friend you can’t even fucking meet me fr’a coffee when I’ve got fucking cancer, you fucking leech, you user, an’ I’m still protecting you to the fucking press even though I could tell them things that’d fucking finish you, I could finish you if I told them, and why should I be fucking loyal wh—’
A loud beep cut the message off. Pat’s expression was impassive. There was a click, then a second message began.
‘Pick up. Fucking pick up, you cowardly bastard… after everything you did to me, you expect me to defend you to the press. You walked out after I miscarried, you fucking threw me across that fucking boat, you fucked every girl that moved when we were together, does precious Robin know what she’s letting hersel—’
This time there was no beep: Pat had slammed her hand onto a button on the phone, silencing voicemail. Littlejohn’s silhouette had appeared outside the frosted glass in the door onto the stairwell. The door opened.
‘Morning,’ said Strike.
‘Morning,’ said Littlejohn, looking down at Strike through his heavy-lidded eyes. ‘Need to file my report on Toy Boy.’
Strike watched in silence as Littlejohn retrieved the file from the drawer and added a couple of sheets of notes. Pat had begun typing again, e-cigarette waggling between her teeth, ignoring both men. When Littlejohn had replaced the file in the drawer, he turned to Strike and for the first time in their acquaintance, initiated conversation.
‘Think you should know, I might be being followed.’
‘Followed?’ repeated Strike, eyebrows raised.
‘Yeah. Pretty sure I’ve seen the same guy watching me, three days apart.’
‘Any reason someone would be watching you?’
‘No,’ said Littlejohn, with a trace of defiance.
‘Nothing you’re not telling me?’
‘Like what?’ said Littlejohn.
‘Wife not planning a divorce? Creditors trying to track you down?’
‘’Course not,’ said Littlejohn. ‘I thought it might be something to do with this place.’
‘What, the agency?’ said Strike.
‘Yeah… made a few enemies along the way, haven’t you?’
‘Yeah,’ said Strike, after a sip of tea, ‘but they’re nearly all in jail.’
‘You tangled with terrorists last year,’ said Littlejohn.
‘What did the person watching you look like?’ asked Strike.
‘Skinny black guy.’
‘Probably not a neo-Nazi, then,’ said Strike, making a mental note to tell Shanker the skinny black guy would need replacing.
‘Could be press,’ said Littlejohn. ‘That Private Eye story about you.’
‘Think they’ve mistaken you for me, do you?’
‘No,’ said Littlejohn.
‘Well, if you want to hand in your notice because you’re scared of—’
‘I’m not scared,’ said Littlejohn curtly. ‘Just thought you ought to know.’
When Strike didn’t respond, Littlejohn said,
‘Maybe I made a mistake.’
‘No, it’s good you’re keeping your eyes open,’ said Strike insincerely. ‘Let me know if you see the guy again.’
‘Will do.’
Littlejohn left the office without another word, casting a sideways look at Pat as he passed her. The office manager continued to stare determinedly at her monitor. Once Littlejohn’s footsteps had died away, Strike pointed at the phone.
‘Is there much more of that?’
‘She called again,’ said Pat, ‘but it’s more of the same. Threatening to go to the press with all her made-up nonsense.’
‘How d’you know it’s made-up nonsense?’ said Strike perversely.
‘You never assaulted her, I know that.’
‘You don’t know anything of the bloody sort,’ said Strike irritably, getting up from the sofa to fetch a banana from the kitchen area, instead of the chocolate biscuit he really fancied.
‘You might be a grumpy sod,’ said Pat, scowling, ‘but I can’t see you knocking a woman around.’
‘Thanks for the vote of confidence,’ said Strike. ‘Be sure and tell the Mail that when they come calling – and delete those messages.’
Well aware that he was venting his anger on the office manager, he forced himself to say,
‘You’re right: I never threw her across a boat and I never did any of the other stuff she’s shouting about, either.’
‘She doesn’t like Robin,’ said Pat, looking up at him, her dark eyes shrewd behind the lenses of her reading glasses. ‘Jealous.’
‘There’s nothing—’
‘I know that,’ said Pat. ‘She’s with Ryan, isn’t she?’
Strike took a moody bite of banana.
‘So what are you going to do?’ asked Pat.
‘Nothing,’ said Strike, his mouth full. ‘I don’t negotiate with terrorists.’
‘Hm,’ said Pat. She took a deep drag on her e-cigarette then spoke through a cloud of vapour. ‘You can’t trust a drinker. Never know what they might do when the brakes are off.’
‘I’m not going to be held over a barrel for the rest of my life,’ said Strike. ‘She had sixteen fucking years from me. That’s enough.’
Throwing the banana skin into the bin, he headed back to the inner office.
Charlotte’s swerve from kindliness to vehement recrimination and threats came as no surprise to Strike, who’d endured her mood swings for years. Clever, funny and often endearing, Charlotte was also capable of fathomless spite, not to mention a self-destructive recklessness that had led her to sever relationships on a whim or to take extreme physical risks. Various psychiatrists and therapists had had their say over the years, each trying to corral her unpredictability and unhappiness into some neat medical classification. She’d been prescribed drugs, ricocheted between counsellors and been admitted to therapeutic facilities, yet Strike knew something in Charlotte herself had stubbornly resisted help. She’d always insisted that nothing the medical or psychiatric profession offered would ever, or could ever, help her. Only Strike could do that, she’d insisted time and again: only Strike could save her from herself.
Without realising it, he’d sat down in Robin’s chair instead of his own, facing the board on which he’d pinned the notes and pictures related to the UHC case, but thinking about Charlotte. He well remembered the night on the barge owned by one of her friends, the vicious row that had erupted after Charlotte had consumed a bottle and a half of wine, and the hasty departure of the rest of the intoxicated party, who’d left Strike alone to deal with a knife-wielding Charlotte who was threatening to stab herself. He’d disarmed her physically, and in the process she’d slipped over onto the floor. Ever afterwards, when she lost her temper, she’d claimed he’d thrown her. Doubtless if he’d listened to the third message he’d have been accused of other assaults, of infidelity and cruelty: in Charlotte’s telling, whenever she was drunk or angry, he was a monster of unparalleled sadism.
Six years since the relationship had ended for good, Strike had come to see that the unfixable problem between them was that he and Charlotte could never agree what reality was. She disputed everything: times, dates and events, who’d said what, how rows started, whether they were together or had broken up when he’d had other relationships. He still didn’t know whether the miscarriage she claimed she’d had shortly before they parted forever had been real: she’d never shown him proof of pregnancy, and the shifting dates might have suggested either that she wasn’t sure who the father was, or that the whole thing was imaginary. Sitting here today, he asked himself how he, whose entire professional life was an endless quest for truth, could have endured it all for so long.
With a grimace, Strike got to his feet yet again, picked up his notebook and pen and approached the board on the wall, willing himself to focus, because the following morning he’d be heading up to HMP Bedford to interview Jordan Reaney. His eyes travelled back up the left-hand column to the picture of Cherie Gittins, whose spell at Chapman Farm had overlapped with that of Reaney. After a few moments’ contemplation of her pictures, he called Pat through to the inner office.
‘You’ve got a daughter, right?’ he said.
‘Yeah,’ said Pat, frowning.
‘How old is she?’
‘The hell are you asking me that for?’ said Pat, her simian face turning red. Strike, who’d never seen her blush before, had no idea what had engendered this strange reaction. Wondering whether she could possibly have imagined he had dishonourable designs on her daughter, whom he’d never met, he said,
‘I’m trying to get access to this woman’s Facebook profile. It’s set to private and she hasn’t accepted my follow request. I thought, if your daughter’s already on Facebook, with an established history, she might have a better chance. Another mother might seem less—’
‘My daughter’s not on Facebook.’
‘OK,’ said Strike. ‘Sorry,’ he added, though he wasn’t sure why he was apologising.
Strike had the impression Pat wanted to say something else, but after a few seconds, she returned to the outer office. The tapping of computer keys resumed shortly afterwards.
Still puzzled by her reaction, he turned back to the board, eyes now on the pictures in the right-hand column, which featured four people who’d lived at Chapman Farm and met unnatural deaths.
At the top was an old news clipping about the death of Paul Draper, which Strike had found a couple of days earlier. Headlined ‘Couple Sentenced for Killing of “Modern Slave”’, the article detailed how Draper had been sleeping rough when a couple offered him a bed for the night. Both of his putative rescuers had previous convictions for violence, and had set Draper to doing building work for them, forcing him to sleep in their shed. Draper’s death six months later had occurred during a beating. His starved and partially burned body had been discovered on a nearby building site. The detective had had no success in tracing any living relative of Draper, whose picture showed a timid-looking, moon-faced youth of nineteen with short, wispy hair.
Strike’s gaze now moved to the Polaroids Robin had sent from Chapman Farm, showing the naked foursome in pig masks. The hair of the male being sodomised by the tattooed man might possibly be Draper’s, although given the age of the Polaroids, it was impossible to be certain.
Beneath Draper’s picture was the only photo of Kevin Pirbright Strike had been able to find, again taken from the news report of his murder. It showed a pale, apologetic-looking young man whose skin was pitted with acne scars. Beside the picture of Kevin was that of the murder scene. For the umpteenth time, Strike stared at that bit of gouged-out wall, and the single word ‘pigs’ that remained.
The last two pictures on the board were the oldest: those of Jonathan Wace’s first wife, Jennifer, and of Daiyu.
Jennifer Wace’s teased and permed hairstyle reminded Strike of the girls he’d known during his school days in the mid-eighties, but she’d been a very attractive woman. Nothing Strike had found out so far contradicted her daughter’s belief that her drowning had been a complete accident.
Lastly, he turned his attention to the picture of Daiyu. Rabbity-faced, with her overbite and her missing tooth, she beamed out of the blurry newsprint picture at the detective: dead at seven years old, on the same beach as Jennifer Wace.
He turned from the board and reached for his phone again. He’d already made multiple fruitless attempts to contact the Heatons, who’d witnessed Cherie running screaming up the beach after Daiyu’s drowning. Nevertheless, more in hope than expectation, he called their number again.
To his amazement, the phone was answered after three rings.
‘Hello?’ said a female voice.
‘Hi,’ said Strike, ‘is this Mrs Heaton?’
‘No, iss me, Gillian,’ said the woman, who had a strong Norfolk accent. ‘Who’s this?’
‘I’m trying to contact Mr and Mrs Heaton,’ said Strike. ‘Have they sold their house?’
‘No,’ said Gillian, ‘I’m jus’ here waterin’ the plants. They’re still in Spain. Who’s this?’ she asked again.
‘My name’s Cormoran Strike. I’m a private detective, and I was wondering whether I could speak—’
‘Strike?’ said the woman on the end of the line. ‘You’re not him who got that strangler?’
‘That’s me. I was hoping to speak to Mr and Mrs Heaton about the drowning of a little girl in 1995. They were witnesses at the inquest.’
‘Blimey, yeah,’ said Gillian. ‘I remember that. We’re old friends.’
‘Are they likely to be back in the country soon? I’d rather speak to them in person, but if they can’t—’
‘Well, Leonard broke his leg, see,’ said Gillian, ‘so they stopped out in Fuengirola a bit longer. They’ve got a place out there. He’s getting better, though. Shelley reckons they’ll be back in a couple of weeks.’
‘Would you mind asking if they’d be prepared to speak to me when they get home? I’m happy to come to Cromer,’ added Strike, who wanted to take a look at the place Jennifer and Daiyu had died.
‘Oh,’ said Gillian, who sounded quite excited. ‘Right. I’m sure they’d be happy to help.’
Strike gave the woman his number, thanked her, hung up, then turned to face the board on the wall once more.
There was only one other item pinned to it: a few lines of a poem, which had been printed in a local Norfolk newspaper as part of a grieving widower’s tribute to his dead wife.
Came up that cold sea at Cromer like a running grave
Beside her as she struck
Wildly towards the shore, but the blackcapped wave
Crossed her and swung her back…
The imagery was powerful, but it wasn’t Wace’s. Strike had had a feeling upon reading the lines that he’d heard something like them before, and sure enough, he’d traced them to poet George Barker’s ‘On a Friend’s Escape from Drowning off the Norfolk Coast’. Wace had taken the opening lines of Barker’s poem and switched the pronouns, for Barker’s friend had been male.
It was a shameless piece of plagiarism and Strike was surprised that nobody at the newspaper had spotted it. He was interested not only in the brazenness of the theft, but in the egoism of the widower who’d wanted to figure as a man of poetic gifts in the immediate wake of his wife’s drowning, not to mention the choice of a poem that described the way in which Jennifer must have died, rather than her qualities in life. Even though Abigail had painted her father as a grifter and a narcissist, she’d claimed Wace had been genuinely upset about her mother’s death. The tawdry act of stealing Barker’s poem to get himself into the local paper was not, in Strike’s view, the act of a man truly grieving at all.
For another minute he stood contemplating the pictures of individuals who’d met unnatural deaths, two by drowning, one by beating, and one by a single gunshot to the head. His gaze moved again to the Polaroids of the four young people in pig masks. Then he sat back down at the desk, and scribbled a few more questions for Jordan Reaney.
