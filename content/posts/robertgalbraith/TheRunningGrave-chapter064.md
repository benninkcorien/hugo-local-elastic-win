The Running Grave
64
Nine in the third place…
Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south…
One must not expect perseverance too soon.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Strike woke next morning to a moment of confusion as to where he was. He’d been dreaming that he was sitting beside Robin in her old Land Rover and exchanging anecdotes about drowning, which in the dream both had experienced several times.
Bleary eyed, he reached across to his mobile to silence the alarm and immediately saw that seven texts had come in over the last half an hour: from Pat, Lucy, Prudence, Shanker, Ilsa, Dave Polworth and journalist Fergus Robertson. With a lurch of dread, he opened Pat’s message.
Her sister’s just called. I said you weren’t here. Hope you’re all right.
Strike opened Lucy’s next.
Stick, I’m so sorry, I’ve just seen. It’s awful. I don’t know what else to say. Hope you’re ok xxx
Now with a real sense of foreboding, Strike hitched himself up in bed and opened the text from Fergus Robertson.
I’ve got the news desk asking if you’ve got a comment. Might be wise to give them something, get everyone off your back. Don’t know if you’re aware, but there’s a rumour she left a note.
His heart now beating uncomfortably fast, Strike opened his phone browser and typed in Charlotte’s name.
Death of an It-Girl: Charlotte Campbell Found Dead
Former Wild Child Charlotte Campbell Found Dead by Cleaner
Charlotte Campbell Dead in Wake of Assault Charge
He stared at the headlines, unable to take in what he was seeing. Then he pressed the link to the last story.
Charlotte Campbell, model and socialite, has died by suicide at the age of 41, her family’s lawyer confirmed on Friday evening. In a statement issued to The Times, Campbell’s mother and sister said,
‘Our beloved Charlotte took her own life on Thursday night. Charlotte was under considerable stress following a baseless accusation of assault and subsequent harassment by the press. We request privacy at this very difficult time, particularly for Charlotte’s adored young children.’
‘We’ve lost the funniest, cleverest, most original woman any of us knew,’ said Campbell’s half-brother, actor Sacha Legard, in a separate statement. ‘I’m just one of the heartbroken people who loved her, struggling to comprehend the fact that we’ll never hear her laugh again. Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.’
The younger daughter of broadcaster Sir Anthony Campbell and model Tara Clairmont, Campbell married Jago Ross, Viscount of Croy, in 2011. The couple had twins before divorcing last year. Prior to her marriage she was the long-term girlfriend of private detective Cormoran Strike, eldest son of rock star Jonny Rokeby. More recently Campbell dated Landon Dormer, American billionaire scion of the Dormer hotel empire, but the relationship ended ten days ago with Campbell’s arrest for assault. Friends of Dormer assert that he required stitches to his face after an altercation at Dormer’s Fitzrovia apartment.
Campbell, who first made news when she ran away from Cheltenham Ladies’ College aged 14, gained a degree in Classics at Oxford before becoming a regular fixture on the London social scene. Described as ‘mercurial and mesmerising’ by Vogue, she worked intermittently as a model and fashion writer, and spent several spells in rehab during the 90s and 00s. In 2014 she was admitted to the controversial Symonds House, a private psychiatric and addiction clinic, from which she was hospitalised after what was later described as an accidental overdose.
Campbell’s body is believed to have been discovered by a cleaner yesterday morning at her Mayfair flat.
Blood thudded in Strike’s ears. He scrolled slowly back up the article.
Two pictures accompanied the piece: the first showed Charlotte in academic gown alongside her parents on her graduation day at Oxford in the nineties. Strike remembered seeing the picture in the press while stationed in Germany with the military police. Unbeknownst to Sir Anthony and his wife, Tara, both of whom had loathed Strike, he and Charlotte had already resumed their affair at long distance.
The second picture showed Charlotte smiling into the camera, wearing a heavy, emerald-studded choker. This was a publicity still for a jewellery collection, and the irrelevant thought flashed through his numb brain that the designer, whom he’d briefly dated, would surely be glad it had been used.
‘Fuck,’ he muttered, pushing himself up on his pillows. ‘Fuck.’
Shock was battling a heavy sense of absolute inevitability. The final hand had been played and Charlotte had been wiped out, with nothing more to bet and nowhere to find credit. She must have done it right after calling him. Had one of the voicemail messages he’d deleted made her intentions explicit? After threatening to go to Robin and tell her what Strike really was, had Charlotte broken down and pleaded with him to contact her once more? Had she threatened (as she’d done so many times before) to kill herself if he didn’t give her what she wanted?
Mechanically, Strike opened the other texts he’d been sent. He could have predicted all of them except Dave Polworth’s. Dave had always loathed Charlotte, and had often told Strike he was a fool to keep taking her back.
Bit of a fucker this, Diddy.
These were the exact words Polworth had spoken on first visiting Strike in Selly Oak Military Hospital, following Strike’s loss of half a leg.
Strike set down his phone without answering any of the texts, swung his one and a half legs out of the bed and hopped off towards the bathroom, using the wall and the door jamb to balance. Amidst the many emotions now assailing him was a terrible echo of the day he’d found out his mother had died. Grief stricken though he’d been, the burden of worry and dread he’d carried with him like a dead weight throughout Leda’s second marriage to a violent, volatile, drug-using younger man had become redundant: he’d never again need to fear hearing terrible news, because the news had come. A similar, shameful trace of relief was twisted in among his conflicting emotions now: the worst had happened, so he need never again fear the worst.
Having emptied his bladder and cleaned his teeth, he dressed and put on his prosthesis, entirely forgetting breakfast. He checked out of the hotel, so distracted that he couldn’t have said with any certainty what sex the receptionist was.
Could he have stopped it happening? Yes, probably, but at what cost? Ongoing contact, escalating demands and pleas to reunite with a woman who lived half addicted to her own pain. He’d long since abandoned the hope of any possibility of real change in Charlotte, because of her adamantine resistance to any succour but drink, drugs and Cormoran Strike.
He drove out of rainswept Cromer thinking about Charlotte’s messy, fractured family, which was littered with step-parents and half-siblings and riven with feuds and addiction. Our beloved Charlotte…
Strike was passing Chapman Farm. He glanced left, and spotted that odd tower on the horizon again. On a whim, he took the next left turn. He was going to find out what that tower actually was.
Why on earth this, now? said Charlotte’s angry voice in his head. What does it matter?
It matters to me, Strike replied silently.
His one unfailing refuge and distraction in times of trouble, ever since he could remember, had been to detangle and unravel, to try and impose order on the chaotic world, to resolve mysteries, to scratch his persistent itch for truth. Finding out what that tower really was had nothing to do with Charlotte, yet had everything to do with Charlotte. He wasn’t a little boy any more, vaguely threatened by the watching tower, even though there were far more things to worry about closer at hand, with his mother out of sight in the woods and predators all around him. Nor was he the nineteen-year-old who’d fallen in love with Oxford’s most beautiful student, too dazzled and disarmed that she seemed to love him back to see her clearly. If he did nothing else today, he’d demystify the tower that had lurked in his memory as a symbol of one of the worst times of his life.
It took him only a few minutes to reach the hilltop in the BMW, and there it was: a church, as he should have known it would be: a very old Norfolk church, faced with flint rubble like so many of the buildings he’d passed in Cromer.
He got out of the car. A sign at the entrance to the small graveyard told him this was St John the Baptist Church. Driven by impulses he didn’t fully understand he passed through the gate, and found himself trying the door of the church. He’d expected it to be locked, but it opened.
The interior was small, white-walled, and empty. Strike’s footsteps echoed as he walked up the aisle, eyes fixed on a plain gold cross on the altar. Then he sat down on one of the hard wooden pews.
He didn’t believe in God, but some of the people he’d loved and admired did. His Aunt Joan had had an unshowy faith, and her belief in certain forms and structures had provided a jarring contrast to his mother’s disdain for boundaries and every form of small-town respectability. Joan had made Strike and Lucy go to Sunday school during their spells in St Mawes, and these sessions had bored and oppressed him as a child, yet the memory of those lessons was strangely pleasing as he sat on the hard pew: how much sweeter had the dash to the beach been, afterwards? How much more satisfying the games of imagination he and Lucy had played, once released from the tiresome activities they were forced to do while Ted and Joan were taking communion? Perhaps, he thought vaguely, a bit of boredom was no bad thing for kids.
Footsteps behind Strike made him look round.
‘Good morning,’ said the newcomer, a man in late middle age with a long, pale face and mild eyes, like a sheep. His trousers were fastened with bicycle clips, which Strike hadn’t seen for years.
‘Morning,’ said the detective.
‘Everything ollright?’
Strike wondered whether the man was the rector. He wore no dog collar, but then, of course, it wasn’t Sunday. How can you think about that now, why do you care about his dog collar, why this mania for working things out?
‘Someone I know’s just died.’
‘I’m very sorry to hear that,’ said the man, with such obvious sincerity that Strike said, as though to console the stranger,
‘She’d been unwell for a long time.’
‘Ah,’ said the man. ‘Still.’
‘Yeah,’ said Strike.
‘I’ll leave you,’ said the other, his voice now hushed, and he proceeded down the aisle and out of sight, into what Strike assumed was the vestry, probably removing himself so that Strike could pray in peace. He did in fact close his eyes, though not to speak to God. He knew what Charlotte would have said to him now, if she were here.
I’m out of your hair now, Bluey. You should be glad.
I didn’t want you dead, he answered, inside his head.
But you knew you were the only one who could save me. I warned you, Bluey.
You can’t hold onto someone by threatening to top yourself if they leave. It isn’t right. You had kids. You should have stayed alive for them.
Ah, OK. He could visualise her cold smile. Well, if that’s how you want to frame this. I’m dead. I can’t argue.
Don’t play that game with me. His anger was rising as though she were really here in this silent church. I gave you everything I had to give. I put up with shit I’ll never put up with again.
Robin’s a saint, is she? How boring, said Charlotte, now smirking at him. You used to like a challenge.
She’s not a saint any more than I am, but she’s a good person.
And now, to his anger, he felt tears coming.
I want a good person for a change, Charlotte. I’m sick of filth and mess and scenes. I want something different.
Would Robin kill herself over you?
Of course she wouldn’t. She’s got more bloody sense.
Everything we had, everything we shared, and you want someone sensible? The Cormoran I knew would have laughed at the idea of wanting someone sensible. Don’t you remember? ‘Suns rise and set, but for us there’s one brief day then one perpetual night. So kiss me a thousand times…’
I was a messed-up fucking kid when I quoted that at you. That’s not who I am any more. But I’d still rather you’d lived, and been happy.
I was never happy, said the Charlotte who was sometimes brutally honest, when nothing else had worked, and another vicious scene had left both of them exhausted. Amused, sometimes. Never happy.
Yeah, I know.
And he echoed the kindly man in the bicycle clips.
Still.
He opened his damp eyes again to stare at the cross on the altar. He might not believe, but the cross meant something to him, nonetheless. It stood for Ted and Joan, for order and stability, but also for the unknowable and unresolvable, for the human craving for meaning in chaos, and for the hope of something beyond the world of pain and endless striving. Some mysteries were eternal and unresolvable by man, and there was relief in accepting that, in admitting it. Death, love, the endless complexity of human beings: only a fool would claim to fully understand any of them.
And as he sat in this humble old church, with the round tower that lost its sinister aspect when seen up close, he looked back on the teenager who’d left Leda and her dangerous naivety only to fall for Charlotte, and her equally dangerous sophistication, and knew definitively, for the first time, that he was no longer the person who’d craved either of them. He forgave the teenager who’d pursued a destructive force because he thought he could tame it, and thereby right the universe, and make all comprehensible and safe. He wasn’t so different from Lucy, after all. They’d both set out to refashion their worlds, they’d just done it in very different ways. If he was lucky, he had half his life to live again, and it was time to give up things far more harmful than smoking and chips, time to admit to himself he should seek something new, as opposed to what was damaging but familiar.
The kindly sheep-faced man had reappeared. As he made his way back down the aisle, he paused uncertainly beside Strike.
‘I hope you’ve found what you needed.’
‘I have,’ said Strike. ‘Thank you.’
