The Running Grave
94
There are secret forces at work, leading together those who belong together. We must yield to this attraction; then we make no mistakes.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
It took Strike an hour to reach the police station to which Robin had been taken. As he slowed down, looking for a place to park, he passed three figures who appeared to be arguing outside the square stone building. Once he’d found a parking space and walked back towards the station, he recognised the threesome as Robin and her parents.
‘Strike,’ said Robin in relief, when she spotted him.
‘Hello,’ said Strike, holding out his hand to Michael Ellacott, a tall man in horn-rimmed glasses. ‘Sorry I didn’t pick up sooner. I was in the middle of something I couldn’t drop.’
‘What’s happened?’ said Robin.
‘The Franks made their move. What’s going—?’
‘We’re about to take Robin home,’ said Linda. ‘She’s been through—’
‘For God’s sake, Mum,’ said Robin, shrugging off the hand Linda had laid on her arm, ‘I need to tell Cormoran what’s just happened.’
‘He can come back to the flat,’ said Linda, as though this was a favour Strike didn’t deserve.
‘I know he can come back to my flat,’ said Robin, who was rapidly reaching breaking point with her mother, ‘but that’s not what’s going to happen. He and I are going for a drink. Take my keys.’
She thrust them into her father’s hands.
‘You can grab a taxi, and Cormoran can drop me off later. Look – there’s a cab now.’
Robin raised her hand, and the black taxi slowed.
‘I’d rather—’ began Linda.
‘I’m going for a drink with Cormoran. I know you’re worried, Mum, but there’s nothing you can do about this. I’ve got to sort it out.’
‘You can’t blame your mum for being worried,’ said Strike, but judging by Linda’s frigid expression, this effort to ingratiate himself was unsuccessful. Once her parents had been successfully bundled into the cab, Robin waited until the vehicle had drawn away before letting out a huge sigh of relief.
‘Un-bloody-believable.’
‘In fairness—’
‘I really, really need a drink.’
‘There’s a pub up there, I just passed it,’ said Strike.
‘Are you limping?’ said Robin, as they set off.
‘It’s fine, I twisted my knee a bit when I punched Frank One.’
‘Oh God, did—?’
‘It’s all good, police will have got them by now, Mayo’s safe – tell me what happened at the station.’
‘I’m going to need alcohol first,’ said Robin.
The pub was crowded, but a small corner table became available a minute after their entrance. Strike’s bulk, always useful in such situations, ensured that other would-be sitters were blocked from taking it before Robin could.
‘What d’you want?’ he asked Robin, as she sank onto a banquette.
‘Something strong – and could you get me some crisps? I was about to eat a pizza when the police arrived. I haven’t had anything since mid-afternoon.’
Strike returned to the table five minutes later with a neat double whisky, half a pint of lager for himself and six packets of salt and vinegar crisps.
‘Thank you,’ said Robin fervently, reaching for her glass.
‘Right, tell me what happened,’ said Strike, lowering himself onto an uncomfortable stool, but Robin had thrown back half the neat whisky so fast she got some in her windpipe and had to cough for a minute before she could talk again.
‘Sorry,’ she gasped, her eyes watering. ‘Well, the Norfolk police have been to the farm. Jonathan and Mazu were completely bemused as to why the police wanted to search the top floor of the farmhouse, but led them up there—’
‘And there was no Jacob,’ guessed Strike.
‘Correct. There was nothing in the end room but some old suitcases. They searched the whole top floor but he wasn’t there, but when the police asked where Jacob was, Jonathan said, oh, you want Jacob, and took them to him… except it wasn’t Jacob.’
‘They showed them a different child?’
‘Exactly. He answered to Jacob and told them a nasty lady called Robin—’
‘He used your real name?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin hopelessly. ‘Vivienne must have talked. I answered accidentally to “Robin” one day – I passed it off as a nickname and I’m sure she believed me at the time, but I s’pose – anyway, the fake Jacob told the police I’d taken him into a bathroom and… and done things to him.’
‘What things?’
‘Asked him to pull his pants down and show me his willy. He claims that when he wouldn’t do it, I hit him round the head.’
‘Shit,’ Strike muttered.
‘That’s not all. They’ve got two adult witnesses saying I was rough with the children at the farm and kept trying to take them off on my own. The police wouldn’t tell me who they are, but I said, if it was Taio or Becca, they had good reason to want me incriminated on a child abuse charge. I explained I was there to investigate the church. I had the feeling Harding – that’s the man – thought I was cocky or something, coming from our agency.’
‘There’s a bit of that about,’ said Strike. ‘Patterson’s an old mate of Carver’s, as I found out from Littlejohn. Were the police recording the interview?’
‘Yes.’
‘How did it end?’
‘They told me they’ve got no further questions at the moment,’ said Robin. ‘I think the female officer believed me, but I’m not sure about Harding. He kept going back over the same ground, trying to make me change my story, and he got quite forceful at one point. I asked them whether anyone was going to go back to the farm and find the real Jacob, but obviously, as I’m now a person of suspicion, they weren’t going to tell me that. What the hell have the Waces done with that boy? What if—?’
‘You’ve already done as much for Jacob as you can,’ said Strike. ‘With luck, you’ve worried the police enough to make them do another search. Eat your crisps.’
Robin ripped open one of the packets and did as she was told.
‘I already knew the church must’ve identified us,’ said Strike. ‘Fergus Robertson just called me. Apparently my Wikipedia page has been given a UHC makeover.’
‘Oh no,’ said Robin.
‘It was inevitable. Someone found that plastic rock, and Taio got a good look at me at the perimeter fence before I hit him. Now we’ve just got to try and limit the damage.’
‘Have you read the Wikipedia stuff about you?’
‘Not yet, I haven’t had time, but Robertson gave me a good idea of what’s on there. I might need a legal letter to get it taken down. Matter of fact, I know just the bloke I can ask for advice.’
‘Who?’
‘Andrew Honbold. He’s a QC. Bijou’s partner.’
‘I thought you and Bijou were—?’
‘Christ, no, she’s a fucking nutter,’ said Strike, forgetting he’d pretended he was still seeing Bijou when he and Robin had been at Felbrigg Lodge. ‘Honbold’s fairly well disposed to me at the moment and as defamation’s his speciality—’
‘He’s well disposed to you?’ said Robin, thoroughly confused. ‘Even though—?’
‘He thinks Bijou and I had nothing more than a couple of drinks and she’s not going to tell him different, not when she’s pregnant with his kid.’
‘Right,’ said Robin, who was finding this onslaught of information dizzying.
‘Murphy booked an early flight yet?’ said Strike, who hoped not.
‘No, he hasn’t managed to get one,’ said Robin. ‘So it’ll be Sunday.’
‘And he’ll be all right with you heading to Thornbury on Monday, will he?’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Robin, ripping open a second pack of crisps. ‘He’s back at work himself Monday morning. Mind you, he might ditch me once he finds out I’m facing child abuse charges.’
‘You’re not going to be charged,’ said Strike firmly.
Easy for you to say, thought the shaken Robin, but aloud she said,
‘Well, I hope not, because I found out this afternoon I’m soon going to have another two nieces or nephews. I’d rather not be barred from ever seeing them…’
