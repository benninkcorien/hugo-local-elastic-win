The Running Grave
126
In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the game from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to run off.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Robin parted from Strike in Tottenham Court Road, and arrived in Wardour Street ten minutes later. It was swarming with Saturday evening visitors to Chinatown, but she couldn’t see Midge. Her phone now charged sufficiently for at least one call, Robin called the subcontractor’s number.
‘Where are you? Strike told me you were watching the Rupert Court Temple.’
‘I was,’ said Midge, ‘but Becca’s left. I’m following her.’
‘Shit,’ said Robin, for the second time in as many hours. ‘No, I mean, it’s good that you’re still on her, but – is she alone? She hasn’t got a bag or anything, has she? Does she look as though she’s going on a trip?’
‘She’s alone, and there’s no bag,’ said Midge. ‘She might just be buying food. She’s looking at her phone a lot.’
‘I’ll bet she is,’ said Robin. ‘Will you keep me posted on where you are? I’m in the vicinity of the temple. Let me know if she’s on her way back.’
‘Will do,’ said Midge, and she rang off.
Deprived in the short term of her prey, frustrated and tense, Robin moved out of the way of a group of drunken men. Fiddling with the skeleton keys in her pocket, she contemplated the red and gold creatures over the door of the temple: the dragon, the pheasant, the sheep, the horse, the cow, the dog, the rooster, and, of course, the pig.
