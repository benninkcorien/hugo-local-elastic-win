The Running Grave
117
K’an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the body, the principle of light enclosed in the dark – that is, reason.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
It was only as Robin approached Prudence’s house that she registered, in some dim region of her mind, that she’d spotted a blue Ford Focus in her rear-view mirror at another point in the journey. She rounded the corner of Prudence’s street, and the blue car drove innocently past. Preoccupied with the imminent meeting between Will and Flora, Robin immediately forgot it again.
‘You’ll like Prudence,’ she said reassuringly to Will, who’d barely spoken during the journey. ‘She’s really nice.’
Will looked up at the large Edwardian house, shoulders hunched and arms folded, an expression of intense misgiving on his face.
‘Hi,’ said Prudence, when she opened the front door, looking understatedly elegant as ever in cream trousers and a matching sweater. ‘Oh.’
Her face had fallen on seeing Strike.
‘Problem?’ he asked, wondering whether she’d expected him to call and apologise after their last, heated phone call. As he considered himself entirely blameless in the matter of identifying Flora, the idea hadn’t occurred to him.
‘I assumed it would just be Robin,’ said Prudence, standing back to let them all in. ‘Flora isn’t expecting another man.’
‘Ah,’ said Strike. ‘Right. I could wait in the car?’
‘Don’t be silly,’ said Prudence, with a slight awkwardness. ‘You can go in the sitting room.’
‘Thanks,’ said Strike. He caught Robin’s eye, then headed wordlessly through the door to the right. Prudence opened a door on the left.
Like the sitting room, Prudence’s consulting room was tastefully decorated in neutral colours. A few decorative objects, including jade snuff bottles and a Chinese puzzle ball, were arranged on wall shelves. There was a sofa upholstered in cream, a flourishing palm tree in the corner and an antique rug on the floor.
A pale and very heavy woman of around thirty was sitting in a low, black, steel-framed chair. Every item she wore was dark and baggy. Robin noticed the thin white self-harm scars on her neck, and the way she was clutching both cuffs of her long-sleeved top, so as to hold them down over her hands. Her curly hair was arranged to cover as much of her face as possible, though a pair of large, beautiful brown eyes were just visible.
‘Have a seat, Will,’ said Prudence. ‘Anywhere you like.’
After a moment’s indecision, he chose a chair. Robin sat down on the sofa.
‘So: Flora, Will, Will, Flora,’ said Prudence, smiling as she sat down too.
‘Hi,’ said Flora.
‘Hi,’ muttered Will.
When neither of them showed any further inclination for interacting with each other, Prudence said,
‘Flora was in the UHC for five years, Will, and I think you were in for—’
‘Four, yeah.’
Will’s eyes were darting around the room, lingering on some of the objects.
‘How long have you been out?’ he shot suddenly at Flora.
‘Um… eleven years,’ said Flora, peering at Will through her fringe.
Will got up so suddenly, Flora gasped. Pointing at her, Will snarled at Robin,
‘It’s a trap. She’s still working for them.’
‘I’m not!’ exclaimed Flora indignantly.
‘She’s in on it, as well!’ Will said, now pointing at Prudence. ‘This place –’ He looked from the Chinese puzzle ball to the antique rug, ‘it’s just like Zhou’s office!’
‘Will,’ said Robin, getting to her feet, too, ‘why on earth would I have gone undercover at Chapman Farm to get you out, only to lead you straight back to them?’
‘They fooled you! Or, it’s all been a test. You’re an agent of the church too!’
‘You found the plastic rock,’ said Robin calmly. ‘You saw the torch and the traces of my notes. If I were a church agent, why would I have been writing to outsiders? And how would I have known you’d find the rock at all?’
‘I want to go back to Pat’s,’ said Will desperately. ‘I want to go back.’
He was almost at the door when Robin said,
‘Will, your mother’s dead. You know that, don’t you?’
Will turned back, glaring at her, his thin chest rising and falling rapidly. Robin felt she had no choice but to resort to dirty tactics, but it wrung her heart, nonetheless.
‘You looked it up online, didn’t you? Didn’t you?’
Will nodded.
‘You know how much I risked at Chapman Farm, by telling you that. You heard them talking about me after I left, and you found out my real name, and tracked me down to exactly where I should have been, at our office. I’m not lying to you. Flora was a church member, but she got out. Please, just sit down and talk to her for a bit. I’ll drive you back to Pat’s afterwards.’
After almost a full minute of deliberation, Will returned reluctantly to his chair.
‘I know how you feel, Will,’ said Flora unexpectedly, in a timid voice. ‘I do, honestly.’
‘Why are you still alive?’ said Will brutally.
‘I wonder myself, sometimes,’ said Flora with a shaky little laugh.
Robin was starting to fear this meeting was going to do both parties more harm than good. She looked at Prudence for help, and the latter said,
‘Are you wondering why the Drowned Prophet hasn’t come for Flora, Will?’
‘Yes, obviously,’ said Will, refusing to look at Prudence, whose offences of possessing snuff bottles and antique rugs were apparently too severe for him to overlook.
‘The Drowned Prophet kind of did come for me. I’m not supposed to drink on my meds,’ said Flora, with a guilty glance at Prudence, ‘and I’m try not to, but if I do, I start feeling like the prophet’s watching me again, and I can hear her telling me I’m not fit to live. But nowadays I know the voice isn’t real.’
‘How?’ demanded Will.
‘Because she hates all the things I hate about myself,’ said Flora, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. ‘I know it’s me doing it, not her.’
‘How did you get out?’
‘I wasn’t very well.’
‘I don’t believe you. ‘They wouldn’t have let you go just for that. They’d have treated you.’
‘They did treat me, kind of. They made me chant in the temple, and gave me some herbs, and Papa J –’ A look of disgust flickered across Flora’s half-concealed face ‘– but none of it worked. I was seeing things and hearing voices. In the end, they contacted my dad and he came and picked me up.’
‘You’re lying. They wouldn’t do that. They’d never contact a flesh object.’
‘They didn’t know what else to do with me, I don’t think,’ said Flora. ‘My dad was really angry. He said it was all my own fault for running away and causing a load of trouble and not answering letters. Once we got home, he was really pissed off with me chanting and doing the joyful meditation. He thought it was me trying to stay in the religion… he didn’t understand that I couldn’t stop… I could see the Drowned Prophet standing behind doors and sometimes I’d see her reflection in the bathroom mirror, right behind me, and I’d turn around but she’d be gone. I didn’t tell Dad or my stepmum, because the Drowned Prophet told me not to – I mean, I thought she told me not to…’
‘How d’you know it wasn’t the Drowned Prophet?’ said Will.
Robin was starting to feel that this had all been a terrible mistake. She hadn’t dreamed that Will would attempt to re-indoctrinate Flora, and she turned to look at Prudence, hoping she’d shut this conversation down, but Prudence was merely listening with a neutral expression on her face.
‘Because she stopped appearing, after I got treatment, but it was ages before I saw a doctor, because my dad and my stepmum kept saying I had to either reapply to uni or get a job, so I was supposed to be filling out application forms and things, but I couldn’t concentrate… and there were things I couldn’t tell them…
‘I had a baby there and she died. She was born dead. The cord was wrapped around her neck.’
‘Oh God,’ said Robin, unable to contain herself. She was back in the dormitory, blood everywhere, helping to deliver Wan’s breech baby.
‘They punished me for it,’ said Flora with a little sob. ‘They said it was my fault. They said I killed the baby, by being bad. I couldn’t tell Dad and my stepmum things like that. I never told anyone about the baby at all, until I started seeing Prudence. For a long time, I didn’t know if I’d really had a baby or not… but later… much later… I went to a doctor for an examination. And I said to her, “Have I given birth?” And she thought it was a very weird question, obviously, but she said yes. She could tell. By feeling.’
Flora swallowed, then continued,
‘I spoke to a journalist after I left, but I didn’t tell him about the baby, either. I knew the Drowned Prophet might kill me if I talked to him, but I was desperate and I wanted people to know how bad the church was. I thought, maybe if Dad and my stepmum read my interview in the papers, they’d understand better what I’d been through, and forgive me. So I met the journalist and told him some things, and that night the Drowned Prophet came, and she was floating outside my window, and she told me to kill myself, because I’d betrayed everyone in the church. So I called the journalist and told him she’d come for me, and to write the story, and then I slit my wrists in the bathroom.’
‘I’m so sorry,’ said Robin, but Flora gave no sign she’d heard her.
‘Then my dad broke down the bathroom door and I got taken to hospital and they diagnosed psychosis and I got admitted to a mental ward. I was in there for ages, and they gave me tons of meds and I had to see the psychiatrist, like, five times a week, but in the end I stopped seeing the Drowned Prophet.
‘After I got out of hospital, I went to New Zealand. My aunt and uncle are in business, in Wellington. They sort of made up a job for me…’
Flora’s voice trailed away.
‘And you never saw the prophet again?’ said Will.
Angry at him for maintaining his inquisitorial tone after everything Flora had just told them, Robin muttered ‘Will!’ but Flora answered.
‘No, I did. I mean, it wasn’t really her – it was my fault. I was smoking a lot of weed in New Zealand and it all started up again. I ended up in another psychiatric hospital for months, and after that my aunt and uncle put me back on a plane to London. They’d had enough of me. They didn’t want the responsibility.
‘But I’ve never seen her again, since New Zealand,’ said Flora. ‘Except, like I say, sometimes if I drink I think I can hear her again… but I know she’s not real.’
‘If you really thought she wasn’t real, you’d have been to the police.’
‘Will—’ said Robin, and was ignored.
‘I know she’s real, and she’s going to come for me,’ Will continued, with a kind of desperate bravado, ‘but I’m still going to turn myself in. So either you do believe in her, and you’re scared, or you don’t want the church exposed.’
‘I do want them exposed,’ said Flora vehemently. ‘That’s why I spoke to the journalist and why I said I’d meet you. You don’t understand,’ she said, starting to sob. ‘I feel guilty all the time. I know I’m a coward, but I’m afraid—’
‘Of the Drowned Prophet,’ said Will triumphantly. ‘There you are. You know she’s real.’
‘There are more things to be frightened of than the Drowned Prophet!’ said Flora shrilly.
‘What – like jail?’ said Will dismissively. ‘I know I’m going to jail, if she doesn’t kill me first. I don’t care, it’s the right thing to do.’
‘Will, I’ve already told you this: there’s no need for either of you to go to jail,’ said Robin. Turning to Flora, she said, ‘We believe immunity from prosecution could be arranged if you were prepared to testify against the church, Flora. Everything you’ve just described shows clearly how traumatised you were by what happened to you at Chapman Farm. You had good and valid reasons for not speaking.’
‘I tried to tell people,’ said Flora desperately. ‘I told my psychiatrists the worst thing and they said it was part of my psychosis, that I was imagining it, that it was all part of my hallucinations of the prophet. It’s so long ago, now… everyone will blame me, like him,’ she added hopelessly, jabbing a finger at Will. Now that she wasn’t holding her cuff over her hand, Robin glimpsed the ugly scars on her wrist where she’d tried to end her life.
‘What things did you tell your psychiatrists?’ said Will implacably. ‘The Divine Secrets?’
Robin now remembered Shawna talking about Divine Secrets. She’d never found out what they were.
‘No,’ admitted Flora.
‘So you weren’t really telling them anything,’ said Will scornfully. ‘If you were convinced there’s no Drowned Prophet, you’d have talked about all that.’
‘I told them the worst thing!’ said Flora wildly. ‘And when they didn’t believe that, I knew there’d be no point talking about the Divine Secrets!’
Robin could tell by the look on Prudence’s face that she didn’t know what these secrets were, either.
‘You don’t know everything I saw,’ Flora said to Will, and there was a trace of anger in her voice now. ‘You weren’t there. I drew it,’ she said, turning to Robin, ‘because there were other witnesses, too, and I thought, if any of them had left, they might see the picture and contact me. Then I’d know for sure it was real, but all I got—’
‘Was my partner,’ said Robin.
‘Yes,’ said Flora, ‘and I knew from the way he wrote he’d never been in the UHC. You wouldn’t talk like that, if you had. “You really don’t like the UHC, do you?” You wouldn’t be that… casual. Then I thought it might be someone from Deirdre’s family, trying to goad me, and I felt… so guilty… so scared, I deleted my account.’
‘Who’s Deirdre?’ said Will.
‘Lin’s mother,’ said Robin.
For the first time, Will looked taken aback.
‘Flora,’ Robin said, ‘can I tell you what I think you saw?’
Slowly and carefully, Robin described the scene in the temple she believed had taken place during the Manifestation of the Drowned Prophet, in which Deirdre had been taken out of the pool, dead. When she’d finished speaking, Flora, whose breathing was shallow and whose face was very white, whispered,
‘How do you know that?’
‘I worked it out,’ said Robin. ‘I was there for one of the Manifestations. They nearly drowned me. But how did they explain what had happened? How did they get away with telling everyone Deirdre had left?’
‘When they took her out of the pool,’ said Flora haltingly, ‘it was still very dark. Dr Zhou bent over her and said, “She’s all right, she’s breathing.” Papa J told everyone to leave, the younger ones first. As we were filing out, Papa J was pretending to talk to Deirdre, acting as if they were having a conversation, as though her voice was very quiet but he could hear it.
‘But I knew she was dead,’ said Flora. ‘I was close to the stage. I saw her face when they pulled her out of the pool. There was foam on her lips. Her eyes were open. I knew. But you had to believe what Papa J and Mazu said. You had to. Next day, they gathered us together and said Deirdre had been expelled, and everyone just – they just accepted it. I heard people saying “Of course they had to expel her, if she’d displeased the prophet like that.”
‘I remember this boy called Kevin. It should have been his first Manifestation, but he was being punished, so he wasn’t allowed to attend. He asked a lot of questions about what Deirdre had done to be expelled, and I remember Becca – she was a teenager, one of Papa J’s spirit wives – hitting him round the head and telling him to shut up about Deirdre… Becca was the one who made me… who made me…’
‘What did Becca make you do?’ Robin asked.
When Flora shook her head, looking down into her lap, Robin said,
‘Becca made me do things, too. She also tried to get me into terrible trouble, hiding something stolen under my bed. I think she’s nearly as scary as the Waces, personally.’
Flora looked up at Robin for the first time.
‘Me too,’ she whispered.
‘What did she make you do? Something that might make you complicit in an awful situation? They did the same thing to me, sent me to look after a dying boy. I knew that if he died while I was with him, they’d blame me.’
‘That’s worse,’ said Flora faintly, and Robin was touched to see genuine sympathy for her on Flora’s face. ‘That’s worse than mine… they did do it to make me complicit, I’ve often thought that… Becca made me type letters from Deirdre, to her family. I had to make them up myself. I had to write that I’d left the farm but I wanted a new life, away from my husband and children… so obviously Deirdre was dead,’ said Flora in frustration, ‘but Becca looked me in the eye and told me she was alive, and she’d been expelled, even while she was making me write those letters!’
‘I think that’s a big part of what they do,’ said Robin. ‘They force you to agree black’s white and up’s down. It’s part of the way they control you.’
‘But that’s fraud, isn’t it?’ said Flora desperately. ‘They made me part of the cover-up!’
‘You were being coerced,’ said Robin. ‘I’m certain you’d get immunity, Flora.’
‘Is Becca still there?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin and Will together. The latter wore an odd, arrested expression now; he’d followed the story of the fake letters closely.
‘Has Becca ever increased?’ asked Flora.
‘No,’ said Will.
Now, for the first time, he volunteered information rather than demanding it.
‘Papa J doesn’t want to, because he thinks her bloodline’s tainted.’
‘That’s not why he won’t let her have a baby,’ said Flora quietly.
‘Why, then?’
‘He wants to keep her a virgin,’ said Flora. ‘That’s why Mazu doesn’t hate on her, like she does with all the other spirit wives.’
‘I didn’t know that,’ said Will, very surprised.
‘All the spirit wives know,’ said Flora. ‘I was one of them,’ she added.
‘Really?’ said Robin.
‘Yes,’ said Flora. ‘It started as the Loving Cure, and he liked it so much he made me a spirit wife. He likes… he likes it when you don’t like it.’
Robin’s thoughts flew immediately to Deirdre Doherty, the prim woman who’d wished to remain faithful to her husband, and whose last pregnancy, she believed, was the result of Wace’s rape.
‘Mazu sometimes joined in,’ said Flora, in a near whisper. ‘She’d… sometimes, she’d help hold me down, or… sometimes he likes to watch her do stuff to you…’
‘Oh God,’ said Robin. ‘Flora… I’m so sorry.’
Will now looked both scared and disturbed. Twice, he opened his mouth to speak, changed his mind, then blurted out,
‘How d’you explain the things the prophet does at Chapman Farm, if she’s not real, though?’
‘Like, what kind of things?’ said Flora.
‘The Manifestations.’
‘You mean, like, in the pool and in the woods?’
‘I know they use little girls, dressed up like her, in the woods, I’m not stupid,’ said Will. ‘But that doesn’t mean they don’t become her, when they’re doing it.’
‘What do you mean by that, Will?’ asked Prudence.
‘Well, it’s like transubstantiation, isn’t it?’ said Will. He might have been back on the vegetable patch again, lecturing Robin on church doctrine. ‘The wafer they give you in communion isn’t really the body of Christ, but it is. Same thing. And that dummy thing they make rise up out of the baptismal pool, it’s just symbolic. It’s not her, but it is her.’
‘Is that one of the Higher-Level Truths?’ Robin asked. ‘That the little girls dressed up like Daiyu, and the dummy without eyes, are Daiyu?’
‘Don’t call her Daiyu,’ said Will angrily. ‘It’s disrespectful. And no,’ he added, ‘I worked that stuff out for myself.’
He seemed to feel he needed to justify himself, because he said forcefully,
‘Look, I know a lot of it’s bullshit. I saw the hypocrisy, how Papa J gets to do stuff nobody else is allowed to – he can marry, and he gets to keep his kids and his grandkids because his bloodline’s special, and everyone else has got to make the Living Sacrifice, and the alcohol in the farmhouse, and the smarming around celebrities even though that’s all supposed to be bullshit – I know Papa J’s not a messiah, and that they do really bad things at that farm, but you can’t say they haven’t got something right, because you’ve seen it,’ he said to Flora, ‘and you have too!’ he added to Robin. ‘The spirit world’s real!’
There was a short silence, broken by Prudence.
‘Why d’you think nobody in the church ever admits they dress up little girls at night, and use a dummy to rise up out of the baptismal pool, Will? Because a lot of people believe they’re literally seeing something supernatural, don’t they?’
‘Some of them might,’ said Will defensively, ‘but not all of them. Anyway, the Drowned Prophet does come back for real. She materialises out of thin air!’
‘But if the other things are a trick…’ suggested Flora.
‘That doesn’t follow. Yeah, OK, sometimes they’re just showing us representations of the prophet, but other times, she genuinely comes… it’s like, in churches, having a model of Jesus on the wall. Nobody’s pretending it’s literally him. But when the Drowned Prophet appears as a spirit, and moves around and everything – there’s no other explanation for it. There’s no projector, and she’s not a puppet – it’s her, it’s really her.’
‘Are you talking about when she manifests like a ghost, in the basement room?’ asked Robin.
‘Not just in the basement,’ said Will. ‘She does it in the temple, too.’
‘Is the audience always sitting in the dark when that happens?’ asked Robin. ‘And do they sometimes make you clear the room before she appears? They made us leave the basement for a while before we saw her manifest. Is the audience always in front of her when she manifests, not sitting round the stage?’
‘Yeah, it was always like that,’ said Flora, when Will didn’t answer. ‘Why?’
‘Because I might be able to explain how they do it,’ said Robin. ‘A man I work with suggested it could be an old illusion called Pepper’s ghost. I looked it up. You need a glass screen, which is at an angle to the audience, and a hidden side room. Then a figure in the side room is slightly illuminated, and the lights on stage go down, and the audience sees the reflection of the supposed ghost in the glass, and it’s transparent and looks as though it’s onstage.’
Silence followed these words. Then, startling everyone in the room, Flora said loudly,
‘Oh my God.’
The other three looked at her. Flora was gazing through her hair at Robin in what appeared to be awe.
‘That’s it. That’s how they do it. Oh. My. God.’
Flora began to laugh.
‘I can’t believe it!’ she said breathlessly. ‘I’ve never been able to work that one out, it’s always been the one that made me doubt… a reflection on glass – that’s it, that makes total sense! They only ever did it where there was a side room. And if we were in temple, we all had to sit face-on to the stage.’
‘I think,’ said Robin, ‘the temple at Chapman Farm was designed like a theatre. That upper balcony where members never sit, those recesses… I think it’s been constructed to enable large-scale illusions.’
‘You can’t be sure of that,’ said Will, who now appeared deeply uneasy.
‘The Drowned Prophet isn’t real,’ Flora told Will. ‘She’s not.’
‘If you honestly believed that,’ said Will, with a trace of his former anger, ‘if you genuinely believed it, you’d reveal the Divine Secrets.’
‘You mean, the Dragon Meadow? The Living Sacrifice? The Loving Cure?’
Will glanced nervously towards the window, as though he expected the eyeless Daiyu to be floating there.
‘If I speak about them now, and I don’t die, will you believe she’s not real?’ said Flora.
Flora had shaken the hair out of her face now. She was revealed as a beautiful woman. Will didn’t answer her question. He looked frightened.
‘The Dragon Meadow is the place they bury all the bodies,’ said Flora in a clear voice. ‘It’s that field the horses are always ploughing.’
Will emitted a little gasp of shock, but Flora kept talking.
