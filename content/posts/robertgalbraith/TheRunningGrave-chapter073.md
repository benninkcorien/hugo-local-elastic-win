The Running Grave
73
We find ourselves close to the commander of darkness…
The I Ching or Book of Changes
‘I haven’t finished,’ said Robin stupidly, pointing at the floor, which was still faintly pink.
‘I’ll send someone else to do it,’ said Louise. She was holding her hands in front of her, nervously interlocking her swollen-jointed fingers. ‘You’d better come.’
It took a moment for Robin to make her trembling legs behave. She followed Louise out of the bathroom and through the deserted dormitory. For a brief moment, she contemplated breaking away, sprinting down the passage between the dormitories and climbing over the five-bar gate, but she had no confidence that she’d make the woods without being caught: there were too many people in the courtyard, some of them grouped around Daiyu’s pool to make the usual obeisance, others heading for the dining hall.
Louise and Robin, too, paused at the pool. When Robin said, ‘The Drowned Prophet will bless all who worship her,’ she felt her tongue sticking to the roof of her mouth. Having daubed her forehead with water, she followed Louise towards the dragon-carved doors of the farmhouse.
Inside, they passed the scarlet-carpeted staircase, then stopped at a shiny black door on the left-hand side of the hall. Louise knocked.
‘Come,’ said Jonathan Wace’s voice.
Louise opened the door, indicated that Robin should walk inside and then closed the door behind her.
The room Robin entered was large and very beautiful. Unlike Mazu’s study, there was no clutter here. The walls were covered in peacock blue fabric, against which figures of ivory and silver, most of them Chinese, stood in graceful, modern shelving cabinets, in pools of carefully directed light. A fire burned beneath a modern surround of white marble. In front of this, on a black leather couch, sat Jonathan Wace, alone, eating off a low black lacquer table that was laden with various dishes.
‘Aha,’ said Wace, smiling as he set down his knife and fork and got to his feet. ‘Rowena.’
He was wearing an upmarket version of the white tracksuits nearly everyone at the farm wore, which appeared to be made of raw silk. On his feet he wore very expensive-looking leather slides. Robin felt the colour leave her face as he walked towards her.
Wace pulled her into a hug. Robin could still feel herself shaking, and knew he could feel it too, because he was holding her so tightly her breasts were squashed against his chest. He smelled of sandalwood cologne and held her far too long for her comfort. She tried to relax, but every muscle was tense. At last Wace loosened his grip, though still holding her in his arms, so he could look down at her, smiling.
‘You’re quite wonderful, aren’t you?’
Robin didn’t know whether he was being sarcastic. He looked sincere. At last, he released her.
‘Come,’ he said again, and returned to the sofa, beckoning her to a black leather chair that sat at right angles to the fire.
‘I’ve heard how you helped deliver Mazu’s baby, Rowena,’ said Wace. ‘Thank you, very sincerely, for your service.’
Momentarily confused, Robin realised he was talking about Wan’s daughter.
‘Oh,’ she said. Her mouth was still so dry it was hard to get out the words. ‘Yes.’
‘And tonight you offered poor little Lin solace,’ said Wace, still smiling as he added ragout to his plate. ‘You are forgiven,’ he added, ‘for speaking intemperately to Dr Zhou.’
‘I… oh good… I mean, thank you,’ said Robin.
She felt certain Wace was playing some kind of game. The smell of rich food, coming as it did immediately after the smell of blood, was making her stomach churn. Breathe, she told herself. Talk.
‘Is Lin going to be all right?’ she asked.
‘“The way of yang goes to and fro, up and down,”’ quoted Wace, still smiling. ‘She’s been foolish, as you’ve probably realised. Why didn’t you tell anyone she was consuming mugwort?’ he asked, apparently idly, as he picked up his knife and fork again.
‘I didn’t know,’ said Robin, as sweat broke out over her scalp again. ‘I guessed. I saw her with some plants a while ago.’
‘When was this?’
‘I can’t remember, I just saw her holding them one day. When I saw that rash she’s got tonight, I thought it looked like an allergy.’
‘There are no allergies,’ said Wace smoothly. ‘The rash was her flesh revolting at what her false self made her do.’
‘Will Dr Zhou be able to help her?’
‘Of course. He understands spirit work better than anyone now alive.’
‘Has he taken her to a hospital?’
‘He’s treating her now, and Taio’s about to remove her to a place of recuperation, so you needn’t distress yourself about Lin,’ said Wace. ‘I want to talk about you. I hear… conflicting reports.’
He smiled at her, chewing, then, widening his eyes, he swallowed and said,
‘But this is shocking of me… you’re missing dinner.’
He pressed a small bell sitting among the various dishes on the table. Moments later, bald Shawna appeared, beaming.
‘Shawna, another plate, glass, knife and fork for Rowena, please,’ said Wace.
‘Yes, Papa J,’ said Shawna importantly, bowing before leaving the room again.
‘Thank you,’ said Robin, trying to act the part of an innocent woman and church member, one who desperately wanted Jonathan Wace’s approval. ‘Sorry, but… what conflicting reports are there about me?’
‘Well,’ said Wace, ‘I’m told you’re a very hard worker. You never complain of tiredness. You show resourcefulness and courage – the labour was long, I hear, and you forwent sleep to help. You also found our Emily in Norwich when she was taken ill, didn’t you? And I believe you previously rushed to her defence when Jiang was giving her instructions. Then, tonight, you were the first to go to Lin’s aid. I think I’ll have to call you Artemis. You know who Artemis is?’
‘Um… the Greek goddess of hunting?’
‘Hunting,’ repeated Jonathan. ‘Interesting you speak of hunting, first.’
‘Only because I’ve seen statues of her with a bow and arrow,’ said Robin, who was pressing her hands between her knees to stop them shaking. ‘I don’t really know much else about her.’
The door opened and Shawna reappeared with everything Wace had asked for. She laid out a plate, knife, fork and glass in front of Robin, bowed again to Wace, beaming, and disappeared, closing the door behind her.
‘Eat,’ Wace ordered Robin, filling her water glass himself. ‘There are many contradictions in Artemis, as in so many human representations of the divine. She’s a huntress, but also protector of the hunted, of girls up to marriageable age, the goddess of childbirth and… strangely… of chastity.’
He glanced at her before turning his attention back to his food. Robin took a gulp of water, trying to ease the dryness of her mouth.
‘Personally,’ Wace continued, ‘I don’t disdain the teachings of those whom conventional religious people would see as pagans. I don’t believe the Christian conception of God is any more valid than the ancient Greeks’. All subjective attempts to draw a complete picture of the Blessed Divinity are necessarily partial and flawed.’
Except yours, thought Robin. She’d served herself ragout and polenta, and now took a mouthful. It was one of the best things she’d ever eaten, or perhaps it was simply that she’d been deprived of real food for so long.
‘And you’ve been generous to the church, Artemis,’ said Wace. ‘A thousand pounds! Thank you,’ he said, making his familiar expression of humility and gratitude, as he pressed one hand to his heart.
‘I should have made that sooner,’ said Robin.
‘Why d’you say that?’ Wace asked, eyebrows raised.
‘Because I know other people donated before me. I should have—’
‘There is no “should have”,’ said Wace. ‘All that counts is what is done. The journey to pure spirit is essentially a process of becoming ever more active. Prayer, meditation, study: these are actions. Regret is inactive and useful only in so far as it propels us onwards, to more action. So, all of this is very good, but,’ said Wace, his smile now fading, ‘your journal is… a little disappointing.’
Robin’s heart beat faster. When it came to her journal, she’d taken a line from what Niamh Doherty had told her: one thing enjoyed, one thing learned, every day.
‘No questions,’ said Wace. ‘No doubts. Certainly no indication of Rowena’s inner life.’
‘I was trying not to show egomotivity,’ said Robin.
Wace let out a bark of laughter that made her jump.
‘That’s exactly what I expected you to say, Artemis.’
Robin disliked the repetition of the new nickname. She knew it was meant both to flatter and destabilise her.
‘And I hear you’re the same way in doctrinal lectures. You never seek discussion or clarification. You’re studious, but silent. No curiosity.’
‘I thought—’
‘—that would show egomotivity? Not at all. It’s a maxim of mine that I’d rather face an honest sceptic than a hundred who believe they know God but are really in thrall to their own piety. But it interests me, this lack of curiosity and argument, because you’re not a submissive, are you? Not really. You’ve shown that repeatedly.’
As Robin struggled for an answer, she heard movement outside the room, a scuffling and then the sound of Lin’s voice.
‘I d-d-don’t want to g-g-go – no! N-n-n-no!’
‘Music,’ said Wace, setting down his knife and fork with a clatter, getting to his feet and moving calmly to a discreet panel on the wall. With the press of a button, classical music filled the room. Robin heard the front doors of the farmhouse slam. She had time to remember that Lin was almost certainly Wace’s own daughter before he moved back to the sofa and said, as though nothing had happened,
‘So I’m puzzled by you, Artemis. On the one hand, passivity, unquestioning obedience, an uncomplaining work ethic, a journal that asks no questions, a large donation to the church.
‘But on the other hand, a strong and dynamic individuality. Outside of doctrinal seminars, you challenge authority and resist deeper engagement with the church’s precepts. You demonstrate a strong materialist adherence to the importance of the body, over the requirements of the spirit. Why these contradictions, Artemis?’
Robin, who felt slightly stronger for the ingestion of food and water, said,
‘I’m trying to learn and change. I was argumentative before I joined the church. That’s why my fiancé broke up with me. I suppose… my false self is still there, still clinging on.’
‘A very nice, neat, pat answer,’ said Wace, smiling again.
‘I’m trying to be honest,’ said Robin. She wondered whether crying would help convince Wace of her sincerity. It wouldn’t take much for the tears to flow, after the shocks of the last hour.
‘I hear,’ said Wace, ‘the only time you seemed to show any interest in challenging church doctrine was with young Will, up at the vegetable patch.’
‘I wasn’t challenging him,’ said Robin, careful not to sound defensive. ‘I made a mistake and he corrected me. Several times, actually.’
‘Ah, well… Will’s better at memorising doctrine than living it,’ said Wace, smiling again. ‘He’s a clever young man, but hasn’t yet made pure spirit because he falters, constantly, at step six. You know what step six is?’
‘“The pure spirit knows acceptance is more important than understanding,”’ quoted Robin.
‘Very good,’ said Wace. ‘The materialist seeks understanding, where the pure spirit seeks truth. Where the materialist sees contradictions, the pure spirit grasps that disparate notions and ideas are all part of the whole, which only the Divinity can comprehend. Will cannot rid himself of adherence to a materialist conception of knowledge. He tries, he seems to succeed, but then he falls back again.’
Wace scanned Robin’s face, but she said nothing, certain that showing a particular interest in Will would be dangerous. When it became clear that she wasn’t going to speak, Wace went on,
‘And you challenged Jiang when he was instructing Emily, also on the vegetable patch.’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, ‘I reacted instinctively, I was—’
‘“Instinctively”,’ repeated Wace, ‘is an interesting choice of word, and a great favourite of materialists. Only when mankind has rid itself of the base emotions we call “instinct” are we likely to win our battle against evil. But your – to use your word – “instinct” seems to be particularly engaged by Disruptives, Artemis.’
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Robin.
‘Will. Emily. Even quiet little Lin has her Disruptive tendencies,’ said Wace.
‘I barely know any of them,’ said Robin.
Wace said nothing for a few moments. He cleaned his plate then dabbed at his mouth with a linen napkin before saying,
‘Your Revelation was difficult, I hear. Daiyu manifested.’
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘She does that,’ said Wace, ‘when she feels the church is under threat.’
He looked at Robin, no longer smiling, and she forced herself to look back at him, to school her features into a look of confusion rather than panic. His large, dark blue eyes were opaque.
‘You… can’t think I’m a threat to the church?’
The words came out as a whisper, which wasn’t feigned. Robin’s throat felt constricted.
‘Well, let’s see,’ said Wace, without smiling. ‘Stand up for me.’
Robin let her knife and fork fall to her plate and stood up.
‘Here,’ said Wace, moving away from the sofa to a patch of clear carpet in the middle of the room.
Now they faced each other. Robin didn’t know what was coming: sometimes Becca or Mazu led them in simple yoga movements as part of their meditations, and Wace stood as though about to give physical instructions.
After staring at her dispassionately for ten seconds, he reached out and placed his hands on her breasts, his eyes boring into hers. Robin stood stock still, feeling nothing but shock. She seemed to be watching from outside her own body, barely feeling Wace caressing her.
‘Spirit is all that matters,’ said Wace. ‘The body is immaterial. Do you agree?’
Robin said ‘yes’ automatically, or tried to do so, but no sound issued from her mouth.
Wace removed his right hand from her breast, placed it between her legs and began to rub.
At the exact moment Robin jumped backwards, the door behind her opened. She and Wace both turned, his hand falling from her breast. Becca and Mazu entered the room, the former in her white tracksuit, the latter wearing long white robes, a witch bride with her long black hair. With the door open, baby Yixin could be heard crying from upstairs.
It would have been hard to say which woman looked more furious and outraged. Neither Mazu nor Becca seemed to have learned the lesson of materialist possession: both, it was clear, were incensed to find Wace’s hands upon Robin. After a few frozen moments of silence, Becca said in a high, cold voice:
‘Giles has a query.’
‘Then send him in. You may go, Artemis,’ said Wace, entirely relaxed and now smiling again.
‘Thank you,’ said Robin.
She smelled Mazu’s particular odour of grime and incense as she passed the two furious women. Down the hall Robin hurried, the baby wailing overhead, her mind a hum of panic, her body burning where Wace had touched her, as though he’d branded her through her clothes.
Run, now.
But they’ll see me on the cameras.
Robin pushed through the dragon-carved doors. The sun was sinking bloodily in the sky. People were criss-crossing the courtyard, busy about their after-dinner tasks. Robin headed automatically for Daiyu’s pool, its dimpled surface glittering like rubies in the sunset, the constant patter of the fountain in her ears.
‘The Drowned Prophet will bless—’
But Robin couldn’t get the words out. Knowing she was going to vomit and not caring whether she drew curious eyes, she set off at a run towards the dormitory where she just made one of the toilets, where she threw up the small amount of ragout and polenta she’d swallowed with Jonathan Wace, then fell to her knees to dry-heave, her flesh clammy with revulsion.
