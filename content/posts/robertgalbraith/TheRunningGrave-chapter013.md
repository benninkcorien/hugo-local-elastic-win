The Running Grave
13
Nine at the beginning means:
The footprints run crisscross.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
The extreme taciturnity of Clive Littlejohn, the agency’s newest subcontractor, was starting to grate on people other than Robin.
‘There’s something wrong wi’ him,’ Littlejohn’s fellow subcontractor, Barclay, told Robin on Wednesday morning, as both sat watching the entrance to a block of flats in Bexleyheath from Barclay’s car.
‘Better him than Morris or Nutley,’ said Robin, loyally parroting Strike’s line.
‘That’s a low fuckin’ bar,’ said Barclay.
‘He’s doing the job OK,’ said Robin.
‘He just fuckin’ stares,’ said Barclay. ‘Doesn’t blink. Like a fuckin’ lizard.’
‘I’m pretty sure lizards blink,’ said Robin. ‘Wait – is that one of them?’
‘No,’ said Barclay, leaning forwards to squint through the windscreen at a man who’d just exited the building. ‘He’s fatter than ours.’
Inside the block of flats they were watching lived two brothers in their forties who, unfortunately for the agency’s newest investigation, closely resembled each other. One of them – a few days’ surveillance hadn’t yet identified which – was stalking an actress called Tasha Mayo. The police weren’t taking the matter seriously enough for the client, who was starting to become, in her own words, ‘freaked out’. A series of trivial incidents, at first merely irksome, had lately turned sinister with the posting of a dead bird through the woman’s letter box, and then with the gluing up of the keyhole on her front door.
‘I mean, I know the police are overstretched,’ Tasha had told Robin, while the latter was taking down the details of the case at the office. ‘I get that, and I know there’s been no direct threat, but I’ve told them who I think’s doing it, I’ve given them a physical description and where he lives and everything, because he’s told me most of his life story in segments. He’s always hanging around the stage door and I’ve signed about fifteen posters and bits of paper. Things turned nasty when I told him I hadn’t got time for another selfie. And he keeps turning up places I go. I just want it to stop. Someone keyed my car last night. I’ve had enough. I need you to catch him in the act.’
This wasn’t the first stalking case the agency had tackled, but none had yet involved dead birds, and Robin, who felt sympathetic towards the client, was hoping to catch the perpetrator sooner rather than later.
‘Midge fancies her,’ said Barclay, watching the suspect’s window.
‘Who, Tasha Mayo?’
‘Aye. Did ye see that film she was in, about those two Victorian lesbians?’
‘No. Was it good?’
‘Fuckin’ dreadful,’ said Barclay. ‘Hour and a half of poetry and gardening. The wife loved it. I didn’t, because apparently I’m an insensitive prick.’
Robin laughed.
‘Midge could be in with a shot,’ Barclay went on. ‘Tasha Mayo’s bisexual.’
‘Is she?’
‘According to the wife. That’d be the wife’s specialist subject on Mastermind: sex lives o’ the stars. She’s a walking fuckin’ encyclopaedia on it.’
They sat in silence for a few minutes before Barclay, still staring up at the fourth floor, asked,
‘Why aren’t they working for a living?’
‘No idea,’ said Robin.
‘Be handy if we could nail them on a benefits scam. Nice bit o’ community service. He wouldn’t have time tae go after her, then.’
‘Community service would end eventually,’ said Robin, sipping her coffee. ‘Trouble is, I don’t know how you stop someone being obsessed.’
‘Punch them?’ suggested Barclay, and after a moment’s thought he added, ‘D’ye think Littlejohn’d say something if I punched him?’
‘Maybe try and find a topic of mutual interest first,’ said Robin.
‘It’s fuckin’ bizarre,’ said Barclay, ‘never talking. Just sitting there.’
‘That’s one of them,’ Robin said, replacing her coffee in the cupholder.
A man had just left the building, walking with his hands in his pockets. Like his brother, he had an unusually high forehead, which was why Barclay had nicknamed the pair the Frankenstein brothers, which had been swiftly abbreviated to Frank One and Frank Two. Shabbily dressed in an old windcheater, jeans and trainers, he was heading, Robin guessed, towards the station.
‘OK, I’ll take him,’ she said, picking up the backpack she usually took on surveillance, ‘and you can stay here and watch the other one.’
‘Aye, all right,’ said Barclay. ‘Good luck.’
Robin, who was wearing a beanie hat to cover her distinctive new haircut, followed Frank One on foot to Bexleyheath station and, after a short wait, got into the same train compartment, where she kept him under covert observation from several seats away.
After a couple of minutes, Robin’s mobile rang and she saw Strike’s number.
‘Morning. Where are you?’
‘With one of the Franks,’ she said quietly. ‘We’re heading into London.’
‘Ah. Well, I just wanted to tell you, I’ve persuaded that journalist I mentioned to talk to me. Fergus Robertson, meeting him later at the Westminster Arms. Have you read his article yet?’
‘Yes,’ said Robin, ‘and I read his follow-up, too, about what the church did to him after the first one was published. They don’t like criticism, do they?’
‘I’d say that’s an understatement,’ said Strike. ‘In other news, I’ve just spotted Will Edensor. He’s collecting in Soho again today.’
‘Oh wow, really?’
‘Yeah. I didn’t approach him, just to be on the safe side, but he looks bloody terrible. He’s over six foot tall and probably weighs less than you do.’
‘Did he look happy? All the temple attendants were beaming non-stop.’
‘No, definitely not happy. I’ve also got Pat to have a look at the rota. You could go up to Coventry in the latter half of next week, if that suits you. I’ve got Sheila Kennett’s number – the old woman who lived at Chapman Farm for years. If I text it to you, could you ring her? See whether she’d be amenable to an interview?’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Robin.
She’d barely returned her phone to her pocket when it rang again: Ilsa.
‘Hi,’ said Robin, ‘what’s up?’
‘What the hell is he playing at?’ said Ilsa hotly.
‘What’s who playing at?’
‘Corm!’
‘I don’t—’
‘He’s slept with bloody Bijou Watkins! Well – I say “slept” – apparently it was standing up, against her bedroom wall.’
Robin realised she was gaping, and closed her mouth.
‘He – hasn’t mentioned it to me.’
‘No, I’ll bet he bloody hasn’t,’ said Ilsa angrily. ‘She made up some bullshit reason to get his number off me, and I couldn’t think of any way of not giving it to her, but I thought he’d have the sense, after meeting her and seeing what she’s like, of not going within a hundred miles of her. You need to warn him: she’s insane. She can’t keep her bloody mouth shut, half of Chambers will have heard all the details by now—’
‘Ilsa, I can’t tell him who to sleep with. Or shag standing up against a bedroom wall,’ Robin added.
‘But she’s a total nutcase! All she wants is a rich husband and a baby, she’s completely open about it!’
‘Strike’s not rich,’ said Robin.
‘She might not realise that, after all those high-profile cases he keeps solving. You’ve got to warn him—’
‘Ilsa, I can’t. You warn him, if you want to. His sex life’s hardly my business.’
Ilsa groaned.
‘But why her, if he wants a displacement fuck?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Robin, completely honestly, and then, dropping her voice, she asked, ‘and what d’you mean, a “displacement fuck”?’
‘Oh, please,’ said Ilsa irritably. ‘You know perfectly well what—shit, that’s my QC, I’ll have to go. Bye.’
This conversation left Robin watching Frank One’s reflection in the dirty train window, prey to many conflicting emotions she wasn’t sure she wanted to disentangle. A very vivid mental picture had presented itself to her while Ilsa talked, of Bijou in her shocking pink dress, long tanned legs wrapped around Strike, and it wasn’t immediately possible to erase the image, especially as her imagination had given Strike quite a hairy arse.
The train stopped at last at Waterloo East. Robin followed her target on foot and then onto a Tube train, where he disembarked at Piccadilly Circus.
They were now so close to Theatreland that Robin’s hopes were rising that she’d picked the right brother to follow. However, instead of heading towards Shaftesbury Avenue and the theatre where Tasha Mayo’s play was showing, Frank One walked into Soho, and ten minutes later, entered a comic-book shop.
As everyone she could see through the windows was male, Robin decided she’d made herself conspicuous by following him, so she retreated a few yards and took out her phone to call the number Strike had sent her.
An out-of-breath voice, slightly cracked, either from age, smoking, or both, answered.
‘Hello?’
‘Hello, is that Mrs Kennett?’ said Robin.
‘Yes. Who’s this?’
‘My name’s Robin Ellacott. I’m a private detective.’
‘You’re a what?’ said the elderly woman.
‘A private detective,’ said Robin.
Understandably, there was a short pause.
‘What d’you want?’ said the voice on the end of the line suspiciously.
‘I’ve been hired by somebody who’s very concerned about a relative of theirs, who’s a member of the Universal Humanitarian Church. I was hoping you might talk to me about the UHC. Just for background. You used to live at Chapman Farm, didn’t you?’
‘How d’you know that?’ said Sheila Kennett sharply; she certainly seemed to have all her faculties.
‘Just from records,’ said Robin, deliberately vague: she didn’t want to bandy about the fact that Strike had obtained census reports.
‘That was a long time ago,’ said Sheila Kennett.
‘We’re really just after background,’ said Robin. ‘I think you were there at the same time as the Pirbright family?’
‘I was, yeah,’ said Sheila, still sounding suspicious.
‘Well, we’re looking into some claims Kevin Pirbright made about the church, so we wondered whether—’
‘He’s dead, isn’t he?’
‘I – yes, he is,’ said Robin.
‘Yeah, I saw it in the paper. Wondered if it was our Kevin,’ said Sheila. ‘Have they got who did it yet?’
‘Not as far as I know,’ said Robin.
There was another short pause.
‘All right,’ said Sheila. ‘I don’t mind talking. I’ve got nothing to lose, not any more.’
‘That’s wonderful,’ said Robin, then thought how insensitive that had sounded and added, ‘I mean, thank you. You’re up in Coventry, aren’t you?’
‘Yeah.’
‘How would next Thursday suit you? A week tomorrow?’
‘Yeah, all right,’ said Sheila. ‘Robin, did you say your name was?’
‘That’s right. Robin Ellacott.’
‘Man’s name,’ said Sheila. ‘Why did your parents give you a man’s name?’
‘I’ve never asked,’ said Robin, with a laugh.
‘Hm. All right then. What time?’
‘Would midday be all right?’ asked Robin, rapidly calculating the distance to Coventry.
‘Yeah. All right. I’ll have the kettle on.’
‘Thank you so much. I’ll see you then!’ said Robin.
Robin texted Strike to tell him she’d arranged the interview with Sheila Kennett, then crossed the road, the better to watch the comic-book storefront.
The day was cool and cloudy, and Robin was glad of her beanie hat. She’d only just registered how close she was to the Rupert Court Temple when she spotted four young people with collecting tins, heading into Berwick Street.
Robin recognised Will Edensor at once. He looked ill and defeated, not to mention very thin. The shadows under his eyes, which Robin could see even from the other side of the street, gave him an unpleasant likeness to the image of the Stolen Prophet she’d seen on the temple ceiling. Like his companions, he was wearing an orange tabard printed with the church’s logo, which was repeated on their collecting tins.
The other man in the group seemed to be giving instructions. Unlike the other three, he was overweight, and wore his hair in a straggly bob. He pointed along the street, and the two girls headed off obediently in the direction indicated, whereas Will remained where he was. His demeanour made Robin think of a donkey, used to abuse, and no longer capable of protest.
The second man turned back to Will and delivered what looked like a lecture, through which Will nodded mechanically without making eye contact. Robin yearned to get close enough to hear what was going on, but dared not make herself recognisable to either of them. Before the lecture had finished, Frank One emerged from the comic-book shop, and Robin had no choice but to follow.
