The Running Grave
47
Nine at the beginning means:
When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Strike waited to read Robin’s most recent dispatch from Chapman Farm before finishing an interim report for Sir Colin Edensor. The question that was vexing him most was whether or not to reveal the possibility that Will had fathered a child with an underage girl at Chapman Farm. The overheard conversation Robin had mentioned didn’t, in Strike’s view, rise to the standard of proof, and he was wary of increasing Sir Colin’s anxiety without being certain of his facts. He therefore omitted mention of Will’s alleged paternity, and concluded:
Proposed Next Steps
We now have RE’s eyewitness account of physical coercion and injuries, plus her first-hand experience of underfeeding, enforced lack of sleep and a ‘therapeutic’ technique I think legitimate psychologists would agree is abusive. RE believes she may yet uncover evidence of more serious/criminal activity at Chapman Farm. Given that none of the church members RE and I have interviewed so far are willing to testify against the church, or likely to be credible witnesses given the length of time they’ve been out, I recommend RE staying undercover for the present.
I’ll be interviewing another ex-member of the UHC on the twenty-eighth of May and am actively searching for more. Identifying the subjects of the photographs RE found is a priority, as they suggest sexual abuse has been used as a form of discipline.
If you have any questions, please get in touch.
Having emailed the password-protected report to Sir Colin, Strike drank the last of his mug of tea, then sat for a few moments staring out of the window of his attic kitchen, contemplating several of his current dilemmas.
As he’d foreseen, the Private Eye article had led to phone calls from three different journalists, all of whose publications had tangled with Andrew Honbold QC in court and were consequently eager to wring as much newsprint as possible out of his extra-marital affair. On Strike’s instructions, Pat had responded with a one-line statement denying any involvement with Honbold or anyone associated with him. Honbold himself had issued a statement vehemently denying the Eye story and threatening legal action. Bijou’s name hadn’t appeared in the press, but Strike had a nasty feeling that there might yet be further repercussions from his ill-advised dalliance, and was keeping a weather-eye out for any opportunistic journalist who might be watching the office.
Meanwhile he still hadn’t managed to track down any of the former church members he was most eager to talk to, remained saddled with Littlejohn and was plagued by worries about his Uncle Ted, whom he’d called the previous evening and who appeared to have forgotten that he’d seen his nephew recently.
Strike turned his attention back to the laptop lying open on his kitchen table. More in hope than in expectation, he navigated to Torment Town’s Pinterest page, but there were no additional pictures, nor was there any response to his enquiry as to whether the artist drew from imagination.
He’d just got to his feet to wash up his mug when his mobile rang with a call transferred from the office. He picked up and had barely got his name out when a furious, high-pitched voice said,
‘I’ve had a fucking live snake posted through my front door!’
‘What?’ said Strike, completely nonplussed.
‘A fucking SNAKE! One of those total fuckers has put a fucking snake through my letter box!’
In rapid succession Strike realised that he was talking to the actress the Franks were stalking, that he’d momentarily forgotten her name, and that his team must have fucked up very badly indeed.
‘Did this happen this morning?’ he said, dropping back into his kitchen chair and opening the rota on his laptop to see who was on the Franks.
‘I don’t know, I’ve only just fucking found it in my sitting room, it could’ve been here for days!’
‘Have you called the police?’
‘What’s the point in calling the police? This is what I’m paying you to stop!’
‘I appreciate that,’ said Strike, ‘but the immediate problem is the snake.’
‘Oh, that’s all right,’ she said, thankfully no longer shouting. ‘I’ve put it in the bath. It’s only a corn snake. I used to have one, I’m not scared of them. Well,’ she added heatedly, ‘I’m not scared of them until I see them slithering out from beneath the sofa when I didn’t know they were there.’
‘Don’t blame you,’ said Strike, who’d just found out that Barclay and Midge were currently on the Franks. ‘It’d be good to get an approximate idea of when you think it might have arrived, because we’re keeping the brothers under constant surveillance and they haven’t been anywhere near your front door since the older one dropped your birthday card in. I’ve seen the video and there definitely wasn’t a snake in his hand.’
‘So you’re telling me I’ve got a third nutter after me?’
‘Not necessarily. Were you in last night?’
‘Yes, but—’
She broke off.
‘Oh. Actually, I do remember hearing the letter flap last night.’
‘What time?’
‘Must’ve been around ten. I was having a bath.’
‘Did you check to see whether anything had been put through the door?’
‘No. I kind of registered there was nothing there when I went downstairs to get a drink. I thought I must have mistaken a noise outside for the letter box.’
‘D’you need help getting rid of the snake?’ asked Strike, who felt this was the least he could do.
‘No,’ she sighed, ‘I’ll call the RSPCA or something.’
‘All right, I’ll contact the people I’ve got tailing the brothers, find out where they were last night at ten and get back to you. Glad to hear you’re not too shaken up, Tasha,’ he added, her name having just come back to him.
‘Thank you,’ she said, mollified. ‘OK, I’ll wait to hear back.’
When she’d hung up, Strike called Barclay.
‘You were on Frank One overnight, right?’
‘Yeah,’ said Barclay.
‘Where was he around ten?’
‘At home.’
‘You sure?’
‘Aye, and so was his brother. Frank Two hasn’t been oot at all these last few days. Mebbe he’s ill.’
‘Neither of them been near what’s-her-name’s house lately?’
‘Frank One took a stroll round there on Monday. Midge was on him.’
‘Right, I’ll call her. Thanks.’
Strike rang off and phoned Midge.
‘He definitely didn’t post anything through the front door,’ said Midge, when Strike explained why he was calling. ‘Just lurked on the opposite pavement, watching her windows. He’s been at home the last few days and so’s his brother.’
‘So Barclay said.’
‘She can’t have another stalker, can she?’
‘That’s exactly what she just asked me,’ said Strike. ‘Could be some deluded fan’s idea of a surprise gift, I s’pose. Apparently she used to own a corn snake.’
‘I don’t care how many snakes you’ve owned, you don’t want one posted through your bloody door at night,’ said Midge.
‘I agree. Have you seen any coppers visiting the Franks yet?’
‘Nope,’ said Midge.
‘OK, I’ll get back to the client. This might mean keeping someone on her house for a bit, as well as the Franks.’
‘Bloody hell. Who’d have thought this pair of freaks would turn out to be so labour intensive?’
‘Not me,’ admitted Strike.
After he’d hung up the phone he reached for his vape pen, frowning slightly as he inhaled nicotine, lost in thought for a minute. He then turned his attention back to the weekly rota.
Littlejohn and Shah had both had the previous evening off. Bigfoot’s extramarital activities were confined to daylight hours and he went home nightly to his suspicious, irritable wife. Strike was still asking himself whether the idea he’d just had was ludicrous, when his mobile rang again, forwarded from the office as before. Expecting his actress client, he realised too late that he was talking to Charlotte Campbell.
‘It’s me. Don’t hang up,’ she said quickly. ‘It’s in your best interests to hear what I’ve got to say.’
‘Say it, then,’ said Strike irritably.
‘A journalist from the Mail called me. They’re trying to run some sleazy profile of you, saying you sleep with female clients. Like father, like son, that kind of thing.’
Strike could feel the tension gripping every part of his body.
‘I told her I didn’t believe you’d ever sleep with a client, that you’re very honourable and that you’ve got strict ethics about that kind of thing. And I said you’re nothing like your father.’
Strike couldn’t have said what he was feeling, except a dim surprise mixed with some ghostly vestige of what he’d once felt for her, resurrected by the sorrowful voice he’d sometimes heard at the end of their worst fights, when even Charlotte’s ineradicable love of conflict left her spent and atypically honest.
‘I know they’ve been to a few of your exes as well,’ said Charlotte.
‘Who?’ said Strike.
‘Madeline, Ciara and Elin,’ said Charlotte. ‘Madeline and Elin have both said they’ve never hired a private detective and refused to give any other comment. Ciara says she just laughed when the Mail called her, then hung up.’
‘How the hell did they know I was with Elin?’ said Strike, more to himself than Charlotte. That affair, which had ended acrimoniously, had been conducted with what he’d thought was complete discretion on both their parts.
‘Darling, people talk,’ sighed Charlotte. ‘You should know that, seeing as it’s your job to make them. But I just wanted you to know, nobody’s cooperating and I’ve done what I could. You and I were together longest, so – so that should count for something.’
Strike tried to find something to say and finally mustered a ‘Well – thanks.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Charlotte. ‘I know you think I want to ruin your life, but I don’t. I don’t.’
‘I never thought you wanted to ruin my life,’ said Strike, now rubbing his face with his hand. ‘I just thought you didn’t mind messing with it a bit.’
‘What d’you—?’
‘Shit-stirring,’ said Strike. ‘With Madeline.’
‘Oh,’ said Charlotte. ‘Yeah… I did do that, a bit.’
The answer forced a reluctant laugh out of Strike.
‘How are you?’ he said. ‘How’s your health?’
‘I’m fine.’
‘Really?’
‘Yes. I mean, they’ve caught it early.’
‘OK, well, thanks for doing what you could with the Mail. I’ll just have to hope they haven’t got enough to run with.’
‘Bluey,’ she said urgently, and his heart sank.
‘What?’
‘Could we have a drink? Just a drink. To talk.’
‘No,’ he said wearily.
‘Why not?’
‘Because,’ he said, ‘it’s over. I’ve told you this, repeatedly. We’re through.’
‘And we can’t even stay friends?’
‘Jesus Christ, Charlotte, we were never friends. That was the whole trouble. We were never fucking friends.’
‘How can you say—?’
‘Because it’s true,’ he said forcefully. ‘Friends don’t do to each other what we did. Friends have each other’s backs. They want each other to be OK. They don’t rip each other apart every time there’s a problem.’
Her breathing was ragged in his ear.
‘You’re with Robin, aren’t you?’
‘My love life’s none of your business any more,’ said Strike. ‘I said it in the pub the other week, I wish you well, but I don’t—’
Charlotte hung up.
Strike replaced the mobile on his kitchen table and reached for his vape again. Several minutes passed before he was able to subdue his disordered thoughts. Finally, he returned his attention to the rota on the screen in front of him, his eyes fixed on the name Littlejohn, and after some further rumination, picked up his mobile again, and once again called Shanker.
