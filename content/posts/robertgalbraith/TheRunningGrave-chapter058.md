The Running Grave
58
Two daughters live together, but their minds are not directed to common concerns.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Robin knew Colin Edensor’s one thousand pounds must have reached the UHC’s bank account because a few days after she’d given Mazu her letter ordering the bank transfer she was reunited with her original group of high-level recruits. Nobody mentioned her Revelation session, nor did anyone welcome her back; all behaved as though she’d never been away.
This mutually agreed silence extended to Kyle’s unexplained absence from the group. Robin knew better than to ask how he’d transgressed, but she was certain he’d done something wrong because she soon spotted him doing the kind of hard manual work she’d just been allowed to give up. Robin also noticed that Vivienne now averted her eyes whenever her group and Kyle’s passed each other.
Robin found out what Kyle’s crime had been when she sat down opposite Shawna at dinner that night.
Following Shawna’s ill-advised recruitment of Robin to help with the children’s lessons, her head had been shaved. While she’d seemed cowed when she first appeared in her newly bald state, her fundamentally garrulous and indiscreet nature had now reasserted itself, and her first proud words to Robin were,
‘Oi’m increasing again.’
She patted her lower belly.
‘Oh,’ said Robin. ‘Congratulations.’
‘Yew don’t say that,’ scoffed Shawna. ‘Oi’m not doing it for me. Yew should be congratulating the church.’
‘Right,’ said Robin wearily. She’d deliberately sat with Shawna in the hopes of hearing more news about Jacob, because she had a hunch it was his fate she’d overheard Harmon, Zhou and Becca discussing in Mazu’s office, but she’d forgotten how exasperating the girl could be.
‘Did yew hear about him?’ Shawna asked Robin in a gleeful whisper, as Kyle passed the end of the table.
‘No,’ said Robin.
‘Hahaha,’ said Shawna.
The people beside them were locked in their own intense conversation. Shawna glanced sideways to make sure she wouldn’t be overheard before leaning in and whispering to Robin,
‘He says he carn’t spirit bond with, you know… women. Said it right to Mazu’s face.’
‘Well,’ said Robin cautiously, also whispering, ‘I mean… he’s gay, isn’t he? So—’
‘Thass materialism,’ said Shawna, louder than she’d intended, and one of the young men beside them glanced around and Shawna, greatly against Robin’s wishes, said loudly to them,
‘She thinks there’s such a thing as “gay”.’
Clearly deciding no good would come of responding to Shawna, the young man turned back to his conversation.
‘Bodies don’t matter,’ Shawna told Robin firmly. ‘On’y spirit matters.’
She leaned in again, once more talking in a conspiratorial whisper.
‘Vivienne wanted to spirit bond with ’im and I ’eard ’e ran out there, loike, crying, hahaha. Thass proper egomotability, thinking people aren’ good enough to sleep with.’
Robin nodded silently, which appeared to satisfy Shawna. As they ate, Robin tried to lead Shawna onto the subject of Jacob, but other than Shawna’s confident assertion that he was bound to pass soon, because Papa J had decreed it, found out no more information.
Robin’s next letter to Strike was devoid of useful information. However, two days after placing it in the plastic rock, she and the rest of the high-level recruits, minus Kyle, were led to another crafting session by Becca Pirbright.
It was a hot, cloudless June day, and Becca was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the church’s logo instead of a sweatshirt, although the ordinary members continued to wear their heavy tracksuits. Field poppies and daisies had bloomed along the path to the Portakabins, and Robin might have felt uplifted but for the fact that fine weather at Chapman Farm turned her thoughts to all the places she’d rather have been. Even central London, never the most comfortable place in a heatwave, had a halcyon quality to her these days. She could have put on a summer dress instead of this thick tracksuit, bought herself a bottle of water at will, walked anywhere, freely…
A startled mutter issued from the group as they approached the Portakabin where they usually made corn dollies. The tables had been moved outside, so that they wouldn’t have to endure the stuffiness of the crafting room, but their surprise had nothing to do with the relocated tables.
Several church members were constructing a twelve-foot-high man of straw beside the Portakabin. It appeared to have a strong wire frame, and Robin now realised that the large straw sculpture she’d previously seen Wan working on had been the head.
‘We make one of these every year, in celebration of the Manifestation of the Stolen Prophet,’ the smiling Becca told the group, who were all contemplating the large straw man as they sat down at the crafting tables. ‘The prophet was a gifted craftsman himself, so—’
Becca’s voice faltered. Emily had just emerged from behind the straw sculpture, hands full of twine. Emily’s head was freshly shaven; like Louise, she clearly hadn’t been given permission to let her hair regrow yet. Emily threw Becca a cold, challenging look before returning to her work.
‘—so we celebrate him by the means he chose to express himself,’ Becca finished.
As the group reached automatically for their piles of hollow straws, Robin saw that her companions had now graduated to making Norfolk lanterns, which were more complex than those she’d previously made. As nobody seemed inclined to help her, she reached for the laminated instructions on the table to see what she had to do, the sun beating down upon her back.
Becca disappeared into the crafting room and returned with the leatherbound copy of The Answer from which Mazu had previously read while they worked. Removing a silk bookmark indicating where they’d last got to, Becca cleared her throat and began to read.
‘“I come now to a part of my personal faith story that’s as dreadful as it’s miraculous, as heartrending as it’s joyful.
‘“Let me first state that to those who live in the bubble world, what I’m about to relate – or at least, my reaction to it, and my understanding of it – is likely to be baffling, even shocking. How, they’ll ask, can the death of a child ever be miraculous or joyful?
‘“I must begin by describing Daiyu. Materialists would call her my daughter, although I’d have loved her just the same had there been no fleshly bond.
‘“From her earliest childhood, it was evident that Daiyu would never need awakening. She’d been born awake, and her metaphysical abilities were extraordinary. She could tame wild livestock with a glance and locate lost objects unerringly, no matter how far away they were. She showed no interest in childish games or toys, but turned instinctively towards scripture, able to read before being taught, and to speak truths it takes many people a lifetime to understand.”’
‘And she could turn herself invisible,’ said a cool voice from over beside the towering straw man.
Several of the group glanced at Emily, but Becca ignored the interruption.
‘“As she grew, her powers became only more exceptional. The idea of a four- or five-year-old having her degree of spiritual calling would have seemed nonsensical to me had I not witnessed it. Every day she grew in wisdom and gave further proofs of her pure communication with the Blessed Divinity. Even as a child, she far surpassed me in understanding. I’d spent years struggling to understand and harness my own spiritual gifts. Daiyu simply accepted her abilities as natural, without inner conflict, without confusion.
‘“I look back now and wonder how I didn’t understand what her destiny was, although she spoke to me of it, a few short days before her earthly end.
‘“‘Papa, I must visit the Blessed Divinity soon, but don’t worry, I’ll come back.’
‘“I imagined she was speaking of the state pure spirits attain when they see the face of the Divinity clearly, and which I have achieved myself, through chanting, fasting and meditation. I knew that Daiyu, like me, had already seen and spoken to the Divinity. The word ‘visit’ should have warned me, but I was blind where she saw plainly.
‘“The Divinity’s chosen instrument was a young woman who took Daiyu to the dark sea while I slept. Daiyu walked joyfully towards the horizon before the sun had risen and disappeared from the material world, her fleshly body dissolving into the ocean. She was what the world calls dead.
‘“My despair was unconfined. It was weeks before I understood that this is why she was sent to us. Hadn’t she said to me, many times, ‘Papa, I exist beyond mere matter’? She’d been sent to teach us all, but to teach me particularly, that the only truth, the only reality, is spirit. And when I fully understood as much, and after I’d humbly told the Blessed Divinity so, Daiyu returned.
‘“‘Yes, she came back to me, I saw her as plainly—’”
Emily laughed scornfully. Becca slammed the book shut and got to her feet while the apprehensive corn dolly-makers pretended not to be watching.
‘Come in here for a moment, Emily, please,’ Becca told her sister.
Her expression defiant, Emily set down the straw she’d been binding to the torso of the gigantic statue and followed Becca into the cabin. Determined to know what was going on, Robin, who knew there was a small portable toilet to the rear of the crafting rooms, muttered, ‘Loo,’ and left the group.
All the windows of the Portakabin were open, doubtless in an effort to make it cool enough to work in. Robin moved round the building until she was out of sight of the other workers, then crept to stand beneath a window at the back, through which Becca and Emily’s voices, though low, were just audible.
‘… don’t understand what the problem is, I was agreeing with you.’
‘Why did you laugh?’
‘Why d’you think? Don’t you remember, when we recognised Lin—’
‘Shut up. Shut up now.’
‘Fine, I’ll—’
‘Come back. Come back here. Why did you say that, about invisibility?’
‘Oh, I’m allowed to speak now, am I? Well, that’s what you said happened. You were the one who told me what to say.’
‘That’s a lie. If you want to tell a different story now, go ahead, nobody’s stopping you!’
Emily let out something between a gasp and a laugh.
‘You filthy hypocrite.’
‘Says the person who’s back here because her EM’s out of control!’
‘My EM? Look at you!’ said Emily, with contempt. ‘There’s more EM in this place than in any of the other centres.’
‘Well, you’d know, you’ve been kicked out of enough of them. I’d have thought you’d realise you’re hanging by a thread, Emily.’
‘Says who?’
‘Says Mazu. You’re lucky you’re not Mark Three, after Birmingham, but it could still happen.’
Robin heard footsteps and guessed Becca had chosen to leave on her threatening line, but Emily spoke again, now sounding desperate.
‘You’d rather I went the same way as Kevin, wouldn’t you? Just kill myself.’
‘You dare talk about Kevin, to me?’
‘Why shouldn’t I talk about him?’
‘I know what you did, Emily.’
‘What did I do?’
‘You spoke to Kevin, for his book.’
‘What?’ said Emily, now sounding blank. ‘How?’
‘The disgusting room where he shot himself was covered with writing, and he’d written my name on the wall, and something about a plot.’
‘You think Kevin would have wanted contact with me, after we—?’
‘Shut up, for God’s sake, shut up! You don’t care about anyone except yourself, do you? Not about Papa J or the mission—’
‘If Kevin knew something about you and a plot, I didn’t tell him. But he always agreed with me that you’re full of shit.’
Robin didn’t know what Becca did next, but Emily let out a gasp of what sounded like pain.
‘You need to eat your vegetables,’ said Becca, her menacing voice unrecognisable, compared to the bright tone in which she generally spoke. ‘You hear me? And you’ll work on the vegetable patch and you’ll like it, or I’ll tell the Council I know you cooperated with Kevin.’
‘You won’t,’ said Emily, now sobbing, ‘you won’t, you bloody coward, because you know what I could tell them if I wanted!’
‘If you’re talking about Daiyu, go right ahead. I’ll be informing Papa J and Mazu of this conversation, so—’
‘No – no, Becca, don’t—’
‘It’s my duty,’ said Becca. ‘You can tell them what you think you saw.’
‘No, Becca, please don’t tell them—’
‘Could Daiyu become invisible, Emily?’
There was a short silence.
‘Yes,’ said Emily, her voice quaking, ‘but—’
‘Either she could or she couldn’t. Which is it?’
‘She… could.’
‘Correct. So don’t let me hear you saying anything different, ever again, you filthy little pig.’
Robin heard footsteps, and the door of the cabin slammed.
