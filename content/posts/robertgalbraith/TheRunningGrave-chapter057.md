The Running Grave
57
Nine at the beginning…
When you see evil people,
Guard yourself against mistakes.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
To Robin’s relief, Strike’s next letter offered a solution to the problem of giving money to the UHC.
I’ve spoken to Colin Edensor and he’s prepared to make £1000 available for a donation. If you get their account details, we’ll set up a bank transfer.
In consequence, Robin asked permission to visit Mazu in the farmhouse the following morning.
‘I want to make a donation to the church,’ she explained to the hard-faced woman who’d been supervising her stint in the kitchens.
‘All right. Go now, before lunch,’ said the woman, with the first smile Robin had received from her. Glad to escape the fug of boiling noodles and turmeric, Robin pulled off her apron and left.
The June day was overcast, but as Robin crossed the deserted courtyard the sun slid out from behind a cloud and turned Daiyu’s fountain-dappled pool into a basin of diamonds. Thankfully, Emily was no longer standing on her crate. She’d remained there for a full forty-eight hours, ignored and unmentioned by all who passed, as though she’d always stood there and always would. Robin had pitied Emily doubly by the time urine stains had appeared on the inside of her tracksuit bottoms and track marks of tears had striped her muddy face, but she’d imitated all other church members and acted as though the woman was invisible.
The other absence currently improving life at Chapman Farm was that of Taio Wace, who was visiting the Glasgow centre. The removal of the ever-present fear that he’d try and take her into a Retreat Room again was such a relief that Robin even felt less tired than usual, although her regime of manual labour continued.
She knelt at Daiyu’s pool, made the usual tribute, then approached the carved double doors of the farmhouse. As she reached them, Sita, a brown-skinned, elderly woman with a long rope of steel-grey hair opened it from the inside, carrying a bulging plastic sack. As they passed each other, Robin smelled a foul odour of faeces.
‘Could you tell me where Mazu’s office is?’ she asked Sita.
‘Straight through the house, at the back.’
So Robin walked past the staircase, along the red-carpeted corridor lined with Chinese masks and painted panels, right into the heart of the farmhouse. Walking past what she assumed to be the kitchen she smelled roasting lamb, which was in stark contrast to the depressing miasma of boiling tinned vegetables she’d just left.
At the very end of the corridor, facing her, was a closed black lacquer door. As she approached, she heard voices inside.
‘… ethical question, surely?’ said a man she was almost certain was Giles Harmon. Though he’d said he was staying only a few days, he’d now been at the farm a week, and Robin had spotted him leading other teenaged girls towards the Retreat Rooms. Harmon, who never wore the scarlet tracksuit of ordinary members, was usually attired in jeans and what looked like expensive shirts. His bedroom in the farmhouse overlooked the yard and he was often to be seen typing at the desk in front of the window.
Harmon’s voice wasn’t as carefully modulated as usual. In fact, Robin thought she heard a trace of panic.
‘Everything we do here is ethical,’ said a second male voice, which she recognised at once as that of Andy Zhou. ‘This is the ethical course. Remember, he doesn’t feel as we do. There is no soul there.’
‘You approve?’ Harmon asked someone.
‘Absolutely,’ said a voice Robin had no trouble identifying as Becca Pirbright’s.
‘Well, if you think so. After all, he’s your—’
‘There’s no connection, Giles,’ said Becca, almost angrily. ‘No connection at all. I’m surprised you—’
‘Sorry, sorry,’ said Harmon placatingly. ‘Materialist values – I’ll meditate now. I’m sure whatever you all think is best. You’ve been dealing with the situation far longer than I have, of course.’
Robin thought he said it as though rehearsing a defence. She heard footsteps, and had seconds to dash back along the hall, making as little noise as possible on her trainered feet, so that when Harmon opened the office door, she appeared to be walking towards it from ten yards away.
‘Is Mazu free?’ Robin asked. ‘I’ve been given permission to see her.’
‘She will be, in a few minutes,’ said Harmon. ‘You should probably wait here.’
He passed her and headed upstairs. Seconds later, the study door opened for a second time and Dr Zhou and Becca emerged.
‘What are you doing here, Rowena?’ said Becca, and Robin thought her bright smile was a little more forced than usual.
‘I want to make a donation to the church,’ said Robin. ‘I was told I should see Mazu about it.’
‘Oh, I see. Yes, carry on, she’s in there,’ said Becca, pointing towards the office. She and Zhou walked away, their voices too low for Robin to catch what they were saying.
Bracing herself slightly, Robin approached the office door and knocked.
‘Come,’ said Mazu, and Robin entered.
The office, which had been added to the rear of the building, was so cluttered and colourful, and smelled so strongly of incense, that Robin felt as though she’d stepped through a portal into a bazaar. A profusion of statuettes, deities and idols were crammed onto the shelves.
Daiyu’s enlarged photograph sat in a golden frame on top of a Chinese cabinet, where joss paper was burning in a dish. Flowers and small offerings of food had been laid out in front of her. For a split second Robin felt a wholly unexpected spasm of compassion for Mazu, who sat facing her at an ebony desk that resembled Zhou’s, wearing her long blood-red dress, her black waist-length hair falling either side of her white face, her mother-of-pearl fish pendant glimmering on her chest.
‘Rowena,’ she said, unsmiling, and Robin’s moment of kindness vanished as though it had never been, as she seemed again to smell Mazu’s dirty foot, revealed for her to kiss.
‘Um – I’d like to make a donation to the church.’
Mazu surveyed her unsmilingly for a moment, then said,
‘Sit down.’
Robin did as she was told. As she did so, she noticed an incongruous object on a shelf behind Mazu’s head: a small, white plastic air freshener, which seemed entirely pointless in this room full of incense.
‘So you’ve decided you want to give us money, have you?’ said Mazu, scrutinising Robin with those dark, crooked eyes.
‘Yes. Taio talked to me,’ Robin said, certain that Mazu would know this, ‘and I’ve been doing some hard thinking, and, well, I see he was right, I am still struggling with materialism, and it’s time to put my money where my mouth is.’
A small smile appeared on the long, pale face.
‘Yet you refused spirit bonding.’
‘I felt so awful after Revelation, I didn’t think I was worthy,’ said Robin. ‘But I want to eradicate the false self, I really do. I know I’ve got a lot of work to do.’
‘How are you intending to donate? You didn’t bring any credit cards with you.’
Robin registered this admission that her locker had been opened and searched.
‘Theresa told me not to. Theresa’s my sister, she – she didn’t want me to come here at all. She said the UHC’s a cult,’ said Robin apologetically.
‘And you listened to your sister.’
‘No, but I really came here just to explore things. I didn’t know I’d stay. If I’d known how I’d feel once I’d had my Week of Service I’d have brought my bank cards – but if you let me write to Theresa, I’ll be able to arrange a bank transfer to the church’s account. I’d like to donate a thousand pounds.’
She saw, by the slight widening of Mazu’s eyes, that she hadn’t expected so large a donation.
‘Very well,’ she said, opening a drawer in her desk and withdrawing a pen, writing paper and a blank envelope. She also pushed a template letter to copy and a card printed with the UHC’s bank account details across the desk. ‘You can do that now. Luckily,’ said Mazu, taking a ring of keys from another drawer, ‘your sister wrote to you just this morning. I was going to ask somebody to give you her letter at lunch.’
Mazu now headed towards the cabinet on which Daiyu’s portrait stood and unlocked it. Robin caught a glimpse of piles of envelopes held together with elastic bands. Mazu extracted one of these, relocked the cabinet and said, still holding the letter,
‘I’ll be back in a moment.’
When the door had closed behind Mazu, Robin took a quick look around the office, her eye falling on a plug socket in the skirting board, into which nothing was plugged. With the camera she believed was hidden in the air freshener recording her every move she didn’t dare examine it, but she suspected, having used such devices herself, that this innocent socket was also a covert recording device. Possibly Mazu had left the room to see what she’d do if left alone, so Robin didn’t move from her chair, but set to work copying out the template letter.
Mazu returned a few minutes later.
‘Here,’ she said, holding out the letter addressed to Robin.
‘Thank you,’ said Robin, opening it. She was certain it had already been opened and read, judging by the suspiciously strong glue used to reseal it. ‘Oh good,’ said Robin, scanning the letter in Midge’s handwriting, ‘she’s given me her new address, I didn’t have it.’
She finished copying out the template letter, addressed the envelope and sealed it.
‘I can get that posted for you,’ said Mazu, holding out a hand.
‘Thank you,’ said Robin, getting to her feet. ‘I feel much better for doing this.’
‘You shouldn’t be giving money to “feel better”,’ said Mazu.
They were the same height, but somehow, Robin still felt as though Mazu was the taller.
‘Your personal bar to pure spirit is egomotivity, Rowena,’ said Mazu. ‘You continue to put the materialist self ahead of the collective.’
‘Yes,’ said Robin. ‘I – I am trying.’
‘Well, we’ll see,’ said Mazu, with a little waggle of the letter Robin had just handed her, and the latter surmised that not until the funds were safely in the UHC’s bank account would she be deemed to have made spiritual progress.
Robin left the farmhouse holding her letter. Though it was lunchtime, and she was very hungry, she made a detour to the women’s bathroom to examine the page in her hand more closely.
Robin noticed, tilting the paper beneath the overhead light in the toilet cubicle, there was an almost imperceptible line of strip Tippex: somebody had obliterated the date on which it had been sent. Flipping the envelope over she saw that the time and date of the postmark had also been blurred. So exhausted she could no longer estimate lengths of time with much accuracy, and having no recourse to any calendar, Robin couldn’t remember exactly when she’d requested the fake letter from Theresa, but she doubted she’d ever have known it existed had Mazu not wanted her to have Theresa’s address.
For the first time, it occurred to Robin that one reason for Will Edensor’s lack of response to the letters informing him that his mother was dying might be that he’d never received them. Will was in possession of a large trust fund, and it was surely in the church’s interests that he remain at the farm, meekly handing over money, rather than discover, on learning of his mother’s death, that he couldn’t see her as a flesh object, or treat her love as materialist possession.
