The Running Grave
38
Six at the top…
Not light but darkness.
First he climbed up to heaven,
Then he plunged into the depths of the earth.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
The drive was bordered with high hedges, so Strike saw little of the surrounding gardens until he reached the gravel forecourt in front of the hall, which was an irregular but impressive building of grey-blue stone, with Gothic windows and a front door of solid oak reached by a flight of stone steps. He paused for a few seconds after leaving the car to take in the immaculate green lawns, the topiary lions and the water garden glimmering in the distance. Then a door creaked and a croaky but powerful male voice said,
‘Hello thah!’
An elderly man had come out of the house and now stood leaning on a mahogany stick at the top of the stone steps to the front door. He was wearing a shirt under his tweed blazer, and the blue and maroon regimental tie of the Grenadier Guards. Beside him stood an immensely fat yellow Labrador, wagging its tail but evidently deciding to wait for the newcomer to climb the steps rather than descend to greet him.
‘Can’t get down the damn steps any more without help, sorry!’
‘No problem,’ Strike said, the gravel crunching beneath his feet as he approached the front door. ‘Colonel Graves, I presume?’
‘How d’yeh do?’ said Graves, shaking hands. He had a thick white moustache and a slight overbite, faintly reminiscent of a rabbit or, if you were being unkind, of the standard impersonation of an upper-class twit. The eyes blinking behind the lenses of his steel-rimmed glasses were milky with cataracts, and a large, flesh-coloured hearing aid protruded from one ear.
‘Come in, come in – here, Gunga Din,’ he added. Strike took the last exhortation to be an invitation to the fat Labrador now sniffing at the hems of his trousers, rather than himself.
Colonel Graves shuffled along ahead of Strike into a large hall, cane thudding loudly on the dark polished floorboards, the panting Labrador bringing up the rear. Victorian oil portraits of what Strike didn’t doubt were ancestors looked down upon the two men and the dog. The place had an aged, serene beauty enhanced by the light flooding through a large leaded window over the stairs.
‘Beautiful house,’ said Strike.
‘M’grandfather bought it. Beerocracy. Brewery’s long gone, though. Graves Stout, ever heard of it?’
‘Afraid not.’
‘Went out of business in 1953. Still got a couple of bottles in the cellar. Nasty stuff. M’father made us drink it. Foundation of the family’s fortune and what have yah. Hyar we are,’ said the colonel, by now panting as loudly as his dog as he pushed open a door.
They entered a large drawing room of homely upper-class comfort, with deep sofas and armchairs of faded chintz, more leaded windows looking out onto the splendid gardens and a dog’s bed made of tweed, into which the Labrador flopped with an air of having had more than his day’s worth of exercise.
Three people were sitting around a low table laden with tea things and what looked like a home-baked Victoria sponge. In an armchair sat an elderly woman with thin white hair, who was dressed in navy blue and pearls. Her hands were trembling so much that Strike wondered whether she had Parkinson’s disease. A couple in their late forties were sitting side by side on the sofa. The balding man’s heavy eyebrows and prominent Roman nose gave him the look of an eagle. His tie, unless he was pretending to be something he wasn’t, which Strike thought unlikely in this context, proclaimed that he’d once been a Royal Marine. His wife, who was plump and blonde, was wearing a pink cashmere sweater and a tweed skirt. Her bobbed hair was tied back in a velvet bow, a style Strike hadn’t seen since the eighties, while her ruddy, broken-veined cheeks suggested a life led largely out of doors.
‘M’wife, Barbara,’ said Colonel Graves, ‘our daughter, Phillipa, and her husband, Nicholas.’
‘Good morning,’ said Strike.
‘Hello,’ said Mrs Graves. Phillipa merely nodded at Strike, unsmiling. Nicholas made no sound or gesture of welcome.
‘Siddown,’ said the colonel, gesturing Strike to an armchair opposite the sofa. He himself lowered himself slowly into a high-backed chair with a grunt of relief.
‘How d’you take your tea?’ Mrs Graves asked.
‘Strong, please.’
‘Good man,’ barked the colonel. ‘Can’t stand weak tea.’
‘I’ll do it, Mummy,’ said Phillipa, and indeed, Mrs Graves’ hands were trembling so much, Strike thought it advisable she didn’t handle boiling water.
‘Cake?’ the unsmiling Phillipa asked him, once she’d passed his tea.
‘I’d love some,’ said Strike. Sod the diet.
Once everyone had been served, and Phillipa had sat down again, Strike said,
‘Well, I’m very grateful for this chance to talk to you. I understand this can’t be easy.’
‘We’ve been assured you’re not a sleaze hound,’ said Nicholas.
‘Good to know,’ said Strike drily.
‘No offence,’ said Nicholas, though his manner was that of a man who didn’t particularly mind being offensive and might even pride herself on it, ‘but we thought it important to check you out.’
‘Do we have your assurance we’re not going to be dragged into the tabloids?’ said Phillipa.
‘You do seem to make a habit of popping up there,’ said Nicholas.
Strike could have pointed out that he’d never given the press an interview, that most of the journalistic interest he’d aroused had been due to solving criminal cases, and that it was hardly within his control whether the press became interested in his investigation. Instead he said,
‘At the moment, the risk of press interest is slight to non-existent.’
‘But you think it might all be dragged up?’ Phillipa pressed him. ‘Because our children don’t know anything about all this. They think their uncle died of natural causes.’
‘It was so long ago now, Pips,’ said Mrs Graves. Strike thought she seemed a little nervous of her daughter and son-in-law. ‘It’s been twenty-three years. Allie would have been fifty-two now,’ she added quietly, to nobody.
‘If we can stop another family going through what we did,’ said Colonel Graves loudly, ‘we’ll be delighted. One has an obligation,’ he said, with a look at his son-in-law that, in spite of his cloudy eyes, was pointed. Turning stiffly in his chair to address Strike he said, ‘What d’yeh want to know?’
‘Well,’ said Strike, ‘I’d like to start with Alexander, if that’s all right.’
‘We always called him Allie, in the family,’ said the colonel.
‘How did he become interested in the church?’
‘Long story,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘He was ill, yeh see – but we didn’t realise f’ra long time. What did they call it?’ he asked his wife, but it was his daughter who answered.
‘Manic depression, but they’ve probably got another fancy word for it, these days.’
Phillipa’s tone suggested scepticism of the psychiatric profession and all its ways.
‘When he was younger,’ said Mrs Graves tremulously, ‘we just thought he was naughty.’
‘Problems all through school,’ said Colonel Graves, nodding ruminatively. ‘Expelled from Rugby, in the end.’
‘Why was that?’ asked Strike.
‘Drugs,’ said Colonel Graves gloomily. ‘I was stationed out in Germany at the time. We brought him out to join us. Put him into the international school to do his A-levels, but he didn’t like it. Huge rows. Missed his friends. “Why’s Pips allowed to stay in England?” I said, “Pips hasn’t been caught smoking marriage-huana in her dorm, that’s why.” I was hopin’,’ said the colonel, ‘bein’ around the military, y’know – might show him another way. I’d always hoped… but there y’are.’
‘His granny volunteered to have Allie stay with her, in Kent,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘She always loved Allie. He was to finish his A-levels at the local college, but next thing we heard, he’d taken orf. Granny was out of her mind with worry. I flew back to England to help look for him and found him staying with one of his old schoolfriends, in London.’
‘Tom Bantling,’ said Colonel Graves, nodding lugubriously. ‘Both of ’em holed up in a basement, doin’ drugs all day. Tom sorted himself out in the end, mind you,’ he added with a sigh. ‘OBE now… trouble was, y’see, by the time Baba found him, Allie had turned eighteen. One couldn’t make him come home, or do anything he didn’t want to.’
‘How was he supporting himself?’ asked Strike.
‘He had some money his other grandmother left him,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘She left some to you, too, didn’t she, darling?’ she added to Phillipa. ‘You used yours to buy Bugle Boy, didn’t you?’
Mrs Graves gestured towards a bow-fronted cabinet on which many silver-framed photographs stood. After a second’s confusion Strike realised his attention was being directed to one of the largest pictures, which featured a stout, beaming teenaged Phillipa in full hunting garb, sitting on top of a gigantic grey horse, presumably Bugle Boy, hounds milling behind them. Her hair, which was dark in the photograph, was tied back in what looked like the same velvet bow she was wearing today.
‘So Allie had enough money to live on without working?’ Strike said.
‘Yerse, until he burned through it all,’ said Colonel Graves, ‘which he did in about twelve months. Then he signed on for the whatchamacallit – dole. I decided to leave th’army. Didn’t want to leave Baba hyar on her own, tryin’ to sort him out. It was startin’ to be obvious there was something very wrong.’
‘He was showing definite signs of mental illness by then, was he?’
‘Yes,’ said Mrs Graves, ‘he was getting very paranoid and strange. Funny ideas about the government. But the awful thing is, one didn’t really think of it as mental illness at the time, because he’d always been a bit—’
‘Told us he was getting messages from God,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Thought it was the drugs. We thought, if only he’d just stop smoking that bloody marriage-huana… he fell out with Tom Bantling, and after that he stayed on other people’s sofas until they got annoyed and kicked him out. Tried to keep tabs on him, but sometimes we didn’t know where he was.’
‘Then he got himself into awful trouble, in a pub. Nick was with him, weren’t you?’ Mrs Graves said to her son-in-law. ‘They were at school together,’ she explained to Strike.
‘I was trying to talk sense into him,’ said Nicholas, ‘when some fella bumped inter him, an’ he lashed out with a beer glass. Cut the chap’s face. Stitches. He was charged.’
‘Quite right, too,’ barked the colonel. ‘Couldn’t argue with that. We got him a lawyer, personal friend of ours, and Danvers fixed up a psychiatrist.’
‘Allie only agreed because he was terrified of prison,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘That was a real fear of his, being locked up. I think that’s why he never liked boarding school.’
Phillipa gave the slightest of eye rolls, unnoticed by her parents, though not by Strike.
‘So the psychiatrist fella diagnosed this manic what-have-you,’ said Colonel Graves, ‘and put him on pills.’
‘And he said Allie mustn’t smoke pot any more,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘We got Allie cleaned up for court, got him a haircut and so on, and he looked marvellous in his suit. And the judge was really very nice and basically said he thought Allie would do best with community service. And at the time,’ sighed Mrs Graves, ‘we thought him getting arrested was a blessing in disguise, didn’t we, Archie? Not that we wanted some poor chap to be hurt, of course.’
‘And he came back here to live, did he?’ Strike asked.
‘’Sright,’ said Colonel Graves.
‘And his mental state improved?’
‘Yes, it was much better,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘And you loved having him home, didn’t you, Pips?’
‘Hm,’ said Phillipa.
‘It was like having him back to how he was when he was a little boy,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘He was really awfully sweet and funny…’
Tears swam in her eyes.
‘’Pologise,’ she whispered, fumbling in her sleeve for a handkerchief.
Colonel Graves assumed the stolid, wooden expression of the average upper-class Englishman when confronted with a show of open emotion. Nicholas took refuge in sweeping cake crumbs off his jeans. Phillipa merely stared stonily at the teapot.
‘What community service was Allie given?’ asked Strike.
‘Well, that’s where she got her claws into him, y’see,’ said Colonel Graves heavily. ‘Community project fifty minutes up the road, in Aylmerton. Cleanin’ up litter and so on. There were a couple of people there from Chapman Farm, and she was one of ’em. Mazu.’
The name changed the atmosphere in the room. Though the sunshine continued to flood in through the leaded windows, it seemed, somehow, to darken.
‘He didn’t tell us he’d met a gel at first,’ said the colonel.
‘But he was spending longer than he needed to in Aylmerton,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Coming home very late. We could smell alcohol on his breath again, and we knew he wasn’t supposed to be drinking on his medication.’
‘So there was another row,’ said Colonel Graves, ‘and he blurted out that he’d met someone, but he said he knew we wouldn’t like her, and that’s why he took her to the pub instead of comin’ hyar. And I said, “Watcha talkin’ about, we wouldn’t like her? How d’yeh know? Bring her over to meet us. Bring her for tea!” Tryin’ to make him happy, y’know. So he did. He brought her hyar…
‘He’d made it sound as though Mazu was a farmer’s daughter, before he brought her t’meet us. Nothin’ wrong with that. But I could tell she wasn’t a farmer’s daughter, moment I laid eyes on her.’
‘We’d never met any of his gelfriends before,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Bit of a shock.’
‘Why was that?’ asked Strike.
‘Well,’ said Mrs Graves, ‘she was very young and—’
‘Filthy,’ said Phillipa.
‘—bit grubby,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Long black hair. Skinny, with dirty jeans and a sort of smock.’
‘Didn’t talk,’ said Colonel Graves.
‘Not a word,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Just sat next to Allie, where Nick and Pips are sitting now, clinging to his arm. We tried to be nice, didn’t we?’ she said plaintively to her husband, ‘But she just stared at us through her hair. And Allie could tell we didn’t like her.’
‘Nobody could’ve bloody liked her,’ said Nicholas.
‘You met her too?’ asked Strike.
‘Met her later,’ said Nicholas. ‘Made my bloody flesh crawl.’
‘It wasn’t shyness,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘I could’ve understood shyness, but that’s not why she didn’t say anything. One had a sense, of real… badness. And Allie got defensive – didn’t he, Archie? – “You think I like her because I’m mental.” Well, of course we didn’t think that, but we could tell she was encouraging the – the unstable part of him.’
‘It was obvious she was the stronger personality,’ said Colonel Graves, nodding.
‘She can’t have been more than sixteen, and Allie was twenty-three when he met her,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘It’s very hard to explain. From the outside, it looked… I mean, we thought she was too young for him, but Allie was…’
Her voice trailed away.
‘Bloody hell, Gunga,’ said Nicholas angrily.
The stench of the old dog’s fart had just reached Strike’s nostrils.
‘The hell are you feeding him?’ Phillipa demanded of her parents.
‘He had some of our rabbit last night,’ said Mrs Graves apologetically.
‘You spoil him, Mummy,’ snapped Phillipa. ‘You’re too soft on him.’
Strike had the feeling this disproportionate anger wasn’t really about the dog.
‘When did Allie move to the farm?’ he asked.
‘Quite soon after we had them over for tea,’ said Mrs Graves.
‘And he was still on the dole at this point?’
‘Yerse,’ said the colonel, ‘but there’s a family trust. He’d been able to apply for funds from it, since he’d turned eighteen.’
Strike now took out his notebook and pen. Phillipa’s and Nicholas’ eyes followed these movements closely.
‘He started applying for money the moment he moved in with Mazu, but the trustees weren’t going to give him money just to fritter away,’ said the colonel. ‘Then Allie turned up here one day out of the blue to tell us Mazu was pregnant.’
‘He said he wanted money to get baby things, and make Mazu comfortable,’ said Mrs Graves.
‘Daiyu was born in May 1988, right?’ asked Strike.
‘That’s right,’ said Mrs Graves. The tremor in her hands was making every sip of tea risky. ‘Born at the farm. Allie rang us up, and we drove over right away, to see the baby. Mazu was lying in a filthy bed, nursing Daiyu, and Allie was very thin and jittery.’
‘As bad as he’d been before he was arrested,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Orf his medication. Told us he didn’t need it.’
‘We’d taken presents for Daiyu, and Mazu didn’t even thank us,’ said his wife. ‘But we kept visiting. We were worried about Allie, and about the baby, too, because the living conditions were quite unsanitary. Daiyu was very sweet, though. Looked just like Allie.’
‘Spittin’ image,’ said the colonel.
‘Except dark, and Allie was fair,’ said Mrs Graves.
‘Would you happen to have a picture of Allie?’ asked Strike.
‘Nick, could you—?’ asked Mrs Graves.
Nicholas reached behind him and extracted a framed photo from behind the one of Phillipa sitting on the large grey horse.
‘That’s Allie’s twenty-second,’ said Mrs Graves, as Nicholas passed the picture over the tea things. ‘When he was all right, before…’
The picture showed a group, at the centre of which stood a young man with a narrow head, blond hair and a distinctly rabbity face, though his lopsided grin was endearing. He greatly resembled the colonel.
‘Yes, Daiyu was very like him,’ said Strike.
‘How would you know?’ said Phillipa coldly.
‘I saw a photo of her in an old news report,’ Strike explained.
‘I always thought she was just like her mother, personally,’ said Phillipa.
Strike was scanning the rest of the group in the photograph. Phillipa was there, dark haired and stocky as she was in the hunting photograph, and beside her stood Nick, his hair military short, with his right arm in a sling.
‘Injured on exercises?’ Strike asked Nicholas, passing the photograph back.
‘What? Oh, no. Just a stupid accident.’
Nicholas took the photograph back from Strike and replaced it carefully, hiding it again behind the one of his wife on her magnificent hunter.
‘D’you remember Jonathan Wace coming to live at the farm?’ asked Strike.
‘Oh, yes,’ said Mrs Graves, quietly. ‘We were completely taken in. Thought he was the best thing about the place, didn’t we, Archie? And you liked him, didn’t you, Pips?’ she said timidly. ‘At first?’
‘He was politer than Mazu, that’s all,’ said the unsmiling Phillipa.
‘Fella seemed intelligent,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘One realised later it was all an act, but he was charmin’ when you first met him. Talked about the sustainable farming they were going to do. Made it sound quite worthy.’
‘I looked him up,’ said Nicholas. ‘He wasn’t lying. He had been to Harrow. Big in the drama society, apparently.’
‘He told us he was keeping an eye on Allie, Mazu and the baby,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Making sure they were all right. We thought he was a good thing, at the time.’
‘Then the religious stuff started creepin’ in,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Lectures on Eastern philosophy and what have yeh. Thought it was harmless at first. We were far more concerned about Allie’s mental state. The letters to the trustees kept comin’, clearly dictated by someone else. Passin’ himself orf as a partner in the farming business, y’know. Balderdash, but hard to disprove. They got a fair bit out of the trust, one way or another.’
‘Every time we visited the farm, Allie was worse,’ said Mrs Graves, ‘and we could tell there was something between Mazu and Jonathan.’
‘Only time she ever cracked a smile was when Wace was around,’ said Colonel Graves.
‘And she’d started treating Allie awf’ly,’ said Mrs Graves. ‘Spiteful, y’know. “Stop babbling.” “Stop making a fool of yourself.”’ And Allie was chanting and fasting and whatever else Jonathan was making him do.’
‘We wanted Allie to see another doctor, but he said medicines were poison, and he’d be fine as long as kept his spirit pure,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Then, one day, Baba visited – you two were with her, werencha?’
‘Yes,’ said Phillipa stiffly. ‘We’d just got back from our honeymoon. We took photos of the wedding with us. I don’t know why. It’s not as though Allie was interested. And there was a row.
‘They claimed to be offended we hadn’t asked Daiyu to be a flower girl,’ she said, with a little laugh. ‘Such nonsense. We’d sent Allie and Mazu invitations, but we knew they wouldn’t come. Jonathan wouldn’t let Allie leave the farm by then, except to collect money on the street. The flower girl thing was just an excuse to wind Allie up and make him think we all hated him and his child.’
‘Not that we wanted her as a flower girl,’ said Nicholas. ‘She was—’
His wife shot him a look and he fell silent.
‘Allie was making no sense at all that day,’ said Mrs Graves desperately. ‘I said to Mazu, “He’s got to see someone. He’s got to see a doctor.”’
‘Wace told us Allie just needed to clear his ego, and balls like that,’ said Nicholas. ‘And I bloody well let him have it. Told him, if he wanted to live like a pig that was his business, and if he wanted to spout crap at credulous morons who’d pay for the pleasure, fine, but the family had bloody well had enough of it. And I said to Allie, “If you can’t see this for the bollocks it is, then you’re even more of a fool than I thought you were, you need your head sorted out, now get in the bloody car—”’
‘But he wouldn’t come,’ said Mrs Graves, ‘and then Mazu said she was going to take out a restraining order against us. She was pleased there’d been a row. It’s what she wanted.’
‘That’s when we decided somethin’ had to be done,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘I hired O’Connor, the detective chappie I told you about on th’phone. Brief was to dig inter Mazu and Wace’s backgrounds, get somethin’ we could use against them.’
‘Did he get anything?’ asked Strike, his pen poised.
‘Got a bit on the gel. Found out she was born at Chapman Farm. He thought she was one of the Crowthers’ children – yeh know about that business? Mother was dead. She’d left the gel at the farm and gawn orf to work as a prostitute in London. Drug overdose. Pauper’s grave.
‘Wace was clearly a wastrel, but no criminal convictions. Parents were in South Africa. His first wife’s death seemed to have been a pure accident. So we thought: desperate times call for desperate measures. We had O’Connor watchin’ the farm. We knew Allie sometimes went inter Norwich to collect money.
‘We grabbed him orf the street, me, m’brother-in-law and Nick,’ Colonel Graves continued. ‘Bundled him into the back of the car and drove him back hyar. He was goin’ berserk. We dragged him inside, into this room, and kept him here all afternoon and most of the night, tryin’ to talk some sense into him.’
‘He just kept chanting and telling us he had to go back to temple,’ said Mrs Graves hopelessly.
‘We called the local GP,’ said the colonel. ‘He didn’t come until late the next day. Young fella, new at the practice. Moment he walked in, Allie pulled himself together enough to say we’d kidnapped him and were forcin’ him to stay here. Said he wanted to go back to Chapman Farm and begged the chap to get the police.
‘Moment the doctor left, Allie started screamin’ and throwing around furniture – if that bloody GP could’ve seen him like that – and while he was chucking things around, his shirt came untucked and we saw marks on his back. Bruising and welts.’
‘I said to him, “What have they done to you, Allie?”’ said Mrs Graves tearfully, ‘But he wouldn’t answer.’
‘We got him upstairs again, into his old room,’ said Colonel Graves, ‘and he locked the door on us. I was worried he was goin’ to climb out of the window so I went out onto the lawn to keep watch. Worried he’d jump, y’see, tryin’ to get back to Chapman Farm. I was there all night.
‘Early next mornin’, two police officers came round. Tipped orf by the GP we were holdin’ a man against his will. We explained what was goin’ on. We wanted emergency services out to see him. The police said they needed to meet him first, so I went upstairs to get him. Knocked. No answer. Got worried. Nick and I broke down the door.’
Colonel Graves swallowed, then said quietly,
‘He was dead. Hanged himself with a belt, orf a hook on the back of the door.’
There was a brief silence, broken only by the fat Labrador’s snores.
‘I’m sorry,’ said Strike. ‘Appalling for you all.’
Mrs Graves, who was now wiping her eyes with a lace handkerchief, whispered,
‘Excuse me.’
She got to her feet and shuffled out of the room. Looking cross, Phillipa followed.
‘One looks back,’ said the old man quietly, once his daughter had closed the door behind her, ‘and thinks “What could we’ve done diff’rently?” If I had to do it all again, I think I’d still’ve forced him into that car, but driven him straight to a hospital. Got him sectioned. But he was terrified of being locked up. I thought he’d never forgive us.’
‘And it might have ended the same way,’ said Strike.
‘Yerse,’ said Colonel Graves, looking directly at the detective. ‘I’ve thought that since, too. Out of his mind. We were too late, by the time we got hold of him. Should’ve acted years before.’
‘There was a post-mortem, I take it?’
Colonel Graves nodded.
‘No surprises on cause of death, but we wanted a professional view on the marks on his back. The police went to th’farm. Wace and Mazu claimed he’d done it to himself, and other church members backed them up.’
‘They claimed he whipped himself?’
‘Said he felt sinful and was mortifyin’ his own flesh… couldn’t pour me another cup of tea, couldja, Nick?’
Strike watched Nicholas fiddling with the hot water and tea-strainer and wondered why some people resisted teabags. Once the colonel was provided with a refilled cup, Strike asked,
‘Can you remember the names of these people who saw Allie whipping himself?’
‘Not any more. Load of shysters. Coroner’s report was inconclusive. They thought it was possible Allie’d done it to himself. Hard t’get past eyewitnesses.’
Strike made a note, then said,
‘I’ve heard Allie made a will.’
‘Right after Daiyu was born,’ said Colonel Graves, nodding. ‘They used a solicitor in Norwich, not the firm th’family’s always used.’
The old man glanced at the door through which his wife and daughter had disappeared, then said in a lower voice,
‘In it, Allie stipulated that, if he died, he wanted to be buried at Chapman Farm. Made me think Mazu already expected him to die young. Wanted control of him, even in death. Damn’ near broke m’wife’s heart. They shut us out of the funeral. Didn’t even tell us when it was happenin’. No goodbye, nothin’.’
‘And how was Allie’s estate left?’
‘Everythin’ went to Daiyu,’ said Colonel Graves.
‘There wasn’t much to leave, presumably, as he’d got through his inheritance?’
‘Well, no,’ said Colonel Graves with a sigh, ‘as a matter of fact, he had some stocks and shares, rather valuable ones, left to him by m’uncle, who never married. Allie was named after him, so he, ah –’ Colonel Graves glanced at Nicholas ‘– yerse, well, he left it all to Allie. We think Allie either forgot he had the shares, or was too unwell to know how to turn them into cash. We weren’t in any hurry to remind him about them. Not that we were stintin’ Mazu and the baby! The family trust was always there for anythin’ the child needed. But yerse, Allie had a lot of investments he hadn’t touched, and they were steadily accruin’ in value.’
‘Can I ask what they were worth?’
‘Quarter of a million,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Those went straight to Daiyu when Allie died – and she was also in line to inherit this place,’ said Colonel Graves.
‘Really?’
‘Yerse,’ said Colonel Graves, with a hollow laugh. ‘None of us saw that comin’. Lawyers wanted to go through everything after Allie died, and they dug out the entail. I’m certain m’grandfather meant the house was t’go to the eldest son in every generation. That’s what was usual at the time, y’know – the place has come down from m’grandfather to m’father and then to me – nobody had checked the paperwork in decades, never needed to. But when Allie died, we dug the papers out, and blow me down, it said “eldest child”. ’Course, over generations, the first child had always been a son. Maybe m’grandfather didn’t imagine a gel coming first.’
The sitting room door opened and Mrs Graves and Phillipa returned to the room. Phillipa assisted her mother to resume her seat while Strike was still writing down the details of Daiyu’s considerable inheritance.
‘I understand you tried to get custody of Daiyu, after Allie died?’ he asked, looking up again.
‘’S’right,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘Mazu was refusin’ to let us see her. Then she married Wace. Well, I was damned if Allie’s daughter was goin’ to grow up there to be whipped and abused and all the rest of it. So, we initiated custody proceedin’s. We got O’Connor back on the case and he tracked down a couple of people who’d been for meditation sessions at the farm, who said the children at the farm were bein’ neglected, underweight and runnin’ round in inadequate clothin’, no schoolin’ and so on.’
‘Is this when Mazu started claiming Wace was Daiyu’s real father?’ said Strike.
‘Know that already, do yeh?’ said the colonel approvingly. ‘Huh. Trust a Red Cap. Trust th’army!’ he said, with a smirk at his son-in-law, who looked ostentatiously bored. ‘Yerse, they started claiming she hadn’t been Allie’s child at all. If we got her back, they lost control of those shares, y’see? So we thought, “Fine, let’s prove who the father was,” and pressed for a DNA sample. We were still tryin’ to get the DNA when the call came through. It was Mazu. She said, “She’s dead.”’ Colonel Graves mimed putting down an invisible telephone receiver. ‘Click… We thought she was being malicious. Thought maybe she’d taken Daiyu somewhere and hidden her – playin’ a game, d’yeh see? But next day we saw it in the newspapers. Drowned. No body. Just swept out to sea.’
‘Did you attend the inquest?’ asked Strike.
‘Damn right we did,’ said Colonel Graves loudly. ‘They couldn’t stop us goin’ to the coroner’s court.’
‘Were you there for the whole thing?’
‘All of it,’ said Colonel Graves, nodding. ‘All of them arrivin’ to watch, in their robes and what have you. Wace and Mazu turned up in a brand-new Mercedes. Coroner was concerned about the lack of a body. She would be, of course. Hardly usual. It was the coroner’s neck on the block if she got it wrong. But the coastguard confirmed they’d had a strong rip tide around there for a few days.
‘They brought in an expert witness chap, search and rescue type, who said bodies can sink in cold water and not come up for a long time, or get caught up in somethin’ on the seabed. Yeh could see the coroner was relieved. Made it all nice and easy. And witnesses had seen the gel, Cherie, takin’ her down onto the beach. The retarded boy—’
‘It’s “learning disability” these days, Archie,’ said Nicholas, who seemed to enjoy correcting his father-in-law, after his crack about the army’s superiority to the navy. ‘Can’t say things like that.’
‘Comes t’the same thing, doesn’t it?’ said Colonel Graves irritably.
‘You’re lucky you don’t have to deal with the bloody education system any more,’ said Nicholas. ‘You’d be in a lot of trouble there for callin’ a spade a spade.’
‘Was the witness called Paul Draper?’ asked Strike.
‘Can’t remember the name. Short boy. Vacant look. Seemed scared. Thought he was in trouble, y’know, because he’d seen the gel Cherie drivin’ Daiyu out of the farm.’
‘The people who saw the van leaving the farm did get in trouble,’ said Strike. ‘They were punished for not stopping it.’
‘Well, that’ll all have been part of the Waces’ act, won’t it?’ said the colonel, frowning at Strike. ‘Probably told the gel to make sure people saw them leavin’, so they could give the witnesses hell afterwards. Pretend they weren’t behind it.’
‘You think the Waces ordered Cherie to drown her?’
‘Oh, yerse,’ said the old soldier. ‘Yerse, I do. She was worth a quarter of a million, dead. And they didn’t give up hope of gettin’ their hands on this house, either, until we’d spent more money on lawyers to shake ’em orf.’
‘Tell me about Cherie,’ said Strike.
‘Feather-brained,’ said Colonel Graves at once. ‘Blubbed a lot in the witness box. Guilty conscience. Clear as day. I don’t say the gel ackshly pushed Daiyu under. Just took her there in the dark, where they knew there was a strong current, and let nature take its course. Wouldn’t be difficult. Why were they swimmin’ at all, that time in the mornin’?’
‘Did you by any chance put O’Connor onto Cherie Gittins?’
‘Oh yerse. He tracked her down to a cousin’s house in Dulwich. “Cherie Gittins” wasn’t her real name – she was a runaway. Real name was Carine Makepeace.’
‘That,’ said Strike, making another note, ‘is extremely useful information.’
‘Goin’ t’find her?’ said the colonel.
‘If I can,’ said Strike.
‘Good,’ said Colonel Graves. ‘She got the wind up when O’Connor approached her. Took off next day and he wasn’t able to find her again – but she’s the one who really knows what happened. She’s the key.’
‘Well,’ said Strike, looking over his notes, ‘I think that’s everything I had to ask. I’m very grateful for your time. This has been extremely helpful.’
‘I’ll see you out,’ said Phillipa, getting unexpectedly to her feet.
‘G’bye,’ said the colonel, holding out his hand to Strike. ‘Keep us posted if you turn up anythin’, what?’
‘I will,’ Strike assured him. ‘Thanks very much for the tea and cake, Mrs Graves.’
‘I do hope you find something,’ said Allie’s mother earnestly.
The elderly Labrador woke up at the sound of footsteps and lolloped after Strike and Phillipa as they left the room. The latter maintained her silence until they’d descended the steps onto the gravel forecourt. The dog waddled past them until he reached an immaculate stretch of lawn, upon which he crouched and set about producing a turd remarkable for its size.
‘I want to say something to you,’ said Phillipa.
Strike turned to look at her. Wearing the same kind of flat pumps favoured by the late Princess Diana, Phillipa was a full eight inches shorter than he was, and had to throw her head back to look at him with her chilly blue eyes.
‘Nothing good,’ said Phillipa Graves, ‘can come of you digging around into Daiyu’s death. Nothing.’
Strike had met other people during his detective career who’d expressed similar sentiments, but he’d never managed to muster any sympathy for them. Truth, to Strike, was sacrosanct. Justice was the only other value he held as high.
‘What makes you say that?’ he asked, as politely as he could manage.
‘Obviously, the Waces did it,’ said Phillipa. ‘We know that. We’ve always known it.’
He looked down at her, as baffled as he’d have been on meeting an entirely new species.
‘And you don’t want to see them in court?’
‘No,’ said Phillipa defiantly. ‘I simply don’t care. All I want is to forget about the whole bloody thing. My whole childhood – my whole life, before he killed himself – was Allie, Allie, Allie. Allie’s naughty, Allie’s ill, where’s Allie, what shall we do about Allie, Allie’s had a baby, what shall we do about Allie’s baby, let’s throw more money at him, now it’s Allie and Daiyu, you will invite them to your wedding, won’t you, darling, poor Allie, crazy Allie, dead Allie.’
Strike wouldn’t have been surprised to learn it was the first time Phillipa Graves had ever said these things. Her face had turned red and she was shaking slightly, not like her mother, but because every muscle was knotted with rage.
‘And no sooner has he gone than it’s Daiyu, Daiyu, Daiyu. They hardly noticed my first child being born, it was still Allie, all Allie – and Daiyu was a horrible child. We’re not supposed to say it, Nick and I, oh no, I was supposed to stand aside, all over again, for that vile woman’s child, and pretend I loved her and wanted her to come here, to our family home, and inherit it. You think you’re going to be doing something wonderful, don’t you, proving they did it? Well, I’ll tell you what that will achieve. Allie, Allie, Allie for the family, all over again, masses of publicity, my children asked at school all about their murdered cousin and their uncle the suicide – The Stolen Prophet and the Drowned Prophet, I know what they call them – it’ll be books, probably, if you prove they drowned her, not just the newspapers – and my children will have to have Allie hanging over them forever, too. And you think, if you prove they killed her, it’ll stop that damned church? Of course it won’t. The UHC isn’t going anywhere, whatever you might think. So idiots want to go there and be whipped by the Waces – well, it’s their choice, isn’t it? Who are you actually helping?’
The front door of Garvestone Hall opened again. Nick walked slowly down onto the gravel, frowning slightly. He was a fit-looking man, Strike saw now: almost as tall as the detective.
‘Ev’rythin’ all right, Pips?’
Phillipa turned to her husband.
‘I’m just telling him,’ she said furiously, ‘how we feel.’
‘You agree with your wife, do you, Mr – sorry, I don’t know your surname,’ said Strike.
‘Delaunay,’ said Nicholas coldly, placing a hand on his wife’s shoulder. ‘Yes, I do. The potential repercussions to our family could be severe. And after all,’ he said, ‘there no bringing Daiyu back, is there?’
‘On the contrary,’ said Strike. ‘My information is, the church brings her back regularly. Well, thanks for your time.’
He heard the slam of the oak front door over the sound of his starting engine. The Labrador, forgotten on the lawn, watched Strike reverse the car then pull away, its tail still vaguely wagging.
