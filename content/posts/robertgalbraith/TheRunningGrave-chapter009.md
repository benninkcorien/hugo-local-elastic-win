The Running Grave
9
But in abolishing abuses one must not be too hasty. This would turn out badly because the abuses have been in existence so long.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Robin’s neck felt exposed and chilly as she travelled by train to Prudence’s house in Strawberry Hill the following evening. She sincerely hoped the accountant would let her claim at least half the cost of her new haircut as a business expense, because it was the most expensive she’d ever had. Chin-length, with a long, graduated fringe, with the ends bleached and then dyed pale blue. After one look of shock, Murphy had beamed and told her he liked it upon meeting the previous evening, which, true or not, had made her feel slightly less self-conscious as they entered the Duke of York Theatre, to watch The Father.
‘Blue, eh?’ were Strike’s first words, when Robin got into the BMW outside Strawberry Hill station. ‘Looks good.’
‘Thanks. I’m hoping it also says, “Hi, I’ve got more money than sense.”’
‘Maybe once you’ve got the posh clothes on,’ said Strike, pulling out of the car park.
‘How was Bigfoot?’ Robin asked, as they drove past a long line of solid Edwardian villas.
‘Disappointingly celibate,’ said Strike. ‘But for a man who’s worth a couple of million, you’d think he could afford a comb.’
‘You really don’t like scruffiness, do you?’ said Robin, amused.
‘Not in people who have a choice. How hard is it to bloody wash?’
Strike took a right turn before saying,
‘Dev found the bloke Shanker’s after, by the way.’
‘Oh good,’ said Robin. While she was under no illusions about Shanker’s deeply criminal nature, he happened to have once helped her escape an assault by a large murder suspect, for which she remained grateful. ‘How’s the little girl doing?’
‘He didn’t say, but hopefully seeing her dad will cheer her up… here we go…’
Earlier than Robin had expected, they turned into the drive of a particularly large Edwardian house, which not only made Robin feel slightly intimidated, but also made her think ruefully of her own flimsily built flat, in which she had to endure the almost constant noise of the music from the man upstairs.
The front door opened before they reached it, revealing Strike’s half-sister, who was the daughter of a well-known actress and the rock star who’d also fathered Strike. Prudence was wearing a plain black dress that looked unexceptional to Strike, but which Robin guessed would have cost the equivalent of her own monthly mortgage repayment.
Like Sir Colin Edensor, Prudence had the kind of face it was hard to dislike, or so thought Robin. Though not quite as beautiful as her actress mother, she was very attractive, with freckled skin and long, wavy black hair. Eyes that slanted upwards at the corners and a small, smiling mouth added a slightly Puckish look. Though by no means overweight, she was curvy, something Robin, who’d been afraid she’d be stick thin and flat-chested, saw with relief.
‘Come in, come in! It’s so nice to meet you,’ said Prudence, beaming as she shook Robin’s hand.
‘You, too. My hair isn’t usually like this,’ Robin said, and then wished she hadn’t. She’d just caught sight of her reflection in Prudence’s hall mirror. ‘It’s all part of my cover.’
‘Well, it looks great,’ said Prudence, before turning to Strike and hugging him.
‘Blimey, bruv, well done. There’s less of you every time I see you.’
‘If I’d known it would make everyone this happy, I’d’ve got the other leg amputated.’
‘Very funny. Come on through to the sitting room. I’ve just opened some wine.’
She led the two detectives into a large room of exquisite taste. Beautifully proportioned, with large black and white photographs on the walls, stacked bookcases and a low, dark leather sofa on a tubular metal frame, it managed to be simultaneously stylish and welcoming.
‘So,’ said Prudence, gesturing Strike and Robin to the sofa and settling into a large cream armchair before pouring two extra glasses of wine, ‘clothes. Do I get to ask what they’re for?’
‘Robin needs to look like a rich girl who’s at enough of a loose end to joint a cult.’
‘A cult?’
‘Well, that’s what some people would say it is,’ temporised Robin. ‘They’ve got a kind of compound in the countryside, and I’m hoping to be recruited so I can get in there.’
To both detectives’ surprise, Prudence’s smile disappeared and was replaced with a look of concern.
‘This wouldn’t be the UHC, would it?’
Startled, Robin glanced at Strike.
‘That’s a very swift bit of deduction,’ he said. ‘Why d’you think it would be them?’
‘Because it started in Norfolk.’
‘You’ve got a client who was in there,’ said Strike, on a sudden hunch.
‘I don’t bandy around clients’ identifying details, Cormoran,’ said Prudence, her voice mock-stern as she pushed his glass towards him across the coffee table.
‘Pity,’ said Strike lightly. ‘We need to find ex-members.’
Prudence looked intently at him for a moment or two, then said,
‘Well, as I’ve got a duty of confidentiality, I can’t—’
‘I was being glib,’ Strike reassured her. ‘I’m not after a name and address.’
Prudence took a sip of wine, her expression grave. Finally, she said,
‘I don’t think you’ll find it very easy, getting ex-members to talk. There’s a lot of shame attached to having been coerced in that way, and often significant trauma.’
Seeing them face to face, Robin spotted her partner’s resemblance to Jonny Rokeby for the first time. He and his half-sister shared the same defined jaw, the same spacing of the eyes. She wondered – she who had three brothers, all of the same parentage – what it felt like, to make a first acquaintance with a blood relative in your forties. But there was something more there than a faint physical resemblance between brother and sister: they appeared, already, to have established an unspoken understanding.
‘All right,’ said Prudence, under Strike’s semi-jocular questioning, ‘I do treat an ex-UHC member. As a matter of fact, when they first disclosed what had happened to them, I didn’t think I was the right person to help them. It’s specialised work, deprogramming people. Some over-indulge in things they were deprived of inside – food and alcohol, for instance. Some indulge in risky behaviours, as a reaction to being so controlled and monitored. Readjusting to a life of freedom isn’t easy, and being asked to disinter things they suffered, or were forced to do, can be immensely distressing.
‘Luckily, I knew of an American therapist who’s worked with a lot of cult survivors, so I got in touch with him. He did a few virtual sessions with the client, which helped hugely, and I’ve now taken over, with some continued assistance from the American. That’s how I know about the UHC.’
‘How did the client get out?’ asked Strike.
‘Why? Is that what you’ve been hired to do, get someone out?’
Strike nodded.
‘Then you need to be very careful,’ said Prudence seriously. ‘If they’re anything like my client, they’ll be exceptionally fragile and you’ll do more harm than good if you’re heavy-handed. You’ve got to understand: people in cults have been rewired. Expecting them to just snap back to normal isn’t realistic.’
‘How did your client manage it?’
‘They… didn’t leave by choice,’ said Prudence hesitantly.
‘You mean they were expelled?’
‘It wasn’t a question of… they had health issues,’ said Prudence, ‘but I can’t say more than that. Suffice to say, the UHC doesn’t let members leave through the front door unless they’ve stopped being of use. You’ll need to be very careful, Robin. Have you ever read Robert Jay Lifton? Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism? Or Combatting Cult Mind Control, by Steven Hassan?’
Robin shook her head.
‘I’ll lend you my copies. I’ll give them to you before you go. Being able to identify their techniques will help you resist them.’
‘Robin’s smart,’ said Strike. ‘She’s not going to buy whatever they’re selling.’
‘Being clever’s no protection, not on its own,’ said Prudence. ‘Restricted food, enforced chanting, rigid control over your physical environment, digging into your psyche for the places they can apply most pressure, love-bombing you one minute, tearing you down the next… nobody’s invulnerable to that, clever or not…
‘Anyway,’ said Prudence, standing up, ‘let’s try on some clothes.’
‘This is really kind of you, Prudence,’ Robin said, as the therapist led her upstairs.
‘It isn’t,’ said Prudence, now smiling again. ‘I’ve been dying to meet you, given that you’re clearly the most important person in Corm’s life.’
The words gave Robin a sensation like an electric shock in the pit of her stomach.
‘He’s – he’s really important to me, too.’
They passed the open door of a very messy bedroom, which Robin could tell belonged to a teenager even before a black-haired girl in a mini-skirt came bounding out of it, clutching a leather jacket in one hand, and a satchel in the other.
‘Ooh,’ she said, blinking at Robin. ‘Cool hair!’
Without waiting for a response she hurried past them, running downstairs. Prudence called after her,
‘Text me when you need picking up!’
‘I will,’ shouted the girl, and they heard her call, ‘Laters, new uncle,’ before the front door slammed.
‘That was Sylvie,’ said Prudence, leading Robin into a large bedroom of luxurious simplicity, and then into a mirrored dressing room lined with clothing racks. ‘Corm said you’d need two or three outfits?’
‘Ideally,’ said Robin. ‘I promise I’ll be very careful with them.’
‘Oh, don’t worry about that, I’ve got far too many clothes… it’s my weakness,’ Prudence admitted, with a guilty smile. ‘Sylvie’s just got old enough to start borrowing stuff I can’t get away with any more, so I’m kind of hanging off giving it all to charity. What size shoes do you take?’
‘Six,’ said Robin, ‘but—’
‘Perfect. Same as me.’
‘—you really don’t have to—’
‘If you’re trying to look wealthy, accessories count,’ said Prudence. ‘Quite exciting really, helping someone go undercover. Corm’s very cagey about what you two get up to – professionally, I mean,’ she added.
She began pulling out day dresses and various tops and handing them to Robin, who saw labels she could never have afforded: Valentino, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent.
‘… and that would really suit you,’ Prudence said five minutes later, adding a Chloé dress to the heavy load Robin was already holding. ‘Right, try it all on and see what works. You’ll be completely private in here, Declan’s not home for another hour.’
As the bedroom door closed behind Prudence, Robin put the pile of clothes down on the double bed, then took off her sweater and jeans, looking around at the room as she did so. From the oak floorboards and the wide mahogany sleigh bed to the sleek, modern chandelier, long gauze curtains and wall-mounted flat-screen television, everything spoke of good taste and plenty of money. Strike might be living like this, Robin thought, if he’d swallow his pride and rage, and accept his father’s largesse – though, of course, she couldn’t be sure it was Jonny Rokeby who’d bought this house.
Downstairs, Prudence had rejoined Strike in the sitting room, holding two books.
‘For Robin,’ she said, putting them on the coffee table between them.
‘Cheers,’ he said, as she refilled his wine glass. ‘Listen, can I ask you something?’
‘Go on,’ said Prudence, sitting down opposite him.
‘Did this client of yours ever witness supernatural events at Chapman Farm?’
‘Corm, I can’t talk about that.’
‘I’m not going to go looking for your client,’ he assured her. ‘I’m just interested.’
‘I’ve probably said too much already,’ said Prudence.
‘I get it,’ said Strike. ‘No more questions.’
Leaning forwards, he picked up Combatting Cult Mind Control, turned it over and read the blurb on the back.
‘You’ve got me more worried about Robin going in there now than I was half an hour ago,’ he admitted.
‘Good,’ said Prudence. ‘Sorry, I don’t mean “good, you’re worried”, I just think it’s best she understands what she’s getting into.’
‘Why the hell do people join cults?’ mused Strike. ‘Why would anyone give over that amount of control of their lives?’
‘Because they don’t realise total control is where it’s going to end,’ said Prudence. ‘It happens incrementally, step by step, after they’ve been offered approval and validation and a sense of purpose… surely you can see the allure of discovering a profound truth? The key to the universe?’
Strike half-shrugged.
‘OK, well, what about believing you can make a real difference to the world: alleviate suffering, cure social ills, protect the weak?’
‘Why d’you need to be in a cult to do any of that?’
‘You don’t,’ said Prudence, smiling, ‘but they’re very good at convincing people membership is the best possible way of achieving paradise on earth, not to mention heaven afterwards.
‘The only kind of people the UHC probably couldn’t do much with, not that they’d want to recruit them in the first place, are apathetic, couch-potato types. The UHC’s after idealists they can turn into evangelists, although I believe they have lower grades of recruit at Chapman Farm, just to get the actual farming done… my poor client knows only too well that other people think they’re stupid and weak-willed for having fallen for it all, which is part of the reason they feel so much shame. But the truth is, being idealistic and intellectually inquiring makes you much more vulnerable to ideologies like the UHC’s… will you two stay for dinner? It’s pasta, nothing fancy.’
‘You don’t have to feed us as well,’ said Strike.
‘I want to. Please stay, Declan will be home soon. Robin seems lovely, by the way.’
‘Yeah, she is,’ said Strike, glancing up at the ceiling.
Upstairs, Robin had decided on her three outfits, though she still felt diffident about taking such expensive clothes away with her. She’d just got back into her own jeans and top when Prudence knocked on the door.
‘Come in,’ called Robin.
‘Chosen?’
‘Yes. If it’s OK, I’d like to borrow these.’
‘Great,’ said Prudence, scooping up the rest of the clothes and heading back towards the rails to put them back on hangers. ‘You know what?’ she said, over her shoulder, ‘You should just keep them. It’s easier.’
‘Prudence – I can’t,’ said Robin weakly. She knew perfectly well that the clothes she’d selected were worth at least two thousand pounds, even second-hand.
‘Why not? If you’d wanted this,’ said Prudence, holding up the Chloé dress, ‘I’d’ve asked for it back, because Declan really likes me in it, but honestly, I easily can do without what you’ve chosen. I’ve already got too much stuff, you can see that. Please,’ she said, as Robin opened her mouth to protest again, ‘it’ll be the first time any of us have been allowed to give Corm anything, even by proxy. Now let’s find shoes.’
‘I really don’t know what to say,’ Robin said, flummoxed. She was worried Strike wouldn’t be happy she’d accepted the gift. As though she’d read Robin’s mind, Prudence said,
‘I know Corm’s touchy as hell about taking anything from Dad, but none of this was bought by Jonny Rokeby, I promise. I make very good money and Declan earns a mint. Come here and choose shoes,’ she added, beckoning Robin back into the dressing room. ‘These look great with that dress. Try them.’
As Robin slid a foot into a Jimmy Choo pump, she asked,
‘Are you close to your dad?’
‘Um…’ said Prudence, now on her knees as she rifled through her boots, ‘… I suppose as close as you can ever be with someone like him. He’s kind of juvenile. They say you remain forever stuck at the age you got famous, don’t they? Which means Dad’s never really aged out of his late teens. His whole mindset’s instant gratification and letting other people pick up the pieces. I am fond of him, but he’s not a parent in the usual sense, because he’s never really needed to look after himself, let alone anyone else. I can see exactly why Corm’s pissed off at him, though. You could hardly imagine two more different people. Try these,’ she added, handing Robin a pair of boots. As Robin pulled them on, Prudence added,
‘Dad’s got a genuinely guilty conscience about Corm. He knows he behaved really badly. He tried to reach out a couple of years ago. I don’t know exactly what was said—’
‘Rokeby offered him money to meet,’ said Robin baldly.
Prudence winced.
‘Oh God, I didn’t know that… Dad would’ve thought that was generous or something… bloody idiot… he’s so used to throwing money at problems… Those look too tight.’
‘They are, a bit,’ Robin admitted, unzipping the boots again. ‘You know,’ she added impulsively, ‘I’m really glad you and Cormoran are in touch. I think you might be… I don’t know… what he’s missing.’
‘Really?’ said Prudence, looking pleased. ‘Because I’ve wanted to meet him for years. Years. It isn’t easy, being the biracial illegitimate among the rest of them. We all get on all right, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve always been sort of half-in, half-out of the Rokeby clan, and knowing Corm was out there, not giving a damn, making his own way…
‘Of course, he’s perennially scared I’m going to start psychoanalysing him,’ added Prudence, now handing Robin a pair of Manolo Blahniks. ‘I’ve explained to him multiple times that I wouldn’t be able to, even if I wanted. The relationship’s too… it’s just too complicated… he’s been a kind of talisman to me for a long time. Just the idea of him. You can’t be objective with somebody like that, ever… You’ll stay for dinner, won’t you? I’ve just asked Corm.’
‘I – are you sure?’ said Robin, feeling slightly overwhelmed.
‘God, yes, it’ll be fun. Declan really likes Corm and he’ll be thrilled to meet you. OK, so you’re going to take these three, right?’ said Prudence, setting aside another few hundred pounds’ worth of footwear. ‘Now let’s find a handbag…’
Downstairs in the silent sitting room, Strike was again poring over the photograph of Kevin Pirbright’s room that Wardle had given him, and which he’d brought with him to show Robin. For several minutes, he’d been squinting at it, trying to make out a few things that puzzled him. Finally he glanced around and spotted exactly what he required: an antique magnifying glass lying decoratively on top of a pile of art books.
Ten minutes later, Robin reappeared in the sitting room and emitted a surprised laugh.
‘What?’ said Strike, looking up.
‘Sherlock Holmes, I presume?’
‘Don’t mock it until you’ve tried it,’ said Strike, holding out both photo and magnifying glass. ‘This is Kevin Pirbright’s room, as the police found it. Wardle got it for me.’
‘Oh,’ said Robin. She sat back down on the sofa beside Strike and took both picture and magnifying glass from him.
‘Have a shufti at what he’s written on the walls,’ said Strike. ‘See whether you can read any of it. That picture’s all we’ve got, unfortunately, because I called the landlord this afternoon. Once the police had finished with it, he repainted the room.’
Robin moved the magnifying glass to and fro, trying to make out the scrawled words. She was concentrating so hard, the sound of the front door banging open made her jump.
‘Hi, new uncle,’ said a dark teenaged boy, poking his head into the room. He seemed disconcerted to find Robin there, as well.
‘Hi, Gerry,’ said Strike. ‘This is my detective partner, Robin.’
‘Oh,’ said the boy, looking vaguely embarrassed. ‘Cool. Hi.’
He disappeared again.
Robin resumed her close examination of the photo. After a minute’s intense concentration, she began to read aloud.
‘“Five prophets”… what’s that over the mirror? Is it “retribution”?’
‘I think so,’ said Strike, shifting closer to her on the sofa, so their thighs were almost touching.
Many of the scrawls on Pirbright’s walls were illegible, or too small to read from the photograph, but here and there, a word stood out.
‘“Becca”,’ read Robin. ‘“Sin”… “stra” something… straw? “I think that’s “plot”, isn’t it?’
‘Yeah,’ said Strike.
‘“The night before”… the night before… I can’t read the rest…’
‘Nor can I. What d’you make of that?’
Strike was pointing at something on the wall over the unmade bed. As both leaned in to look closer, Strike’s hair brushed Robin’s and she felt another small electric shock in the pit of her stomach.
‘It looks,’ she said, ‘as though someone’s tried to scrub something off… or… have they chipped away the plaster?’
‘That’s what I thought,’ said Strike. ‘Looks to me like someone’s literally gouged some of the writing off the wall, but they didn’t take it all. Wardle told me Pirbright’s neighbour came banging on the door after hearing his music stop. Possibly that persuaded the killer to leave via the window, before they’d had time to remove the whole thing.’
‘And they left that,’ said Robin, looking at the last remnant of what seemed to have been a sentence or phrase.
Written in capitals and circled many times was a single, easily legible word: PIGS.
