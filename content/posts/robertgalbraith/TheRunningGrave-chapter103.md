The Running Grave
103
In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly… When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its progress…
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Robin entered the office first, with Strike just behind her. Will Edensor was sitting on the sofa by Pat’s desk, wearing his blue tracksuit, which was not only filthy, but torn at the knees. He looked even thinner than when Robin had last seen him, although perhaps she’d simply become re-habituated to people who looked decently fed. At Will’s feet sat an old plastic bag that appeared to contain some large, solid object, and on his lap sat little Qing, who was also wearing a blue tracksuit, and eating a chocolate biscuit with an expression of ecstasy on her face.
Will turned scarlet when he saw Robin.
‘Hi Will,’ she said.
Will looked down at the floor. Even his ears were red.
‘That child needs some proper food,’ said Pat, sounding as though this was Strike and Robin’s fault. ‘We’ve only got biscuits.’
‘Good thinking,’ said Strike, pulling out his wallet, ‘could you get us all some pizza, Pat?’
Pat took the notes Strike had handed her, pulled on her coat and left the office. Robin wheeled Pat’s computer chair out from behind the desk to sit down at a short distance from Will and Qing. Strike, conscious of looming over everyone, went to the cupboard to take out one of the folding plastic chairs. Will sat hunchbacked, holding his daughter, blushing furiously, staring at the carpet. Qing, who was munching her biscuit, was easily the most at ease person in the room.
‘It’s great to see you, Will,’ said Robin. ‘Hello, Qing,’ she added, smiling.
‘More!’ said the toddler, stretching out her hands towards the biscuit tin on Pat’s desk.
Robin took out two chocolate fingers and gave them to her. Will remained hunched over, as though in pain, holding Qing around her middle. Strike, who had no idea that the last time Will had seen Robin he’d been naked and masturbating – Robin’s account had left her partner assuming both had been fully clothed when Will had thrown his punch – assumed his embarrassment stemmed from having hit her.
‘How did you get out?’ Robin asked Will, while Qing munched joyfully.
She hadn’t forgotten what Will had done to her in the Retreat Room, but at the moment that was of far less importance to her than the extraordinary fact that he’d left Chapman Farm.
‘Climbed over the wall at the blind spot,’ he muttered. ‘Same as you.’
‘By night?’
‘No, because I had to bring Qing.’
He forced himself to look up at Robin, but was unable to hold her gaze long, and instead addressed the leg of Pat’s desk.
‘I’ve got to find out where Lin is,’ he said, a little desperately.
‘We’re looking for her,’ Robin assured him.
‘Why?’
‘Because,’ said Robin, before Strike could say anything tactless about Lin’s potential usefulness in discrediting the church, ‘we care about her. I was there, remember, when she was miscarrying?’
‘Oh, yeah,’ said Will. ‘I forgot… they’ve got centres in Birmingham and Glasgow, you know,’ he added.
‘Yes, we know,’ said Robin. ‘But we think she might be in Dr Zhou’s clinic, just outside London.’
‘Has he got a clinic?’ said Will naively. ‘I thought he was just the church’s doctor?’
‘No, he’s a doctor on the outside, too,’ said Robin.
‘Lin doesn’t like him. She won’t like being in his clinic,’ muttered Will.
He glanced up at Robin and back at his own feet.
‘My father hired you, didn’t he?’
Strike and Robin looked at each other. The former, happy for Robin to take the lead, gave a slight shrug.
‘Yes,’ said Robin.
‘You can’t tell him I’m out,’ said Will, with a mixture of desperation and ferocity, looking up at Robin from beneath his eyebrows. ‘All right? If you’re going to tell my father, I’ll leave now. I only came here because I’ve got to find Lin, before I go to jail.’
‘Why d’you say you’re going to jail?’ asked Robin.
‘Because of all the things I’ve done. I don’t want to talk about it. As long as Lin and Qing are OK, I don’t mind, I deserve it. But you can’t tell my father. He’ll have to know once I’ve been arrested, but I won’t have to talk to him then, because I’ll be in custody. Anyway, once I start talking, the Drowned Prophet will probably come for me, so it won’t matter. But Lin’ll be able to get a council flat or something, won’t she? If she’s got a kid? Because I haven’t got any money,’ he added pathetically.
‘I’m sure something will be worked out,’ said Robin.
The glass door opened and Pat re-entered, carrying four boxes of pizza.
‘That was quick,’ said Strike.
‘It’s only up the road, isn’t it?’ said Pat, setting the pizzas down on the desk, ‘and I’ve just rung my granddaughter. She’s got clothes you can have, for the little one,’ she told Will. ‘Her youngest’s just turned three. She’ll bring them over.’
‘Hang on,’ said Strike, momentarily distracted. ‘You’re a—?’
‘Great-grandmother, yeah,’ said Pat, unemotionally. ‘We have ’em young in my family. Best way, when you’ve still got the energy.’
She hung up her bag and coat and went to fetch plates out of the kitchen area. Little Qing, who appeared to be having a fine time, now looked curiously towards the pizza boxes, from which an appetising smell was emanating, but Will’s lips had begun silently moving in what Robin recognised as the familiar chant, ‘Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu.’
‘I just need to have a quick word with Robin,’ Strike said to Will, disconcerted by his silent chanting. ‘You OK here with Pat for a bit?’
Will nodded, his lips still moving. Strike and Robin got up and, with a jerk of his head, Strike indicated to his partner that the landing would be the safest place to talk.
‘He and the kid should stay here,’ said Strike, having closed the glass door behind him. ‘They can have my place, and I’ll put up a camp bed in the office. I don’t think we can put them in a local hotel, it’s too close to Rupert Court, and I think he needs someone with him, in case he starts hallucinating the Drowned Prophet.’
‘OK,’ said Robin quietly, ‘but don’t tell him we’ve got to let Sir Colin know.’
‘Edensor’s the client. We’ve got to tell him.’
‘I know that,’ said Robin, ‘but Will doesn’t have to.’
‘Don’t you think, if we tell him his dad already knows about the kid—?’
‘I don’t think he’s scared of his father knowing about Qing. I think he’s worried Sir Colin will try and stop him going to prison.’
Strike looked down at her, nonplussed.
‘He’s obviously feeling really guilty about whatever he’s done in there, and prison’s just another Chapman Farm, isn’t it?’ said Robin. ‘Far less scary to him than the outside world.’
‘What are all these things, plural, he’s done, that are criminal?’ said Strike.
‘It might just be sleeping with Lin when she was underage,’ said Robin uncertainly. ‘I’m worried about pressing him for details, though, especially with Qing there. He might get upset, or kick off.’
‘You realise this is all down to you, him leaving?’
‘I don’t think so,’ said Robin. ‘It’s Lin disappearing that made him do it. He was already having doubts when I turned up.’
‘You pushed his doubts to breaking point. He’s probably left early enough for his daughter not to be completely screwed up, as well. I think you might’ve saved two lives.’
Robin looked up at him.
‘I know why you’re saying this, Stri—’
‘It’s the truth. This is the job, as well as the other thing.’
But Robin drew little comfort from his words. It would take more than the unexpected escape of Will Edensor to erase her mental image of Carrie’s two little girls crying for their mother.
They returned to the office. Both Will and Qing were devouring slices of pizza, Will ravenously, Qing looking as though she was experiencing nirvana.
‘So how did you do it, Will?’ Robin asked, sitting down again. ‘How did you get out?’
Will swallowed a large mouthful of pizza and said,
‘Stole twenty pounds from Mazu’s office. Went to the classroom when Shawna was in charge. Said Qing had to see Dr Zhou. Shawna believed me. Ran across the field. Climbed out at the blind spot, like you did. Flagged down a car. Woman took us to Norwich.’
Robin, who fully appreciated how difficult every single part of this plan would have been to execute, said,
‘That’s incredible. And then you hitched to London?’
‘Yeah,’ said Will.
‘But how on earth did you find our office?’
Will pushed the plastic bag at his feet towards Robin with his toe, rather than dislodge the child on his lap. Robin bent to pick it up and extracted the plastic rock.
‘Oh,’ she said. ‘It was you who moved it… but it was empty. There weren’t any letters in it.’
‘I know,’ said Will, his mouth full of pizza, ‘but I worked it out. After what – after the Retreat Room –’ he dropped his gaze to the floor again – ‘I sneaked out at night to see if there was anything on the edge of the woods, because Lin had seen you with the torch, and I thought you must be an investigator. I found the rock and looked inside, and there were imprints on the paper, from what you’d written on the sheets on top, so I could tell I was right, and you’d been writing about what was going on at Chapman Farm. After you left, Vivienne was telling everyone you’d answered to “Robin” in Norwich, and Taio said there was a big guy waiting for you at the blind spot when you escaped. So I looked up “Robin” and “detective” in a library in Norwich – got a lift to London – and—’
‘Bloody hell,’ said Strike, ‘we’ve been told you’re bright, but this is impressive.’
Will neither looked at Strike nor acknowledged his words, except by a slight frown. Robin suspected this was because Will knew it must have been Sir Colin who’d told the two detectives his son was clever.
‘Water,’ said Pat, as Qing began to cough, because she’d stuffed so much pizza into her mouth.
Robin joined Pat at the sink to help her fill glasses.
‘Could you distract Qing,’ Robin whispered to the office manager, the sound of running water drowning her voice, ‘while Strike and I talk to Will in our office? He might not want to talk openly in front of her.’
‘No problem,’ said Pat, in the growl that was her whisper. ‘Say the name again?’
‘Qing.’
‘Kind of name’s that?’
‘Chinese.’
‘Huh… mind you, my great-granddaughter’s called Tanisha. Sanskrit,’ said Pat, with a slight eye roll.
When Pat and Robin had handed out glasses of water, Pat said gruffly,
‘Qing, look at these.’
She’d taken a block of bright orange Post-it notes out of her desk.
‘They come off, look,’ said Pat. ‘And they stick to things.’
Fascinated, the little girl slid off Will’s lap, but still clung to his knee. Having seen the other children at Chapman Farm, Robin was glad of this sign that Qing knew her father was a place of safety.
‘You can play with them, if you want,’ said Pat.
The little girl toddled uncertainly towards Pat, who held out the block to her, and rummaged for some pens. Strike and Robin’s eyes met again, and Strike stood up, holding his pizza.
‘Fancy coming through here a moment, Will?’ he asked.
They left the connecting door between the offices open, so that Qing could see where her father was. Strike brought his plastic chair with him.
Robin had forgotten that all the pictures relating to the UHC case were on the board on the inner office wall. Will stopped dead, staring at them.
‘Why have you got all these?’ he said, in an accusatory voice, and to Robin’s dismay, he backed away. ‘That’s the Drowned Prophet,’ he said, pointing at the Torment Town pictures, sounding panicked now. ‘Why have you drawn her like that?’
‘We didn’t draw her,’ said Strike, moving quickly to close the flaps of the board, but Will said suddenly,
‘That’s Kevin!’
‘Yes,’ said Strike. Changing his mind about closing up the board, he stepped away from it, allowing Will a clear view. ‘Did you know Kevin?’
‘Only for a few… he left, not long after I… why…?’
Will took a few steps closer to the board. Kevin’s picture, which Strike had taken from the newspaper archive, still had the caption attached: ‘Murder of Kevin Pirbright was drug-related, say police.’
‘Kevin killed himself,’ said Will slowly. ‘Why’re they saying…?’
‘He was shot by someone else,’ said Strike.
‘No, he killed himself,’ said Will, with some of the dogmatism he’d displayed the first time Robin had ever heard him talk, on the vegetable patch. ‘He committed suicide, because he was pure spirit, and couldn’t cope with the materialist world.’
‘There was no gun found at the scene,’ said Strike. ‘Somebody else shot him.’
‘No… they can’t have done…’
‘They did,’ said Strike.
Will was frowning. Then –
‘Pig demons!’ he said suddenly, pointing at the Polaroids.
Strike and Robin looked at each other.
‘Kevin told me they appear, if there are too many impure spirits at the farm.’
‘Those aren’t demons,’ said Strike.
‘No,’ said Will, with a trace of impatience. ‘I know that. They’re wearing masks. But that’s how Kevin described them to me. Naked, with pig heads.’
‘Where did he see them, Will, did he say?’ asked Robin.
‘In the barn,’ said Will. ‘He and his sister saw them, through a gap in the wood. I don’t want her looking at me,’ he added in a febrile voice, and Robin, who knew he meant the Drowned Prophet, strode to the board and covered it over.
‘Why don’t you sit down?’ said Strike.
Will did so, but he looked very wary as the other two also sat. They could hear Qing chattering to Pat in the outer office.
‘Will, you said you’ve done things that are criminal,’ said Strike.
‘I’ll tell the police all about that, once we’ve found Lin.’
‘OK,’ said Strike, ‘but as we’re—’
‘I’m not talking about it,’ said Will, turning red again. ‘You’re not the police, you can’t make me.’
‘Nobody’s going to make you do anything,’ said Robin, with a warning look at her partner, whose demeanour, even when trying to be sympathetic, was often more threatening than he realised. ‘We only want what you want, Will: to find Lin and make sure Qing’s OK.’
‘You’re doing more than that,’ said Will, with a nervous jab of the finger towards the covered board. ‘You’re trying to take the UHC on, aren’t you? That won’t work. It won’t, it definitely won’t. You’re messing with stuff you don’t understand. I know, if I tell the police everything, she’ll come for me. That’s a chance I’ll have to take. I don’t care if I die, as long as Lin and Qing are OK.’
‘You’re talking about the Drowned Prophet?’ Robin asked.
‘Yeah,’ said Will. ‘You don’t want her after you, as well. She protects the church.’
‘We won’t need to take on the UHC now,’ lied Robin. ‘All that stuff on the board – we were just trying to find ways to put pressure on the Waces, so your family could see you.’
‘But I don’t want to see them!’
‘No, I know,’ said Robin. ‘I’m just saying, there’s no point us going on with that part of the investigation –’ she pointed at the board ‘– now you’re out.’
‘But you’ll find Lin?’
‘Yes, of course.’
‘What if she’s dead?’ Will burst out suddenly. ‘There was all that blood—’
‘I’m sure we’ll find her,’ said Robin.
‘It’ll be punishment on me, if she’s dead,’ said Will, ‘for what I did to my m-mum.’
He burst into tears.
Robin wheeled her chair out from behind the desk and drew nearer to Will, although she didn’t touch him. She guessed he’d seen his mother’s obituary online, in the internet café in Norwich. She said nothing, but waited for Will’s sobs to subside.
‘Will,’ she said, when at last she thought he was in a condition to take in what she was saying, ‘we’re only asking what you’ve done that might be criminal, because we need to know whether the church has got something on you that they could publish, before you’ve got a chance to talk to the police. If they do that, you could be arrested before we can find Lin, d’you see? And that would mean Qing being taken into care.’
Full of admiration for how Robin was handling this interview, Strike had to suppress a wholly inappropriate grin.
‘Oh,’ said Will, raising a grubby, tear-stained face. ‘Right. Well… they can’t publish it, without making themselves look really bad. It was either stuff we all had to do, or that I should’ve gone to the police about. They’re doing something really terrible in there. I didn’t realise how bad it was, ’til I had Qing.’
‘But you haven’t personally hurt anyone, have you?’
‘Yes, I have,’ he said miserably. ‘Lin. And – I’ll tell the police all of it, not you. Once we’ve got Lin, I’ll tell the police.’
Pat’s mobile rang and they heard her say,
‘Stay on the corner, I’ll come and get ’em off you.’ She appeared in the doorway. ‘Someone’ll have to look after Qing. That’s Kayleigh, with the clothes for her.’
‘That was—’ began Strike, but before he could say ‘quick’ for the second time that morning, Pat had disappeared. Qing now tottered into the inner office, in search of her father, demanding to go to the bathroom. By the time Will and Qing had returned from the landing, Pat had reappeared holding two bulging bags of second-hand children’s clothes, looking cross.
‘Bloody nosy, the lot of ’em,’ she complained, setting the bags on her desk.
‘Who?’ asked Robin, as Pat took out a small pair of dungarees, got awkwardly down on her knees and sized them up against a fascinated Qing.
‘My family,’ said Pat. ‘Always trying to find out what sort of office I work in. That was my granddaughter. Met her on the corner. No need for her to know what we do.’
‘You haven’t told any of them you work here?’
‘Signed an NDA, didn’t I?’
‘How did Kayleigh—?’
‘Her boyfriend brought ’em into town. She works up the road in TK Maxx. Told her it was urgent. Right, missus,’ she told Qing, ‘let’s get you into this clean stuff. You wanna do it,’ she asked Will, squinting up at him, ‘or shall I?’
‘I can do it,’ said Will, taking the dungarees, though looking slightly at a loss as to how they worked.
‘Robin can help you,’ said Pat. ‘Can I have a word?’ she added to Strike.
‘Can’t it—?’
‘No,’ she said.
So Strike followed Pat back into the room they’d just left, and Pat closed the door on Will, Qing and Robin.
‘Where’re they gonna stay?’ Pat demanded of Strike.
‘Here,’ said Strike, ‘I’ve just worked that out with Robin. They can go upstairs.’
‘That’s no good. They want looking after. They should come and stay with me.’
‘We can’t impose—’
‘It’s not imposing, I’m offering. We’ve got room, my Dennis won’t mind, and Dennis can be with them, while I’m at work. There’s a garden for the little girl and I can get her some toys off my granddaughters. They want looking after,’ repeated Pat, with a gimlet look that told Strike she didn’t consider him qualified for the job. ‘There’s no harm in that boy,’ said Pat, as though Strike had been arguing the contrary. ‘Just did a bloody silly thing. I’ll take care of them, ’til he’s ready to see his dad.’
