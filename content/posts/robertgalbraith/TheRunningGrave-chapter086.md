The Running Grave
86
Six in the fourth place means:
Waiting in blood.
Get out of the pit.
The I Ching or Book of Changes
Robin had been sitting with Jacob all day. He had, indeed, had a fit: she’d tried to stop him hurting himself against the cot bars, and finally he’d grown limp and she’d laid him gently back down. She’d changed his nappy three times, putting the soiled ones into the black bin bag sitting there for that purpose, and tried to give him water, but he seemed unable to swallow.
At midday she’d been brought food by one of the teenage girls who’d stood vigil outside the temple four nights previously. The girl said nothing to her, and kept her eyes averted from Jacob. Barring this one interruption, Robin was left entirely alone. She could hear people moving around in the farmhouse below, and knew she was only allowed this solitude because it would be impossible for her to creep back down the farmhouse stairs without being apprehended. Her fatigue kept threatening to overwhelm her; several times, she nodded off in the hard wooden chair and jerked awake as she slid sideways.
As the hours wore on, she took to reading pages of the newspaper spread over the floor in an attempt to stay awake. Thus she learned that the Prime Minister, David Cameron, had resigned after the country had voted to leave the EU, that Theresa May had now taken his place and that that Chilcot Inquiry had found that the UK had entered the Iraq War before peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted.
The information Robin had been denied for so long, information unfiltered by Jonathan Wace’s interpretation, had a peculiar effect on her. It felt as though it came from a different galaxy, making her feel her isolation even more acutely, yet at the same time, it pulled her mentally back towards the outer world, the place where nobody knew what ‘flesh objects’ were, or dictated what you wore and ate, or attempted to regulate the language in which you thought and spoke.
Now two contradictory impulses battled inside her. The first was allied to her exhaustion; it urged caution and compliance and urged her to chant to drive everything else from her mind. It recalled the dreadful hours in the box and whispered that the Waces were capable of worse than that, if she broke any more rules. But the second asked her how she could return to her daily tasks knowing that a small boy was being slowly starved to death behind the farmhouse walls. It reminded her that she’d managed to slip out of the dormitory by night many times without being caught. It urged her to take the risk one more time, and escape.
She was brought a second bowl of noodles and a glass of water at dinner time, this time by a boy who also kept his gaze carefully averted from Jacob and looked repulsed by the smell in the room, to which Robin had become acclimatised.
Dusk arrived, and Robin had now read almost all of the newspapers lying on the floor. Not wanting to put on the electric light in case it disturbed the child in the cot, she got up and moved to the small dormer window to continue reading an article about Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Having finished this, she turned the page over and saw the headline SOCIALITE DIED IN BATH, INQUEST TOLD, before realising that the picture below was of Charlotte Ross.
Robin’s gasp was so loud Jacob stirred in his sleep. With one hand pressed over her mouth, Robin read the article, the paper held inches from her eyes in the dying light. She’d just read how much alcohol and how many sleeping pills Charlotte had taken before slitting her wrists in the bath, when there was a soft knock on the attic door.
Robin threw the report about Charlotte back onto the floor and hastened back to her chair as the door opened to reveal Emily, whose head, like her mother’s, was freshly shaven.
Emily closed the door quietly. From what Robin could see of her through the rapidly darkening room, she looked apprehensive, almost tearful.
‘Rowena – I’m so sorry, I’m really, really sorry.’
‘What about?’
‘I told them you gave me money in Norwich. I didn’t want to, but they were threatening me with the box.’
‘Oh, that… it’s OK, I admitted it, too. It was stupid to expect them not to notice.’
‘You can go. Jiang’s waiting downstairs to escort you to the dormitory.’
Robin stood up and had taken a couple of steps towards the door when something strange happened.
She suddenly knew – didn’t guess, or hope, but knew – that Strike had just arrived beside the blind spot at the perimeter fence. The conviction was so strong that it stopped her in her tracks. Then she turned slowly to face Emily again.
‘Who are Jacob’s parents?’
‘I don’t – we don’t… you shouldn’t ask stuff like that.’
‘Tell me,’ said Robin.
Robin could just make out the whites of Emily’s eyes by the fading light from the window. After a few seconds Emily whispered,
‘Louise and Jiang.’
‘Lou—seriously?’
‘Yeah… Jiang isn’t allowed to go with the younger women. He’s an NIM.’
‘What does that mean?’
‘Non-Increasing Male. Some of the men aren’t allowed to go with fertile women. I don’t think anyone thought Louise could still get pregnant, but… then Jacob came.’
‘What did you mean, when you told me Daiyu did forbidden things at the farm?’
‘Nothing,’ whispered Emily, now sounding panicky. ‘Forget I—’
‘Listen,’ said Robin (she knew Strike was there, she was certain of it), ‘you owe me.’
After a couple of seconds’ silence, Emily whispered,
‘Daiyu used to sneak off instead of doing lessons, that’s all.’
‘What was she doing, when she sneaked off?’
‘She went into the woods, and into barns. I asked her and she said she was doing magic with other people who were pure spirit. Sometimes she had sweets and little toys. She wouldn’t tell us where she’d got them, but she’d show us. She wasn’t what they say she was. She was spoiled. Mean. Becca saw it all, too. She pretends she didn’t—’
‘Why did you tell me Daiyu didn’t drown?’
‘I can’t—’
‘Tell me.’
‘You’ve got to go,’ whispered Emily frantically. ‘Jiang’s waiting for you.’
‘Then talk quickly,’ said Robin. ‘What made you say Daiyu didn’t drown?’
‘Because… it was just… Daiyu told me she was going to go away with this older girl and live with her.’ Emily’s voice was full of a strange longing.
‘D’you mean Cherie Gittins?’
‘How—?’
‘Was it Cherie?’
‘Yes… I was so jealous. We all really loved Cherie, she was like… like a real… like what they’d call a mother.’
‘Where does invisibility come in?’
‘How did you—?’
‘Tell me.’
‘It was the night before they went to the beach. Cherie gave us all special drinks, but I didn’t like the taste. I poured mine down the sink. When everyone else was asleep, I saw Cherie helping Daiyu out of the dormitory window. I knew she didn’t want anyone to see what she’d done, so I pretended to be asleep, and she went back to bed.’
‘She pushed Daiyu out of the window and then went back to bed herself?’
‘Yes, but she’ll just have been helping Daiyu do whatever she wanted to do. Daiyu could get people in trouble with Papa J and Mazu, if they didn’t do what she wanted.’
From downstairs came a shout:
‘Rowena?’
‘I’m in the bathroom,’ Robin shouted. Turning back to Emily, whom she could no longer see in the dark, she said,
‘Quickly – did you ever tell Kevin what you saw? Tell me, please.’
‘Yes,’ said Emily. ‘Later. Ages later. When I told Becca I’d seen Cherie helping Daiyu out of the window, she said, “You didn’t see that, you can’t have done. If you couldn’t see Daiyu in her bed, it was because she can turn invisible.” Becca loved Cherie too. Becca would’ve done anything for her. When Cherie left, I cried for days. It was like losing – oh God,’ said Emily, panicked.
Footsteps were coming along the corridor. The door opened and the light was slapped on. Jiang stood revealed in the doorway, wearing a blue tracksuit. Jacob’s eyes opened and he began to whimper. Scowling, Jiang averted his gaze from his son.
‘Sorry,’ Robin said to Jiang. ‘I needed the loo and then I had to tell Emily when I last gave him a drink and changed his—’
‘I don’t need the details,’ snapped Jiang. ‘Come on.’
