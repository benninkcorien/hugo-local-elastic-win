Chapter 4
CHAPTER FOUR
Detective Ridley Calvin was too big for his office. Austin was above average height, but Ridley had at least four inches on him, with broad shoulders and a neck as thick as one of Austin’s thighs. When Austin entered, Ridley was scrunched behind a desk that looked like doll furniture as he stood and extended a meaty hand. His grip was like a vise.
“I take it you work out,” Austin said, taking the seat that was offered.
“Relieves the stress. Keeps me looking younger than I feel.”
“Good to meet you, Detective.”
“Call me Rid,” he said, wedging his legs back under the desk.
“Actually, call him Black Sherlock.” It was a woman’s voice from the hall.
Austin turned to see a young woman, her freckled complexion as pale white as Ridley’s was a rich, onyx black. She stood in the doorway, grinning.
“Austin, this is Lucy O’Rourke, deputy detective, aka Lucy O’Licorice, aka Lucy O’Law-and-Order, aka Lucy O’Lager, aka Lucy O’Lexus, aka—”
“Hey, I don’t drive a Lexus.”
“And I don’t go by Black Sherlock.”
Lucy strolled into the office, leaned on Ridley’s desk, and addressed Austin as though they were old friends. “One time he texted me—he meant to text his wife but her name is Luanne so I guess she’s right next to me in his contacts or whatever—and he texted me instead. Nothing too inappropriate, thankfully, but he signed the text, Black Sherlock.” She paused. “In this office, he will never be known by another name. Not only did he refer to himself by a nickname to his wife, but who signs their texts?”
Lucy looked to be about ten years younger than Austin, probably early thirties, while Ridley’s beard—neatly trimmed but graying—made him look about ten years older.
Lucy extended a hand. “I’ll answer to any of those other names, or any you make up. As long as they refer to things I like. I’m especially fond of Lucy O’Lemonade and Lucy O’Latte. Pretty much anything I can drink. And don’t let this man tell you he’s not Black Sherlock. He earned that gray in his beard.” Her phone buzzed and she glanced at the caller-ID, then headed out, pausing in the doorway. “Welcome to Kitsap, NYPD Austin.”
Ridley waved her out and she closed the door behind her. “She’s a ball of energy,” he said. “Remember being thirty?”
Austin smiled. “Don’t feel too bad. I only recently stopped signing my texts. The cook at my café is five years younger than Lucy and he speaks an entirely different language. He installed Wi-Fi at my place and the way he talked about how it worked, he may as well have been reciting ancient spells or something.”
Ridley laughed. “The generational divide seems to be widening at lightning speed.”
“Fine by me. I was always about ten years behind my age group when it came to computers and phones and all that. I’m perfectly content fossilizing out in Hansville all on my own.”
Ridley eyed him skeptically. “You were one of the youngest detectives in the NYPD, and, from what I hear, one of the best. You’re what, forty?”
“Forty-three.”
“Hard to believe you’ll be happy selling salmon bait for the rest of your life.”
Austin’s jaw clenched. “I will be.” His tone was a little more forceful than he’d intended, like he was trying hard to convince Ridley. Or maybe he was trying to convince himself.
The silence that followed was awkward, Ridley fiddled with a stack of papers on his desk. Finally, he let out a long breath. “So.”
“So,” Austin agreed.
“No good way to make this transition, so I’ll just go for it: The Holiday Baby Butcher.”
Austin grimaced. “Listen, I lived with the New York tabloids making money off her nickname and, well…let’s just call her by her name, okay?”
“Gotcha,” Ridley said. “Makes sense. Can you tell me what you know of her?”
Austin sighed. “Where should I start? How much of the files have you read?”
“All I could get so far, but still waiting on some pieces from your neck of the woods, and the FBI is—well—slow to share their work.”
Austin chuckled. “You don’t say?”
Ridley smiled, but quickly moved on. He slid a picture across the desk. It was a beautiful baby, cradled in the deeply-tanned arms of someone, likely the mother since Austin could make out the sleeve of a hospital gown. “Allie Shreever. That’s when she was one day old. The next day, she was home with her parents in Bremerton. Nineteen days later, sometime between one and five in the morning, she was taken out of her crib. No footprints, no fingerprints, no forensic evidence, no security footage, no witnesses. Roughly three days later, she was murdered. Couple days after that, the bag of bones I texted you was found on the beach. Coincidentally, only a mile from your place.”
Austin exhaled slowly, trying to keep his cool as he slid the photo back across the table. His jaw had tightened during Ridley’s summary, his back teeth grinding. It sounded exactly like every murder Lorraine D’Antonia had ever committed.
“So,” Ridley continued, “I want to get your take on what we have, but first, what’s your read on her? D’Antonia, I mean.”
“Why? She’s in prison for life. You’ve clearly got a copycat here so—”
“I get it,” Ridley said, “and no one is questioning whether you got the right woman. I’ve been through this with the folks in Seattle. Everyone knows you got the right woman. That’s why they prosecuted. Why she confessed. My thinking is, assuming we have a copycat, he or she is a damn good one. Maybe you can give me something that’s not in the files, something in the way D’Antonia thinks or does things that a copycat might use.” Ridley stood and walked a slow lap around his desk, looking like a giant lion trapped in a small cage. “I’ve been on this case for three weeks and, other than a couple stoners who saw a woman drop the bones on the beach, I’ve got nothing. I’m looking for any help I can get.”
Austin liked this guy. On TV, detectives often came off as brilliant loners single-handedly bringing down evil. In practice, catching killers was much more of a team sport, even for the most brilliant detectives out there.
“Short version?” Austin asked.
Ridley nodded.
“Lorraine D’Antonia was a registered nurse. Worked labor and delivery. But she didn’t target babies born in the hospitals where she worked except for the New York kidnapping of Sonya Lopez. She targeted two-parent heterosexual couples, couples with happy, loving marriages, stable family lives. Not the most vulnerable, which is interesting because it spoke to motive. She was viciously jealous of these infants—as deranged as that sounds. She did confess to loitering in hospitals, following parents home, that kind of thing. Each time it was a kidnapping in the dead of night, no fingerprints or DNA, no direct surveillance. And you know what she did after she took the children.”
Ridley tugged gently on his beard, deep in thought. “The psych profile the FBI put together, that match your read on her?”
Austin nodded. “She told a story of being adopted and missing her birth mother, but D’Antonia actually had it pretty good. FBI says sociopathy and psychopathy. Add a couple other brands of crazy, and you have Lorraine D’Antonia.” Austin winced internally, remembering some of the details of the case. “She always took the babies a few days before the holidays, dressed them up in cute little outfits, and played mommy for a few days. Treated them incredibly well, like little princes and princesses. Presents related to the holidays—easter baskets and whatnot—fed them formula, took photos with them, then…”
Austin trailed off, but Ridley finished his thought. “Then drugged them and boiled the bodies until the flesh sloughed off the bones. Stashed the bones in holiday bags and dropped them places where they’d be found. Written about. Cause a panic in parents everywhere.”
“Exactly. Some people thought the process she went through—the kidnapping, pampering, then murdering—fulfilled some deep, nagging pain in her. For whatever that’s worth. Me? I don’t claim to know why, but I know she’s one of the most evil people to ever live.”
Ridley scooched his chair back and crossed one leg over the other. “I’ve read the case files. Anything major that didn’t make it to the trial?”
“The poems. Never came out at trial or in the press—she carved holiday poems into the bones of her victims. Used a Dremel tool.”
Ridley nodded. “The poems. In a case as sickening as any I’ve ever seen, that detail takes it to a new level.”
They both shook their heads, sitting in silence as that fact filled the room. Faced with a case this disgusting, this disturbing, there was often nothing to say.
Finally, Ridley said, “We’ve got a little budget for expert consultants. Any chance you’d—”
Austin held up both hands as if to say, Whoa, hold up.
“Hear me out,” Ridley said. “Lucy is gonna be working a few leads on this, and I’m hoping you’ll agree to work alongside her, just for a week or two in a very limited consulting role. You know the case and the files better than anyone. And Lucy is more street smart than book smart. I can hardly get her to read the files. I—”
“I don’t want any part of this.”
“None of us want any part of this. I’d rather be home helping my son study for the SATs, or teaching my daughter how to drive. I’d rather be eating a shit sandwich sprinkled with tacks, for God’s sake. But here I am.” Ridley implored Austin with a look. “Tell you what. Last week I went to the prison, did a twenty-minute interview with The Holiday Baby Bu-, with D’Antonia. Watch it, and if you can walk out of here afterwards, I’ll let you go and you won’t hear from me again.”
Austin said nothing.
“Watch the video,” Ridley said. “She mentions you by name.”
Austin was hit with a ping of curiosity accompanied by the flavor of tart cherries, the taste he always got at the beginning of a case. Then he got another ping, a thought about something Ridley had said. “Wait, when I mentioned the poems, you said, ‘That detail takes it to a new level.’ Present tense.”
He leveled his eyes on Ridley, who uncrossed his legs and offered another one of those sighs that Austin knew well. “We’ll get to that.”
