Chapter 21
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
Detective Calvin pounded the door like it had insulted his sister. “Kitsap Sheriff’s Office, open up please.” The way he spoke, even the “please” sounded like a direct order one ignored at his own peril.
The dasher had given them an address only ten minutes away, a two-story apartment complex that looked like it had once been a motel. External staircases led to outdoor walkways that ran the length of the building, with five or six apartments on each floor. From the doorway, Austin could see down into the parking lot, where Samantha waited in the car.
When there was no answer, Lucy gave the door a pound as well. “Detective Lucy O’Rourke, open up. Now.” She didn’t bother with the “please.”
A series of odd noises came from inside the apartment: a muffled clang, a shifting and swishing, a dull thud. When the door swung open Austin was struck by the sickening stench of cat urine. But not just any cat urine. It was the kind that had sat for days, possibly weeks, developing into a sick ammonia smell that caused all three of them to step back a pace into the fresher air of the walkway.
The man, dressed in white boxers, a stained t-shirt and a half-open robe tied loosely around his waist, didn’t look surprised to see them. “May I help you?” He held a foil-wrapped burrito out in front of him as though offering it up for his guests.
“I’m Detective Calvin. We’re looking for Trisha Simone.”
“Who?” When he took a huge bite of the burrito, a few grains of rice escaped onto the carpet.
“We know you know her,” Ridley said. “I’ll give you one shot to tell the truth before your day goes from bad to worse.”
“Never heard of no Trisha.” As he spoke, flecks of chicken and tortilla sprayed out through the doorway, landing at their feet. Austin thought he was going to be sick.
When he’d finished chewing, he eyed the burrito as though choosing the perfect bite, then lowered it to his side. “Why do you think I know a Trisha?”
Lucy stepped toward him, swatting the burrito onto the ground. “Detective Calvin asks the questions. You answer them.”
“Hey, that cost ten bucks plus tip.”
Austin could see Lucy’s fists clenched by her side, her knuckles turning white.
“Where is she?” Ridley demanded.
“Dunno.”
Ridley stayed composed. “You don’t know her, or you do know her but don’t know where she is?”
“I ain’t got nothing to do with whatever she has going on.”
Ridley leaned in. “So you do know her?”
He nodded.
“And what does she have going on?”
“Weed, I guess. I mean, right? That’s why you’re here, right?”
That was quick. Ridley had broken him in under two minutes.
“And what else?” Ridley asked.
“Else?”
Ridley stepped a little closer. “An order was placed on her DoorDash account with this address.”
He swallowed. “Don’t mean I know where she is.”
“Does she live here?”
“No.”
“What’s your name?”
“Frank Baxter.”
Ridley whipped out a notebook and jotted down the name. “Why are you using her account, Frank Baxter?”
“She in some kind of trouble?”
Austin’s read on this guy was that he was clueless, likely a deadbeat, but he doubted Frank Baxter had the inclination—or the intelligence—to pull off two kidnappings without leaving a trace. After all, he couldn’t even eat a burrito without leaving DNA evidence all over the place. If Trisha was behind the kidnappings, he was pretty sure Frank Baxter wasn’t an accomplice.
Austin caught Ridley’s eye, asking with a look whether he could take over. Ridley nodded. “Mr. Baxter, right now, you’re not in any trouble. Trisha sells weed without a dispensary license. We know that. Maybe you’re part of that, maybe you’re not. Here in Washington State, that might get her—what?—a month or so in jail, maybe a year on probation. I honestly don’t give a damn if she rolls up a joint the size of the Empire State Building and smokes it on the beach with every single person of legal age in the state of Washington. Right now we’re trying to find a missing baby.” He stepped forward, eyes hard, mouth and nose unbreathing. “Tell us everything about her, now, or we’ll haul your filthy ass in as an accomplice to kidnapping and murder.”
Austin held his gaze. Frank Baxter’s eyes were light blue, wet, and a little bloodshot. This wasn’t the first time he’d been under police scrutiny, Austin thought. When Baxter’s gaze dropped to his burrito, which was scattered all over the carpet—Austin stepped back.
Baxter closed one eye and cocked his head to the side, like he was trying to focus hard enough to tell the truth. “Trish and I bang sometimes.” He said it casually, shooting a lewd look at Lucy like he wanted to see her reaction. “It’s not serious, but… well, like I said, we bang sometimes. Met her on an app.”
“Why are you using her DoorDash account?” Austin asked.
“She put the info into my computer last time she was here. Or maybe the time before. Phone was dead or some shit. Anyway, we bang, then we order food and watch Netflix. Just like the kids say, Netflix and chill, right?”
“Where is she?” Ridley demanded.
He shrugged. “I swear, I dunno.” He picked up what was left of his burrito, a limp tortilla with bits of rice, beans, and chicken clinging to it for dear life. Inspecting it for carpet fuzz and dirt, he said, “I’m gonna report this, get the county to buy me a new burrito.”
“When you meet up to have sex,” Ridley said, “who usually initiates it? Does she text you first, does she just show up? How does it work?”
“Different ways. Usually she texts. Couple times she’s just showed up when she needs the secret sauce, ya know?” He winked at Ridley, who grimaced.
“You’re a pig,” Lucy stated, matter-of-factly.
He shrugged. “She’s the one making the booty calls.”
Austin asked, “If she was in trouble, would she come here? If not, where would she go? Think hard.”
“I know she works over in Seattle sometimes, Task-something. But she doesn’t stay there unless she’s got another booty call over there I don’t know about.”
“What else?” Austin asked.
“I don’t think she’d come here. Like I said, we’re not real close. Other than the secret sauce, I don’t give her nothin’. Other than the honeydew pudding, she don’t give me nothing.”
The urine smell was somehow intensifying, mingling with the spices and chicken from the burrito, creating a new smell unlike anything Austin had ever experienced. He stepped back and leaned over the railing, his stomach turning like he was going to vomit.
He saw a woman. Thin, with dirty blond hair. She was walking across the parking lot, carrying a plastic shopping bag. “Ridley, Lucy.” They turned and he pointed. “That’s her.”
Ridley said, “Lucy, take the staircase on the left. I’ll take the right. Austin, stay here and keep an eye on this guy.”
Trisha still hadn’t looked up. Lucy and Ridley took off, leaping down the stairs two and three at a time. When they reached the lot, they were only thirty yards from Trisha. She had no chance.
“Trisha!” Baxter screamed. “Ruuuuuuunnnnnn!”
She glanced up and saw Austin. For half a second, she seemed to inspect him, trying to place him. Then she pivoted, saw Ridley coming for her, and bolted back in the direction she’d come from.
Austin turned back to the doorway. Frank Baxter was gone. He poked his head into the apartment, holding his breath.
The last thing he saw was a brown clay pot coming for his head.
