Chapter 12
CHAPTER TWELVE
Austin cracked the window as they took the long hill down toward the water. The drizzle had died down, the sun creeping out from behind the clouds as they passed into Hansville. This was not uncommon as one drove north from Kingston into the tiny town at the end of the peninsula. When he’d moved to the area, Austin had learned that Hansville lay in a rain shadow—some called it a sun belt. Hansville received twenty-five percent less rain per year than the closest neighboring town only five miles to the south. In an area known for its rain, that twenty-five percent made a big difference.
After leaving Joshua Green’s parents, Austin had huddled with Lucy and Ridley on the lawn, out of earshot of the reporters. While the peacock wandered around at their feet, they’d decided that Ridley would go to the birthing center at St. Michael’s—the only known connection between the two victims—leaving Lucy and Austin to re-interview the teenagers who’d found Allie Shreever’s bones on the beach at Point No Point.
Lucy’s phone rang as they turned onto Point No Point Road, a one-mile stretch that led out to the famous lighthouse. “It’s Jimmy,” she said, tapping the touchscreen on the dashboard.
Jimmy’s excited voice filled the car in choppy bursts. “Photos of… car that passed… Hansville road. 10… and… AM. In… inbox. Got plates on… few with… and add… Others… blurry, but I marked the type of car.”
“Reception sucks out here,” Lucy called loudly into her steering wheel. “But nice work, J-Cool. Anything leap out at you?”
“Only… dozen or so.”
“You’ve got—”
“People heading to the addresses?” Jimmy’s voice was clearer now. They’d hit a good patch of reception as they neared the beach. “Yeah. On it. Just got off the phone with Sherlock and he’s got everyone he can on this.”
“Thanks,” Lucy said, “I’ll take a look.” She hung up as Austin spotted a pair he assumed were the witnesses. Teenagers, holding hands on a bench facing the water, both glancing around nervously. “That them?”
“Yup, this’ll be my third interview with them. Pissed as hell they told Anna about the bones. They promised they wouldn’t talk to anyone about it. When we made the announcement that Allie Shreever had been found deceased, we wanted to make sure the exact nature of her death was kept quiet, for now.”
Austin shrugged. “I’m surprised they waited so long to blab about it. Most teenagers I’ve met would’ve had it up on Instachat before calling the police.”
Lucy raised an eyebrow. “Instachat?”
“Snapgram, I meant.”
Lucy laughed. “How old are you?”
He shrugged. “Do I not have it right?”
“It’s Instagram and Snapchat.”
“Are you sure?”
Lucy laughed again, then nodded at the teenagers, who’d started walking toward them.
“Their story been consistent the whole time?” Austin asked.
“Mostly. First time they left out that they were at the beach to smoke weed, but they’ve been forthcoming otherwise. We looked into them just in case, but they’re basically good kids.”
They met in the corner of the parking lot by the bathrooms. After chiding Sarah and Benny for talking to a reporter, Lucy introduced Austin as a “consultant helping out with the case.”
When they were through with introductions, Austin said, “How about you walk me through it. Slowly. Exactly what you saw, heard, noticed, felt. Also, I want to know whether anything was different that day than the other times you’ve come here?”
“Got it,” Benny said, flippantly. He seemed distracted, uninterested.
Austin waited until Benny met his eyes. “If a grain of sand was in a different spot than usual, I want to know about it.”
Benny chuckled.
Sarah said, “Like, literally? Seriously?”
Austin offered her a tight smile. “Seriously, but not literally.”
Benny led them down the beach, doing most of the talking. Since he’d already admitted to the other detectives they were there to smoke, he included that in his story from the beginning. From the beach they followed the trail up to the bench on the bluff.
When Benny reached the part about the woman appearing, Austin stopped him. “At what point were you aware she was carrying something?”
“Right away. I mean, I thought it was an umbrella.”
“Was this before or after you started smoking?”
“Before,” Benny said, looking at the ground. “I lit up after she left. And I know I’m underage, but c’mon.”
“I didn’t smoke anything,” Sarah interjected. She was dressed in a dark blue dress with black leggings, the kind of outfit you’d expect to see at a chorus recital. It contrasted with Benny’s greasy jeans and black hoodie.
“You two a couple?” Austin asked.
Benny said “yes” and Sarah said “no,” then they both laughed and shook their heads.
“It’s complicated,” Sarah said, in a tone that communicated she didn’t want to say anything more.
Austin pointed at the beach. “So she comes down the beach, leaves the bag, and how long was she there afterwards?”
“Maybe thirty seconds,” Sarah said. “Snapped a few photos.”
Like the size eight shoe, this was another similarity to the D’Antonia case. It had come out in the trial that Lorraine D’Antonia had also taken photos of her bags of bones. Beloved memories, she’d called them to Austin’s disgust. “Was the woman facing the water when she took the photos? Or did she walk around the log so her back was to the water?”
Sarah thought. “She was facing the water, I think, um…”
“She was,” Benny agreed.
“And did she take a long time composing the photos, or was it quick?”
“Quick,” Sarah said.
Austin pointed across the water to the east. “And the sun was up, but not high in the sky, correct? 11 AM?”
“Right,” Sarah said. “It was cloudy, drizzly, but still a glare coming through.” She pointed east, across the water. “You know how it gets where it’s raining but there’s still a glare.”
Austin knew. On the east coast, he’d grown used to clouds and sunshine, storms and clear skies, snow and heat, but here there were endless shades of gray depending on how thick the cloud cover was.
D’Antonia’s photos had been well-composed, almost professional, then edited on her phone to look dramatic and moody. The woman who’d left the bones here seemed to have been in a hurry, like she didn’t really care how the photos looked. If she’d cared, she would have stood with her back to the sun. The way she took the photos, facing the source of the light, would have made the bag look unnaturally dark.
Lucy asked, “Where are you going with this?”
He shook her off, not wanting to explain in front of Sarah and Benny. “Sarah, tell me about the noise you heard.”
“I thought it was a gunshot,” she said.
Benny shook his head. “Sounded like a car backfiring.”
Lucy pulled her phone from her back pocket and opened the email from Jimmy. “Any of these cars look familiar to you? They were caught on a surveillance camera around the time you saw the woman.”
Austin looked over their shoulders as they scanned through the document. Each car had its own page, some with license plate numbers, names, and addresses, others just photographs. All the photographs were from an odd angle, all were fairly blurry, but the general shape, size, and colors of the vehicles were clear.
“I didn’t see a car pull in or out,” Jimmy said.
“Me neither,” Sarah added. “And I know nothing about cars.”
“But maybe you’ve seen them around town,” Austin said, “or maybe you saw a car when you were on the bluff?”
“Sorry,” Sarah said.
“According to Detective O’Rourke here,” Austin said, taking the phone, “you heard a car pass soon after the loud sound. Is that right?”
They both nodded.
“How many seconds after you heard the sound?”
“Why does that matter?” Benny asked.
Austin gave him a hard stare.
“Okay, okay. It was like a minute.”
“Wasn’t that long. Like literally ten or twenty seconds after,” Sarah said. “Maybe less, it was like right away almost.”
Given that Benny had been high, he was going to trust Sarah’s sense of time.
Austin scanned the document. A black BMW, registered on Bainbridge Island. A red Toyota Corolla, no plate visible. A green and brown Chevy truck, registered to a woman in Kingston. He stopped on that one. It was an older make, 1980. The rest of the cars were newer, and he scrolled back to the truck. “You sure you didn’t see this truck?”
Newer cars were less likely to backfire unless the owners customized them to do so. He doubted a woman in her fifties or sixties would do that. Older cars in need of tune-ups were more likely to backfire in general, and specifically when they were in motion, rather than on the start. “Is it possible,” he asked, “That the woman parked this truck, walked down the beach, left the bag of bones, returned to her truck, pulled out of the driveway, causing the truck to backfire, then sped past you up the road out of town?”
“Sure,” Sarah said. “But I didn’t see that truck.”
“Same,” Benny added.
Lucy was following Austin’s train of thought. Tapping and swiping furiously on her phone, she said, “Give us a sec,” to the teenagers.
They were happy to walk down the trail toward the beach.
Before Austin could ask what she was doing, Lucy held up her phone. It was open to Facebook and displayed a picture of a woman who appeared to be in her late-fifties. She had dirty blonde hair and a bony, well-worn face. She looked vaguely like the poorly-rendered sketch on the wall at the Sheriff’s office. She also looked a little like Lorraine D’Antonia—around the same age, with the same hair color and skinny, angular face.
“Trisha Simone,” Lucy said. “Kingston. Registered owner of the truck.”
She jogged toward the teenagers, who’d only made it thirty yards down the path. “Could this be the woman you saw?”
They said “Yes” in unison.
A smile broke out across Lucy’s face. “Keep your phones on. Both of you.” Then she turned to Austin. “Let’s go.”
