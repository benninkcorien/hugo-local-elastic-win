Chapter 23
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Two hours later, Austin sat on the floor in the corner of the conference room, tossing a balled-up piece of paper for Itsy. She was well-trained; she knew her name, knew how to sit, and had ceased the high-pitched yelping. All in all, she was a lovely dog once she’d had the chance to calm down.
Itsy dropped the slobbery paper by his feet. He balled it up tighter and threw it to the other side of the room. Itsy ran to fetch it, still limping, then lay down in the corner to gnaw it to shreds.
Ridley was taking a statement from Baxter, who’d declined a lawyer and was being forthcoming, though he still claimed to know nothing beyond Trisha’s low-level dealing. Baxter had turned over his cellphone, showing a long record of texts with Trisha indicating that he’d likely been telling the truth—booty calls, burritos, and Netflix. The occasional raunchy photo. Nothing to indicate he was involved in her dealing, or that he knew anything about the kidnappings.
Trisha was a different story, and Austin couldn’t stop thinking about the interview. She’d obviously been lying. The question was, was she lying about everything?
What he couldn’t understand was why she’d gone to Frank Baxter’s in the first place. If she had Joshua stashed somewhere, she would have returned to him the moment she fled from her apartment. She would have wanted to move him on the assumption that, if police had found her apartment, they’d soon find her stash house. It was possible she’d gone to try to borrow Baxter’s phone, or borrow money. But she’d had $900 in cash on her when they’d arrested her. So why hadn’t Trisha hopped a cab back to wherever Joshua was stashed after she’d disappeared into the park? It had only been a few hours between the time she’d ditched Austin in Kingston and the time she’d arrived at Baxter’s. So if she had gone to move Joshua, she’d been quick about it, which meant she had another place nearby.
Another issue nagged at him. Austin knew Lorraine D’Antonia better than any other law enforcement officer in the country. She wasn’t a jilted lover who got enraged and shot her ex. She wasn’t even an overwhelmed mother who’d drowned her children in a lake. He’d arrested women like that before and, as horrible as they were, Lorraine D’Antonia was in a different category altogether. She’d taken children from their homes, played holiday dress up with them for three days, then administered lethal doses of poison. Afterwards, she’d boiled the flesh off their bones, then Dremeled cheesy poetry onto them. She was a psychopath on a level all her own. As much as he wanted to believe they had their woman, he simply didn’t think Trisha Simone capable of that sort of inhuman behavior. Like Frank Baxter, she came across as a down-on-her-luck sad sack. A low-level criminal lacking both the intelligence and the psychopathy to pull off elaborate kidnappings and murders. And if she wasn’t behind the kidnappings, why did she keep lying?
Itsy returned, offering up a moist scrap of paper, then curling up by his feet. He missed Run. He’d called Andy to make sure he’d be in early to feed her and toss the ball around, but he felt guilty for leaving her. He told himself he’d take her on an extra-long beach walk when this was all over.
Jimmy and Lucy came into the room and Austin joined them at the conference table. “I’ve been thinking,” he said. “What else do you have on those two missing nurses?”
“Don’t think Trisha is our gal?” Lucy asked.
“Maybe an accomplice, but…”
“I’m with you,” Jimmy said, squeezing a rubber ball in his left hand over and over. On the release, it let out a tiny squeak that made Itsy perk up her ears. “She doesn’t have the evil in her.”
Lucy gave Jimmy an annoyed look. “What is that ball?”
He held it up, squeezing it aggravatingly close to her face. “For forearm and wrist strength. Missing my workout tonight and gotta stay swol.”
“Swol?” Austin asked.
“Jacked,” Jimmy said. “Strong.”
Lucy raised an eyebrow at him. “You sure that’s what you want to be saying?”
He gave her a puzzled look.
She smirked. “You’re strengthening your wrists and forearms to stay jacked? Sometimes I think you have a muscle mass where your brain should be.”
Jimmy gently wrapped his knuckles against the side of his head. “Nope. One-hundred-percent community-college educated, grade-a brain matter.”
Austin wanted to tell them to get a room.
Ridley came in, a weary look on his face. “That Baxter is a real shitheel, but he’s no kidnapper.”
Austin asked, “Jimmy, were you able to get dates on those google searches?”
“Samantha found them, but why does it matter?” Jimmy shrugged. “She ran the searches about a week after she left the bones on the beach.”
Austin considered this. “She could have been googling to see what kind of coverage she was getting in the media. But also… hmm… it’s possible she was actually trying to learn something.” He turned to Ridley. “Did Sheriff Daniels have any luck with TaskRabbit?”
“Nothing yet. FBI is leaning on them, but… no. What are you thinking?”
Austin walked to the whiteboard, then traced a line with his finger from the picture of Trisha Simone to the photo of Allie Shreever. “So we know Trisha dropped Allie’s bones on the beach, but so far we have nothing tying her to the Shreever crime scene, correct?”
“Correct,” Ridley said.
“And we have the shoe print in the Green house, which could be a match. But it’s not like women’s size eight are especially rare.”
“Correct.”
“What I’m thinking is, why would Trisha search for the bags and The Holiday Baby Butcher after she’d already left the bones on the beach? I’m thinking TaskRabbit. Maybe someone hired Trisha to drop off the bones? What if she knew it was shady but did it anyway? Then, when she heard about the discovery of the dead baby in Hansville, and then the second kidnapping, she started googling and found the Lorraine D’Antonia case? Then she realized, ‘Oh no, I left a Thanksgiving bag.’”
“It’s possible,” Ridley said, “But if so, she knows who hired her and is still withholding info.”
Austin nodded.
Samantha burst through the door. “Holy freaking hell, bros and brodettes.” As usual, she was carrying a laptop, but this time she had it cradled in her palms as though she was carrying a delicate Faberge egg on a velvet pillow.
Before she’d said another word, she turned her laptop around. Austin stared blankly. It appeared to be a Facebook post.
“So, remember how I said that Mary Bonner isn’t on any social media?”
Austin nodded. Mary Bonner was one of the two nurses who’d missed work at the birthing center where both Allie Shreever and Joshua Green had been born.
“You found her?” Jimmy asked.
“Not exactly. But occasionally people are on a platform, get tagged in a post or photo, then leave the platform. The tag linking to their profile disappears, but their name is still there. On Facebook, it turns from blue to gray when this happens. In search, I didn’t find a single reference to Mary Bonner—other than ones out of state—but I also got a list of all the nurses she’d worked with. So I searched for Jessie Johnson. She’s another nurse at St. Michael’s.”
Austin was confused. “Why’d you search for her?”
“Ridley got me their work schedules. In the last year, Jessie Johnson shared more shifts with Mary Bonner than anyone else. Thought maybe I’d find a mention of Mary in Jessie’s social. This post is a photo from the nursing party last Christmas. Only a year ago. It’s captioned ‘St. Michael’s Birthing Team, Christmas Party.’”
Ridley sidled up next to her. “Please tell me Mary Bonner is in that picture.”
“She’s not, but she’s in a grayed-out tag. She was tagged in this photo—probably because she was at the party—then left Facebook.”
“Okay, so what’s the big deal?” Austin asked.
“Look.” Samantha pointed at the section below the photo.
There were dozens of comments, replies, and replies to the replies. Austin scanned the comments, shaking his head, wondering why this was so important. His eyes stopped suddenly on a comment from Myrian Brightstone, the other nurse who’d missed work in the last couple days.
Actually, they stopped on four words in the middle of a long comment: The Holiday Baby Butcher.
