Split Second
		 72 
As the time moved to 10:26, a man appeared from the same doorway King had come through. John Bruno looked confused, frightened and ready to vomit. King could relate; he wanted to throw up too. He and Bruno were the Christians awaiting the lions as the bloodthirsty crowd eagerly anticipated the coming slaughter. When King approached him, Bruno instantly recoiled. “Please, please don’t hurt me.”
“I’m not going to hurt you. I’m here to help.”
Bruno looked at him with a bewildered expression. “Who are you?”
King started to say something and then stopped. How exactly could he explain this? “I’m your Secret Service agent,” he finally said.
Surprisingly Bruno seemed to accept this without question. “What’s going on?” asked Bruno. “Where are we?”
“We’re in a hotel. And something is about to happen. I’m not exactly sure what.”
“Where’s the rest of your men?”
King looked at him blankly. “I wish I knew . . . sir.” This was all beyond insane, but what else was he supposed to do? And he had to admit, his demeanor as an agent had come back more easily than he would have thought.
Bruno saw the room’s exit door. “Can’t we just leave?”
“Uh, no, that wouldn’t be a good idea.” King was watching the clock as it moved to 10:29. Eight years ago Ritter was in front of him, dealing with the adoring crowd. King wasn’t going to make that mistake with Bruno. He led him over to the rope. “I want you to stand behind me. Whatever happens, just keep behind me.”
“Yes, absolutely.”
Actually King wanted to get behind him. After all these years here he was: a damn human shield again.
He pulled the gun from his pocket. If the bullets weren’t real, he had no chance. He eyed the velvet rope. He took a step forward. He was within an inch of it now, ironically almost in the exact same spot Ritter was in when Ramsey shot him. As the hand moved to 10:30, King chambered a round.
“Well, bring on the fat babies to kiss,” mumbled King. “Just bring it on.”
As Michelle peered around the corner, she saw the man standing outside the door to the Stonewall Jackson Room. He was armed with a pistol and rifle and looked to be the man who’d impersonated the police sniper in the tree before joining Parks in trying to kill her. She couldn’t see his face clearly, but she suspected this man was Simmons. If so, she had an advantage. Should she jump out and tell him to freeze? He might get a shot off and be lucky enough to hit her. And then she looked up and saw the sentry glance at his watch and smile. That could only mean . . .
She rolled out, her pistol aimed at his chest. She did tell him to freeze, but she modified that approach somewhat by firing at the same time as she cried out. The slugs hit him right in the pecs; he yelled out and dropped. Michelle ran forward, reached the fallen man, kicked his weapons away, knelt down and checked his pulse. The booted foot came up and caught her on the shoulder, and Michelle tumbled back and lost her gun.
The man staggered up, grasping at his chest. How could that be? She’d nailed him squarely in the upper torso. She answered her question almost immediately as she struggled to her feet. Body armor. She lunged for her gun but so did he. They crashed into each other, and he got a stranglehold around her neck.
“This time,” he hissed in her ear, “you’re going to die, bitch.” It was the man who’d tried to kill her in her truck.
She couldn’t match him in strength, so she decided to use her advantage. She jammed her elbow into his left side, right where she believed she’d shot him that night. He moaned and his grip broke and he went to his knees. She kicked away from him, slid across the floor and fumbled for her gun. As her hands closed around it, she turned and saw Simmons rise up and pull a knife from his belt.
She aimed and fired, and the round hit him in the dead center of the forehead. She dragged herself over to him. As she stared down at his body, she had an idea. It just might work.
