Split Second
		 65 
It was 2:00 A.M., and the person at the window raised a gun, took aim at the bulky figure lying in the bed and shot through the window, the glass tinkling as it broke. The slugs tore into the bed, blowing feathers into the air from the down comforter.
Roused from sleep by the shots, Michelle fell off the couch and onto the floor. She’d dozed off while going through Joan’s notes, yet was now instantly alert. Realizing someone had just tried to kill her, she pulled her gun and fired back at the window. She heard footsteps racing away and crawled toward the window, listening intently as she did so. She reached the wall and cautiously peered over the windowsill. She could still hear the strides of the person running away, and he also seemed to be wheezing. To her expert ears, his strides were curious, as though the runner was wounded or injured in some way. Whatever the cause, they weren’t normal. They were more like disjointed lunges, and her mind played with the idea that either she’d hit the would-be assassin or he’d already been wounded when he came to kill her tonight. Could it be the man she’d shot in her truck, the one who’d done his best to wring her neck? Perhaps the man who called himself Simmons?
She heard a vehicle start up and didn’t even try to race to her truck and follow it. She had no idea if anyone else was out there waiting. She and King had run into one ambush that way. She had no desire to repeat the mistake.
She went over to the bed and looked down at the mess. She’d taken a nap there earlier, and the covers and thick pillows had gotten balled together. To the shooter it must have looked like her sleeping there.
Yet why try to kill her now? Were they getting too close? She hadn’t done all that much. Sean certainly had found out more than—
She froze. King! She grabbed her phone and dialed his number. It rang and rang but there was no answer. Should she call the police? Parks? It could be that King was just sleeping hard. No, her gut told her otherwise. She ran for her truck.
The alarm woke King. Groggy for a moment, he quickly became alert and sat straight up. There was smoke everywhere. He jumped up, then fell to the floor trying to breathe. He made it to the bathroom, soaked a washcloth and draped it over his face. He crawled back out, braced his back against the wall and, using his legs, levered the bureau away from the door. He touched the door to make sure it wasn’t hot and then cautiously opened it.
The outside hallway was full of smoke, and the smoke alarm continued to shriek. Unfortunately it wasn’t connected to a central monitoring station, and the single volunteer fire department station that serviced the area was many miles away. And his house was so remotely situated no one may have noticed it was on fire. He crawled back inside his bedroom with the idea of getting to the phone, but the room was so smoky he lost his bearings and was afraid to venture farther in. He slithered back out into the hallway and along the catwalk. He could see sparks and red flames down below, and he prayed the stairs were passable. Otherwise, he’d have to jump, possibly into an inferno, and that wasn’t a very appealing idea.
He heard sounds coming from down below. He was coughing from smoke inhalation and desperately wanted to get out of the house, but he was still aware this could be a trap. He clenched the gun and shouted out, “Who’s down there? I’m armed and I’ll shoot.”
There was no answer, which fueled his suspicions even more until he looked out the big front window as he lay on the catwalk. He saw the flashing red lights in his front yard, and he could hear the sirens of other fire trucks coming. Okay, help was here, after all. He reached the stairs and looked down. Through the smoke he could make out firefighters in bulky overcoats and helmets, with tanks strapped to their backs and masks covering their faces.
“I’m up here,” he shouted. “Up here!”
“Can you make your way down?” called out one fireman.
“I don’t think so, it’s a wall of smoke up here.”
“Okay, just stay there. We’ll come for you. Just stay there and stay down! We’re bringing the hoses in now. This whole place is on fire.”
He heard the whoosh of spray from fire extinguishers as the men charged up the stairs. King was sick to his stomach and nearly blind from the smoke in his eyes. He felt himself being picked up and hauled swiftly down the stairs. In another minute he was outside and sensed people hovering over him.
“Are you okay?” one of them said.
“Get him some damn oxygen,” said another. “He’s breathed in a ton of carbon monoxide.”
King felt the oxygen mask being placed over his face, and then he had the sensation of being lifted into the ambulance. For a moment he thought he could hear Michelle calling out to him. And then everything went black.
The sirens, flashing lights, radio staccato and other “sound effects” immediately stopped as the fireman hit the master switch on the control box with one hand and took the gun from King with the other. Everything became quiet once more. The fireman turned away and went back to the house, where the smoke was already starting to peter out. It had been a very carefully controlled “fire,” with all the elements of the inferno artificially created. He went inside the basement, set the ignition switch on the small device next to the gas lines and left the house. He climbed into the back of the van, and it immediately drove away. The van reached the main road and accelerated, heading south. Two minutes later the small explosive device went off in King’s basement, setting off the gas lines, and the resulting explosion ripped Sean King’s beautiful home apart for real.
The fireman pulled off his helmet and mask and wiped his face.
Buick Man looked down at the unconscious King. The “oxygen” he’d been given included a sedative.
“It’s good finally to see you, Agent King. I’ve waited a long time for this.”
The van sped on into the darkness.
