WHAT CALLAHAN HAD in the way of evidence was so overwhelming that both Eastland and Huey are doing plea deals to avoid the death penalty,” said Bogart.
They were in the same conference room at Quantico where they had first taken a look at Melvin Mars’s case. They were all present, including Davenport and Milligan. Mars was there too.
“The Three Musketeers apparently wanted to document thoroughly what they were going to do,” said Milligan. “Photos of themselves with the bombs. Handwritten letters to each other about what they were planning and more letters after the fact detailing how they did it. Even a film where they bragged about what they had done. They were really proud of it. Maps of the NAACP office and the church. A list of the victims with check marks against their names. And on and on. Unbelievable.”
Bogart added, “And all of them in KKK outfits. Even photos of them and Huey Sr. holding nooses and signs with racial slurs on it. How stupid can you get?”
Decker said, “They thought they were untouchable. Huey’s father was the man in Mississippi. Eastland’s parents were rich. McClellan was the attack dog everybody was scared to death of. And they believed they were doing God’s work.”
“More like the devil’s work,” interjected Jamison.
“But he’s dead and the other two are heading to prison. Some untouchables,” said Bogart.
Mars smiled.
Decker glanced at him. “What?”
“Just thinking of those two pricks in orange jumpsuits mopping floors and living the rest of their lives in an eight-by-ten. Pretty sweet.”
Jamison said, “Speaking of, what about Mary Oliver?”
Bogart said, “She cut a deal. But she’s still doing considerable jail time.”
“Good,” said Davenport. “When she knocked on my door I thought nothing of letting her in. Next thing I know some guy grabbed me and held something to my nose. And everything went black. I thought I was dead for sure.”
“You would have been,” said Bogart. “If we hadn’t found you. And you can thank Decker for that.”
Davenport smiled warmly at him, but Decker didn’t seem to notice.
“What about Melvin?” asked Jamison.
Bogart straightened in his chair. “Melvin, you will not be going back to prison. After this all came out in the news and your role in finding the truth was prominently mentioned, Texas has no interest in trying to send you back to jail.”
“But what about his lawsuit for damages?” asked Decker.
“Glad you brought that up,” said Bogart. “We had DOJ lawyers get involved. It appears that because you are now quite the hero, Melvin, Texas does not want to be seen as denying you just compensation for what happened to you. Meaning your wrongful incarceration, and then your almost being killed at the prison due to a conspiracy involving some of the guards. Thus they have made an offer that I said I would share with you. Keep in mind that DOJ lawyers told the state to err on the side of extreme generosity, considering how much you could have made playing in the NFL.”
Bogart withdrew a slip of folded paper from his pocket and slid it across to Mars. Mars looked down at it for a few long seconds.
“You might as well open it, Melvin,” said Decker.
“The suspense is killing me,” added Jamison.
Mars slowly unfolded the paper and stared down at the number written there. Under his breath he counted the zeros.
“Holy shit,” said Decker, who was looking over his shoulder.
Jamison jumped up to look and nearly collapsed to the floor. “Mother of God.”
Mars looked up at Bogart. “I never would have made this much playing in the NFL for twenty years.”
“I have to say that the federal government chipped in quite a bit too. And it’s all tax-free. A good faith gesture from Uncle Sam. So you get to keep it all.”
Decker slapped him on the back. “How does it feel to be stinking rich, Mellow?”
Mars grinned and then started laughing. And he couldn’t stop. They all joined in, and people walking up and down the halls on serious business stopped and stared at the room, wondering what could be so damn funny.
*  *  *
A week later Decker drove Mars to the airport in Washington. He was wearing new clothes and had two suitcases full of additional outfits, all brand-new and tailored to his imposing physique.
“I really can’t believe this is happening to me, Decker.”
“Believe it, because when you open your eyes tomorrow it’ll all still be there.”
“I wish you’d take some of the money. Hell, you earned it. I’d still be in prison but for you.”
“Melvin, I suck at money management. I’d probably lose it in a few days.”
“Then I’ll set aside a chunk in an account for you. I’ll invest it. When I was in prison I followed the markets. My degree was in business. I’ll do right by you.”
“Whatever you want to do, you do. And I appreciate it.”
They drove for some minutes in silence as Decker navigated rush-hour traffic.
“So you’re heading back to Texas for a bit, and then what?”
“I know the old house is pretty much burned down, but I wanted to see it one more time.” He paused. “After that I thought I might head to Alabama.”
“Alabama? You mean Tuscaloosa?”
“No. I mean to where the Montgomerys lived.”
Decker looked at him curiously. “Okay. And for what reason?”
“I made some calls. Turns out the Howling Cougars need a running backs coach.”
“Tommy Montgomery’s team?”
Mars nodded. “He lost both his parents. Callahan killed his mother. I sort of feel responsible.”
“But you’re not.”
“But I still want to do it. And I’ve got the money to help Tommy. I’ll set up a trust for him. No reason he should suffer.”
“No reason at all. That’s very nice of you, Melvin.”
“You think I might make a good coach?”
Decker stared at him for a few moments before looking away. He knew Mars simply wanted a little encouragement, that was all. The “old” Decker could have given it with no trouble at all. The words would have just come to him easily. The “new” Decker had to work a lot harder to get there. While his memory had become perfect, much of the rest of his brain, the parts that picked up social cues and emotions and all the little messages that most folks took for granted in understanding, were far from perfect. But when he looked back at Mars a powerful memory took hold of him. It was Melvin Mars, the Longhorns’ star running back, trampling over the Buckeyes’ Decker on his way to yet another glorious touchdown. That gridiron connection made the jumbled words in his head straighten out into a clear line of thought.
He said, “Let me see. One of the greatest college running backs of all time. Heisman finalist. And a guy who would’ve made the NFL Hall of Fame first ballot. I wonder what the hell a high school football team sees in you.”
Mars chuckled embarrassedly. “I knew how to run the ball, Decker. I just don’t know if I can teach other people how to do it.”
“I think Tommy will be in good hands.”
They reached the airport and Decker helped Mars with his bags. The two men faced each other in front of the terminal.
“I guess this is goodbye. At least for now.”
Decker said, “For now. But don’t disappear on me.”
“Come on down to ’Bama and watch the Howling Cougars play. Bring Jamison and Bogart.”
“That’s a deal.”
They looked at each other awkwardly for a moment until Mars gave a bear hug to Decker, which he tentatively returned.
Mars said, “I don’t know how I can ever thank you, man. I’ve never had a better friend, not in my whole life.”
“Quite an admission for a Longhorn to make to a Buckeye.”
“You know what I mean.”
Decker didn’t have to hesitate this time. Keeping in his head that memory of their playing against each other he said, “I know what you mean, Melvin. And I feel the same way.”
“You never know, we might hook up sometime. I’m starting to like this investigation stuff.”
“You’re actually good at it.”
“You take care of yourself.” Mars cracked a smile. “And don’t get too skinny.”
“Don’t lose any sleep over that possibility.”
They hugged once more, and then Mars picked up his bags and walked into the airport terminal.
Decker watched him go until the big man disappeared from view.
Then he climbed back into his car but didn’t drive off right away.
He turned on the radio. The station was turned to NPR.
He thought back to last New Year’s Eve when he had done this same thing. When he had heard a story that had changed his life and so many others’. But most importantly, the life of Melvin Mars.
He glanced once more in the direction of the terminal and dialed up the image of Melvin Mars telling him that he was the best friend he’d ever had.
He suddenly felt like he had when he’d walked onto that gridiron on opening day. When eighty thousand people were cheering him, Amos Decker, or so it had seemed.
Except for the day he’d married his wife and the day his daughter was born, that experience had been the best he had ever felt in his whole life.
Now that amazing NFL moment had been pushed back to a distant fourth place.
After Melvin Mars being his new best friend.
