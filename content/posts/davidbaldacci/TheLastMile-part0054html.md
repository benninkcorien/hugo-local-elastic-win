CHAPTER

I’M HAVING THE local police post round-the-clock security at the entrance to the motel, Amos,” said Bogart. “I should have done that after they took Davenport,” he added apologetically. “I had someone posted outside Melvin’s and Jamison’s doors, but not yours. I just didn’t think anyone would go after you.”
He and Decker were walking together down the hall of the hospital.
“It’s okay,” said Decker. “I’m good to go.”
“So it was Roy Mars?”
Decker nodded. “I think we can safely say that. Although I’d like to know his real name.”
“Wouldn’t we all.”
They left the hospital, got in Bogart’s car, and drove off.
Bogart glanced at Decker as they hit the main road.
“How are you feeling?”
“Stupid and slow. So my status hasn’t changed since we got on this case.”
“I mean physically.”
“It hurts, but I’ve felt worse. A lot worse. Look, we need to get all of the arrest records for Charles Montgomery.”
“We have the major ones. The ones that led to his execution.”
“I want the minor ones. The ones where he skipped bail. We have some of those details, but I need it all.”
“You think that’s important?”
“We have to trace the connection between Roy Mars and Montgomery. It wasn’t random. Which means it’s important. If we can find that connection we may discover who’s behind this. We get that, then the whole thing starts to unravel.”
“But maybe it has something to do with the murders that Montgomery was convicted of.”
“No, those were fairly recent. Whatever the connection with Roy Mars, I believe it goes back forty years or more.”
“That may be true,” conceded Bogart. “But that long ago, finding detailed records will be very difficult.”
“Montgomery got back from Vietnam in 1967. He mustered out of the Army shortly thereafter. Then he was involved in a series of petty crimes.”
“But he told us he was having headaches. Messed up from the war. Maybe he was rebelling. He was young and stupid.”
“Did Montgomery strike you as stupid?”
“No, but he was a lot older, more hardened, when we met with him. A young punk back then, he was probably capable of anything.”
“I think the guy we saw hadn’t changed much from when he was young. He fought in Vietnam and was wounded. He was no punk. He was a soldier who’d been through hell and back. And there’s something else too.”
“What?” said Bogart quickly.
“I’m having trouble pulling it out.”
“What, your brain going wacky on you?”
“My brain is wacky, all the time.”
“I meant, is it starting to work like the minds of the rest of us poor shmucks?”
“It was something,” said Decker, ignoring Bogart’s comment. “Something I saw or heard.” He touched the bruise on the side of his head. “Maybe Roy hit me harder than I thought.”
“You’ll think of it. In the meantime I’ll dig up as much detail as I can on Charles Montgomery.”
They drove on.

Later that evening, Mary Oliver met them all for dinner at a restaurant a few blocks from the motel.
Milligan looked at Decker’s face and said, “Damn. I think you’re lucky he didn’t crack your skull.”
“He probably wanted to,” said Decker. “But if he wanted me dead, he could have just slit my throat.”
Mars put down the knife he was holding to cut his salad.
“Sorry, Melvin,” said Decker, noting this.
“Hey, it is what it is. My old man’s nuts.”
“No. He knows exactly what he’s doing and why. He understands that him getting you out of jail caused these folks to come after you. They want what was in the safe deposit box.”
“So he has those contents?” asked Oliver.
“Probably,” said Decker. “I mean, not on him, but somewhere. Somewhere safe that only he knows.”
Oliver said, “If we could find him, he could take us to it. Then we could go after whoever’s implicated by those contents. They must have been the ones who took Lisa.”
Milligan added, “Well, that’s easier said than done. We went over Decker’s room and didn’t find one usable print or shoe mark. The guy’s a pro. No one saw him come and no one saw him go. And the lock was expertly picked.”
“He is a pro,” said Decker. “And he knows who’s after him, and he knows what they want.”
“But how do we find him?” asked Oliver. “There must be some way.”
“He’s been watching us. He knows about us. Knows we’re the FBI. He knows we’re investigating all of this. I think he must be close by.”
Milligan said, “If he is, we should be able to find him. We have a description. And the town’s not that big.”
“But he also likely knows every bit of this place,” pointed out Jamison. “And there are probably lots of abandoned houses and farms in the area where he could be staying.”
Decker looked at her oddly. “That’s true.”
“That he knows lots of abandoned places to stay?”
“That he might know one abandoned place to stay.”
“You don’t mean my old house?” said Mars.
“Why not?”
“It’s too obvious, for one.”
“So obvious no one’s checked it?” said Decker.
“But you were there,” pointed out Jamison. “And we later went with you and Melvin.”
“But no one’s watching it all the time,” said Decker. “No one’s watching it right now. And if he wanted to hide the contents of that box?”
Oliver said, “You think it might be somewhere there?”
“There’s no guarantee, but it might be worth a look.” He glanced at Mars. “Can you think of any location there that might be a good hiding place?”
Oliver pulled her phone out of her pocket and looked at the screen. “This is about Melvin’s lawsuit.” She typed in a response and smiled at Mars. “Things are looking up, Melvin. I’ve got a friend in the state government. She just let me know that the state correctional system got my motion on your punitive claim and apparently the whole department is in an uproar, running around like chickens with their heads cut off. That means they know they’re vulnerable. And that also means they might come to the settlement table sooner rather than later.”
“Well ain’t that a miracle!” said Mars.
“I think public opinion is on your side now.”
Decker said, “That is good news but let’s not lose focus. Melvin, can you think of any place in the house it could be?”
Mars said, “I can’t think of anything off the top of my head. The house ain’t that big and I never had cause to hide anything.”
“How about in the garage?”
“Well, there was a loose board in the wall next to the door leading from the kitchen. I remember I looked in there once when I was a kid and saw an old coffee can. It didn’t mean anything to me. And I doubt my dad was hiding an old coffee can.”
“Well, it’s worth a look. Melvin and I can go check it out later tonight.”
Bogart said, “Todd can go with you, just in case. I’m expecting to get in some information on Montgomery shortly. Alex, Mary, and I can go over it while you guys are checking out the house.”
“Sounds like a plan,” said Mars.
