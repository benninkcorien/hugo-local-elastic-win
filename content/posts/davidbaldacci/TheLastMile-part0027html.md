MARS KEPT SHAKING his head in disbelief.
“Somebody just killed her? Blew up her house?”
Decker nodded.
They were sitting in the lobby of the hotel with Jamison and Davenport.
“But you said her son is okay?” said Mars.
“He’s fine, other than losing both his parents on pretty much the same day.”
“And you really think someone murdered her?”
“If not, it’s the biggest coincidence I’ve ever seen. And I don’t even believe in little coincidences.”
“Do you know who might have done it?”
“Whoever was paying her off, with Cartier watches and expensive clothes, and promises of a better life with her son.”
“So you think Tommy might be in danger?” asked Jamison.
“Bogart has state troopers looking after him,” replied Decker. “I doubt his mother told him anything, but whoever killed her can’t be certain of that. It was clear when we spoke to Tommy that he just thought it was insurance money.”
Mars glanced at him. “What do we do now?”
At that moment Bogart walked into the room looking agitated and upset.
Jamison said, “What is it? Not another murder?”
Bogart shook his head and dropped into an unoccupied chair next to Davenport. “No, it’s not that,” he said, not meeting any of their gazes. “It’s actually more complicated.”
Decker eyed him closely. “You want to tell us?”
Bogart lifted his gaze to Decker’s. “I just got a call from D.C. We have been officially pulled from this case.”
“What?” exclaimed Jamison and Davenport simultaneously.
“Let me rephrase that. HQ does not see this as a case. Not an open one. Mr. Mars has been cleared. The real killer has confessed and paid the ultimate price. That’s it. They want us back home.”
“But what about Regina Montgomery’s death?” said Decker, still watching Bogart.
“Irrelevant, at least to them. An accident, nothing more. And certainly not the jurisdiction of the FBI.”
Mars looked around at each of them before his gaze settled on Bogart. “So what exactly does that mean, Agent Bogart?”
“That exactly means that we pack up and leave and head back to Quantico. I’m sorry for the way this has turned out. It’s not how I intended it to happen. I’ll let Milligan know. He can leave directly from Texas.”
“Well, he’ll be ecstatic about that,” said Decker dryly.
Bogart rose and held his hand out to Mars, who rose and shook it.
“I’m sorry to be leaving in this way, Mr. Mars. It’s not how I would have done it, if it were my choice. But I wish you the very best of luck.”
“Okay,” said a bewildered Mars. “Sure, thanks.”
Decker said, “Have a good trip, Agent Bogart.”
Bogart didn’t look that surprised. “So you’re not coming?”
“I don’t leave a case until it’s finished. So I’m staying here to see it through.”
“Decker, please listen to reason, you can’t do that,” said Bogart.
“I can do that. And I will do that.”
“But you work for—”
“I resign,” interrupted Decker.
Bogart took a deep breath.
“Have you really thought this through?”
“I did, though it didn’t take long.”
Bogart looked at the two women. “And what about you?” he asked.
Jamison said firmly, “I’m staying with Decker.”
Bogart’s gaze drifted to Davenport. “And you?”
Davenport didn’t look nearly as certain, but after giving Decker a sideways glance she said, without looking at Bogart, “I’m staying too.”
Bogart nodded slowly. “Seems like my team and project are out of business.”
“We’re sorry, Agent Bogart,” said Jamison.
Bogart actually smiled. “You may be. But he’s not,” he added, looking at Decker.
“It’s nothing personal,” said Decker. “But Charles Montgomery did not kill Roy and Lucinda Mars. I’m going to find out who did.”
“I wish you luck. And I wish I could stay and help you do it. But unlike you, I don’t have that option.”
He turned and left.
Mars quickly looked at Decker. “Hey, man, you don’t have to do this. I don’t want y’all to lose your job over me.”
“Right now my job is to find out what happened to your parents, Melvin,” said Decker. “Whether it’s under the auspices of the FBI or not doesn’t matter a damn to me.”
“But the dude is your friend.”
“And Agent Bogart is still my friend. And he’ll be perfectly fine. He’s obeying orders.”
“But they might not let you back in working with him after this is over.”
Decker glanced at Jamison before turning to Mars. “That’s our problem, Melvin, not yours.”
Davenport said, “What do we do now?”
Decker answered, “Since we’re no longer with the FBI, the police don’t have to cooperate with us.”
“That will make it a lot harder,” pointed out Davenport.
“Which is why we won’t tell the police that that’s the case,” continued Decker.
“Lie to the police?” exclaimed Davenport. “Look, I know I agreed to stay, but I’m not getting in trouble over this.”
“We aren’t going to lie. We aren’t going to say anything about it. We’re just going to continue on with the investigation as if nothing happened. If the police think we’re still working with the FBI, that’s their mistake.”
“But Decker,” said Davenport. “Surely Bogart is going to inform them that the FBI is leaving the field.”
Decker cast a glance in the direction of Bogart, who was waiting at the elevator bank and casting furtive looks in their direction.
“No, I don’t think he will.”
Jamison said, “Okay, to take up Lisa’s point, now what do we do?”
Decker turned his attention to her. “Catch a killer.”
“But how?”
“We have clues, we just need to run them down.”
“What clues?” said Davenport.
“A blown-up house. A four-door tan Toyota Avalon. And whatever the neighbors can tell us about the person or persons in that duplex. And we trace back the money that went to Regina.”
Mars said, “You really think that’ll provide answers?”
Decker stood. “What’s the key to winning on the football field?”
“Preparation,” said Mars automatically.
“That’s right. Well, in the investigation field preparation means looking at all the little details in the hopes that they deliver up the big answers. And in my experience, when you look for criminals, you have to dig deep in the shit. Because that’s where they live. Let’s go.”
He strode out of the room.
Mars looked at Jamison. “Damn, he really is always like that.”
