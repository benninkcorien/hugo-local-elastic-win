CHAPTER
59
59
TWO MALE OFFICERS got out. They were both in their forties, a bit gray around the temples, a bit soft around the middle. They walked up, one on either side of the car.
Bogart rolled down his window. He already had his FBI ID out.
The officer leaned in. “How you folks doing?”
“Just fine, Officer,” said Bogart.
The man looked at the ID. “Right. We heard y’all were in town. It’s why we’re here. Chief McClellan wanted to know if there was anything at all that we could do to assist you in whatever you’re investigating?”
“We appreciate that very much,” said Bogart. “But right now I can’t think of anything.”
Decker was staring out the passenger window at the officer parked there staring back at him. One of the man’s hands rested on the butt of his service pistol.
Decker gave him a nod and a smile.
Neither was returned.
The officer at Bogart’s window said, “Just as a matter of professional courtesy do you think y’all could find the time to come meet with the chief? He prides himself on knowing all that goes on here, and I think you might find him an asset to help you in whatever it is that brought you to our fine town.”
Though it was spoken as a request, the tone of the words suggested that a refusal would not be very welcome.
“Certainly,” said Bogart.
They followed the patrol car back to a different station from the one where they had met Pierce, parked, and then the officers escorted them inside and down the hall. One of them rapped on a door that was fronted with a plaque reading Roger G. McClellan, Chief of Police.
“Come on in,” said a firm voice.
The officer opened the door, motioned the four in, and then shut the door behind them.
The office was large, twenty by twenty, with fine paneling and shelves holding a lifetime of awards and commendations in the law enforcement field. One wall was the photo wall of fame, showcasing McClellan in the company of various dignitaries, professional athletes, and famous singers, mostly country and western. In one area of the space were leather chairs and a comfortable couch and a coffee table with an assortment of magazines on it, predominantly cop and gun publications.
The state flag of Mississippi stood in a holder behind the enormous, intricately carved desk.
There was no sign of the Stars and Stripes.
Sitting behind the desk was a tall man who, despite his advancing years, looked fit and trim. He was wearing his dress uniform, the chest festooned with medals and ribbons. His gray mustache was trimmed and his thinning hair was slicked back. His face looked like a slab of granite that had been worked over by rushing water for a couple of centuries.
He rose and put out a hand. “Chief McClellan,” he said, shaking hands with each of them. “Please, take a seat.” He came around the desk and directed them to places among the couch and chairs before sitting down across from them.
“Y’all want something to drink? Coffee ain’t half bad, but we got some bottled water too.”
They politely declined.
McClellan sat back and looked them over. “I appreciate you coming on in. Sure you can understand that when the FBI comes calling I prick up my ears.”
“Absolutely. I take it you talked to Ms. Pierce?” said Bogart.
“Hell, I didn’t need to rely on that. Fact is, in a small town, news travels fast. Eyes and ears everywhere.” He reached over with a long arm and picked up a mug off his desk and took a sip from it.
Decker noted that the cup was imprinted with the words Virtute et armis.
McClellan saw him looking and said, “Official motto of the great state of Mississippi.”
“‘By valor and arms,’” said Decker.
“You read Latin?”
“No, I just remember seeing it somewhere.”
McClellan put down the mug. “So what brings you folks here?” He gazed around until he stopped on Mars. “Now, I know you. But you’re not FBI.”
“No, I’m Melvin Mars.”
“Damn, yes you are. Watched you play football when you were in college. Now, I’m an Ole Miss grad, played ball for ’em too. Glad I never had to tackle you. Like a Mack truck with a Ferrari engine. Helluva player, son.”
“Thanks.”
Decker closed his eyes while McClellan was talking, and then a light seemed to click on in his head as he made the relevant connection.
Ole Miss.
He opened his eyes.
McClellan said, “And I heard about your, um, situation. Glad you’re out now. Seemed like quite an injustice.”
“I saw it that way,” said Mars tersely.
McClellan swiveled his attention back to Bogart. “So, anything you can tell me?”
“We’re just looking into some things from the past that may have bearing on a more recent case.”
McClellan nodded. “Look, I’m not going to waste your time, Agent Bogart. I’m busy and I know you’re busy. I know you’ve been making inquiries about the bombing of the church that took place here in 1968. As you know, no one was ever arrested. Damn frustrating. When I joined the force many moons ago I had a go at it, just like everybody on the Cain Police Force seems to do.”
“And did you make any progress?”
“Not a lick, but it wasn’t for lack of tryin’. It’s a black mark on the town’s reputation, I can tell you that. Would like nothin’ better than to solve the thing, but after all this time?” He shrugged. “So, do you see any daylight?”
Bogart shrugged too. “It’s early days yet.”
McClellan looked at Mars again. “And since Mr. Mars is here, am I to take it that he is in some way connected?”
“That remains to be seen. We have a long way to go and other stops to make.”
“Where might they be?” asked McClellan.
“Not in Mississippi. This is a multistate inquiry. I can tell you that if we require any assistance in Mississippi, you’ll be the first one we call.”
“Well, a man can’t ask for more than that.”
He rose and so did the others. They shook hands again.
McClellan lingered the longest on Mars. “Glad you got a second chance, young man. Sure you’ll make the most of it. Hope the future is good to you. Better’n the past. Just keep looking forward. Not back. You’ll do fine.”
Mars looked at him strangely but nodded.
They walked out of the police station and back to their car.
Jamison shuddered. “Okay, he was polite enough so why do I feel like I just had a powwow with a sociopath?”
Mars said, “And he wants me to focus on the future, not the past.”
“I think that particular message was meant for all of us,” said Decker.
“And he also made it clear that nothing happens in this town that he doesn’t know about,” said Bogart.
Jamison said, “And Pierce will have told him what we were asking about. He’s probably going to send over some thugs to grill poor Mrs. Ryan and she’ll tell them about the Three Musketeers reference. Then he’ll know he’s in the crosshairs.”
Bogart said, “I might need to call in some more agents. I’m feeling exposed here.”
“We shouldn’t have come in so hard,” said Jamison. “But then again, we didn’t know one of the major players was the freaking police chief.”
“And maybe we turn that to our advantage,” said Decker.
“How?” asked Bogart.
“Let’s send in the dog to flush the birds.”
“How do you propose to do that?” asked Bogart.
Decker said, “I’ll meet you at the hotel.” He turned and walked back into the police station.
