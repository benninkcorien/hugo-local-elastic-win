SO WHAT DID you think you’d accomplish?” said Bogart to Decker.
The two sat in Bogart’s room at the hotel in the town square of Cain.
Decker drank down a Coke and wiped his mouth. “I told him what I told him. He’s not going to stand pat. He’s going to do something. Make a call. Send an email. Get in a car. Jump on a plane.”
“You really think he’s going to crack? He struck me as a pretty hardened guy.”
“I told him somebody even tougher is after him.”
“Roy Mars?”
Decker nodded. “And did you notice something about McClellan’s office?”
“What in particular?” said Bogart.
“On his photo wall of fame.”
“There were lots of pictures. I saw one of him and Thurman Huey, in fact.”
“I wasn’t talking about that. I was talking about one that wasn’t there.”
“I don’t get that,” said Bogart.
“There was a picture on the wall that’s no longer there. You could see where the wall was darker.”
“Why would he take a picture down?”
“Only one reason,” said Decker. “We would have recognized whoever was in it.”
“Who the hell could that have been?”
“I don’t know.”
Bogart glared at him. “Why don’t I believe you?”
“And there’s something else. McClellan tried to act surprised, but he knew Roy was alive. I mean he really knew. Not just speculation.”
“How?”
“I don’t know, but McClellan is going to make a mistake. We just need to be there when he does.”
“And if, instead, he and his buddies get their acts together and stonewall us?”
“That’s always a possibility.”
“I wish that you had discussed your strategy with me before you went ahead and deployed it.”
“I was just trying to seize the moment. What do we know so far?”
“I put tracers on his phones and his Internet connections. I have local agents watching his movements. If he does snap and goes running or emailing to one of the other Musketeers, we’ll know about it. But so far, nothing.”
Decker checked his watch. It was late.
“I think we need to get some sleep.”
*  *  *
Melvin Mars was tossing and turning when his phone buzzed at two in the morning. He snatched it up and looked at the screen.
Out by the car in ten. We need to talk. Decker.
“Shit,” muttered Mars.
He struggled into his clothes and left his room. It was a short walk to the parking lot. He found the car and looked around.
“Mellow?”
Mars froze at the name. Then he slowly turned.
His father stood ten feet away, next to another parked car.
“How did you—” began Mars.
“I got your contact info off your buddy’s phone when I broke into his motel room before. He should really use a password. You just assumed the text was from Decker because I used his name.”
“Dad, what the hell are you doing?”
“Not here. Let’s take a ride.” He pointed to the car.
Mars took a step back.
“Come on, Mellow, if I wanted to hurt you I could have done it anytime I wanted.”
“Where are we going?”
“Just for a ride. Then I’ll bring you back here. I promise.”
“But do I get back breathing or not?”
“I promise, Mellow. I’m not going to hurt you. I figure I did a good enough job of that already.”
Mars looked around and then walked toward his father. They climbed into the car and Roy backed out, reached the main road, and accelerated.
There were no stars out, the clouds were gathering, and not another car was on the road.
Mars eyed his father. “You got a limp?”
“Yeah, getting old.” He glanced at his son as he drove. “You have to hate me, Mellow. If you don’t, something’s wrong in your head.”
“I want to try to understand why you did what you did.”
“I told the fat guy some.”
“Yeah, he told me some too, but not all. Probably to spare my feelings.”
Roy laughed. “I don’t have that problem.”
“You did with Mom.”
The smile vanished on Roy’s face.
“You killed her, didn’t you? Shot her in the face with my gun.”
“The cancer was going to eat her brain. We had no money for treatments. The doctors told us…”
“Where did you go to get the diagnosis?”
“Mexico. Your mom and me spent time there. And they had experimental stuff, but nothing to help her. And we didn’t want anyone in town to know. Just in case.”
“Decker said she might’ve been a slave in Cali. And that she stole that silver teapot when she got away.”
“The fat guy has a big brain, then. She wasn’t exactly a slave, but she wasn’t free either. They had plenty of money. She got fed. Had a roof over her head. But…she wasn’t free to go. And they weren’t exactly nice to her.”
“So how did she get away?”
“That’s how we met. I was down there working a job. The folks holding your mom knew the people I worked for. They had car problems. I went there to fix them. They lived in a damn castle, drove Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, never worked a day in their lives. But when I went there I found out about your mom. We had talks. Then we made plans. Then I got her out of there.”
“Did you kill them?”
Roy looked at him. “And would it matter to you if I did?”
Mars looked out the window.
Roy said, “We took the teapot, not to sell. You know we kept it. Your mom just wanted something from them, after all they did to her.”
“How could you have killed her, Dad?”
Roy noticeably winced. He pulled the car off the road, cut the lights, and put it in park.
“You think I woke up one morning and decided to shotgun her in the head? Do you!?”
“What I know is that you planned this meticulously. You killed some guy and made it look like you were dead too. And then you set me up to take the fall. Instead of playing in the NFL, I spent half my life behind bars. I was almost executed.”
“I wasn’t going to let them kill you, Mellow.”
Mars slammed his fists so hard against the dashboard that it dented.
“My damn name is Melvin.”
The only sounds for the next minute were the breathing of the two men.
“Okay, Melvin, everything you just said is true. I killed the dude. Your mom switched his dental records. I killed her. I set the bodies on fire. I got the chick and the motel dude to do what they did. I disabled your car. I framed you. You went to prison because of me.”
“Why? Why did you do that to me?”
“It was the safest place for you. Your mom thought so too.”
“Bullshit!” roared Mars.
In response, Roy pulled out his gun. But instead of pointing it at Mars, he laid it on the seat between them.
“Then pick up this gun, point it at my head, and pull the fuckin’ trigger, Mellow. If you got the balls.”
Mars looked down at the gun, disbelief on his features. Then he slowly reached down, picked it up, and pointed it at his father.
“Shit, you don’t even know how to hold a pistol the right way. It’s not a shotgun. Use your dominant hand to make the pull, the other to brace, even at this distance. Hell, it don’t matter, you can hardly miss from where you’re sitting. But my blood and brains will literally be on your hands.”
Roy calmly looked away and stared out the windshield, aimlessly whistling a tune under his breath.
Mars said, “I think you want me to kill you.”
“Part of me does. Just end it. I’m tired, Melvin. It’s been a long time. None of it good.”
“And the Three Musketeers?”
To this Roy laughed out loud. “Saw you going to talk to McClellan. How is old Roger? He likes dressing up with all those medals on his uniform. After he graduated from Ole Miss he got multiple deferments from ’Nam. Same for Thurman and Danny. Their dads saw to that. They were all way too busy back here killing coloreds to go fight the Vietcong. And the Vietcong fired back. Big, damn difference.”
“Were you in Vietnam?”
“You going to shoot me or not?”
Mars slowly lowered the gun and placed it on the seat between them.
Roy gave him a disdainful look and put the weapon away in his shoulder holster.
Mars said, “You were at the house. You saved us from that fire.”
Roy shrugged.
“Why?”
“Why not.”
“Because you don’t seem to be the sort who really minds people dying very much.”
“That was our house. Your mother’s and mine. They had no right to come there. And I told the fat guy I had your back.”
“That’s why you did all this, right? The ESPN thing?”
Roy shrugged. “You were so famous, Mellow. It was gonna happen one day. Your mother prayed every night that it wouldn’t, but in our hearts we knew those prayers were not going to be answered one day. And then that day came.”
“And did they contact you? Threaten you?”
“Let’s just say that they never let the grass grow under their feet.”
“But didn’t you have plastic surgery? That scar?”
Roy laughed. “I didn’t have two dimes to rub together. That scar was from a fight over a girl.”
“What girl?”
“Your mother. You’re right. I did kill the people who had her. All of them. They deserved it.”
“And Mom still went with you? A killer?”
“You wouldn’t ask that question if you saw what they did to her.”
“I thought you said it wasn’t that bad.”
“I lied. It was hell. She was the family hooker and maid. They even let the guests have a go.”
“Did you kill Regina Montgomery?”
“She was an idiot. All she needed to do was go off into the sunset. But before her husband was even fried she was out buying shit and screwed it all up.”
“Why did you approach them in the first place?”
“Isn’t it obvious? To keep you from being executed.”
“You let me stay in prison for twenty years.”
“But I wasn’t going to let them kill you.”
“Why?”
“Because I promised your mother I wouldn’t.”
“I just don’t get you. I don’t know who the hell you are.”
Roy turned to him. “All you need to know is that I loved your mother more than anything. I sacrificed everything I had for her. I would have done anything for her.”
“You killed her!”
Roy screamed, “Because she told me to!”
The interior of the car suddenly did not seem large enough to hold both men at the same time. Mars just stared numbly out the windshield, seemingly unable to turn his gaze toward his father.
Roy said in a strained voice, “And I did it. Because I always did anything she asked of me. Even that.” He turned to Mars. “She wasn’t the only one who died that night. Because I died too.”
“And you put me in prison.”
Roy rubbed at his face. “They would have killed you, don’t believe otherwise.”
“Because they think I have what was in that safe deposit box.”
Roy’s features hardened. “Decker again? He’s one smart prick. I should’ve slit his throat when I had the chance.”
“Chocha,” said Mars.
Roy looked at him. “What about it?”
“It means playing possum. Playing dead. Like you did.”
“As I said, better prison than a grave. These guys were serious people. Kill you to look at you.”
“Did you bomb the church? And the NAACP office? Did you?”
“You’re getting way ahead of yourself.”
“Simple questions. Yes or no?”
“What, you want a confession?”
“They were little kids, Dad. In a choir.”
Roy looked away. “They weren’t supposed to be there. Choir practice ran late, I guess.”
“But you still did it.”
“That part was out of my hands.”
“Okay, so you’re completely innocent?”
Roy laughed. “You’ll never hear those words come out of my damn mouth.”
“Decker told McClellan that you were coming for them. To scare them.”
“Is that right? Like I could give a shit.”
“Really? Aren’t they the reason you had to kill Mom? I mean, if they weren’t around, if you’d had the balls to finish them off way back when?”
Roy stared down at his hands. “It wasn’t that simple.”
“So why don’t you tell me about it, Dad? You brought me out here. You obviously wanted to talk. So why don’t you tell me how a guy who married a ‘colored’ woman that he loved more than life itself could be part of a group that blew up black kids? Why don’t you tell me that?”
“Easy enough. I was a racist asshole. Just like McClellan and his buddies.”
“Was?”
“Until I met your mother.”
“What, then all your racist tendencies just vanished?”
“No. But I never hurt anyone like that again.”
“You hurt me! I’m black. You stole my life. Your own son.”
Roy turned to look at Mars. “The thing is, Mellow, you’re not my son. Your mother was pregnant when I rescued her.”
Mars sat there staring at him. “You’re not my father?” he finally managed to say.
“No. I’m not.”
“Then who was?” gasped Mars.
“A prick who raped your mom over and over. Until I made him stop. By slitting his throat.”
