Chapter 11
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Before Austin could react, Damian had his right forearm pressed into Ridley’s chest. He was half a foot shorter than the detective, and probably sixty pounds lighter. Not a small man, but next to the half-giant Ridley, he was laughably outmatched. With his left hand, Damian reached for Ridley’s throat. It never got there.
As Austin took his first step to intervene, Ridley deftly took a half step back, intercepted the hand coming for his throat, and twisted it so hard that Damian dropped to the floor, writhing in a ridiculous half flip and contorting his body to keep his wrist from breaking.
When Ridley let go, Lucy was all over the father, knee in his back, pressing his face into the couch. “You want me to cuff him?”
“Let him go,” Ridley said.
Lucy patted him down, then backed off.
Ridley yanked Damian up and pushed him back onto the couch. “That was not wise, Mr. Green.”
There were tears streaming down the man’s face. His wife had inched even further away from him on the couch, a look somewhere between disgust and horror spread across her face.
“Another move like that,” Ridley said, “and you’ll be in jail when we find your son. You don’t want that.”
“You told my wife where I was that night,” Damian said. He was trying to sound angry, but it came out more pathetic. “You did not need to do that.”
“Yes he did!” Deirdre shouted, slapping him across the shoulder. “You selfish prick!”
Clearly, Austin had missed something, but their distance on the couch now made more sense.
Ridley said, “First of all, Mr. Green, I can’t stress enough the extent to which it’s in your interest not to come at me again. If you’d attacked Lucy like that, trust me, you would not get a pass. You’d be in the back of a police car with an assaulting-an-officer charge. But I have two kids. I can understand your grief, assuming that’s what this is. I know how grief can flip to rage. It was important that I tell your wife that you were not, in fact, out of town on a business trip when your child was taken. Your initial alibi was a lie. Another poor decision. Another potential charge you now face. At this moment, every person on earth is a suspect, and it’s crucial that we have a complete picture of everyone who’s in Joshua’s life.”
“That bitch isn’t in Joshua’s life,” Deidre spat. “She’s in my husband's pants, apparently. And probably his wallet.”
Damian grimaced.
Now it all made sense. Damian Green was having an affair. He’d lied to Detective Calvin about it and, likely on the ride over, his alibi had fallen apart and Ridley had called Deirdre. It’s what Austin would have done. In his experience, people lied about sex more than anything else in the world. More than money and, shockingly, more than murder. He’d had hardened criminals who’d admitted to multiple murders lie about being bisexual. A father he’d arrested for drowning his teenaged son had denied dressing in women’s clothing—despite reams of photographic evidence—because he thought it made him look bad. In short, sex made people crazier than anything in the world.
Ridley surely knew this as well. And when crimes were fresh, a lot could be gained by observing the genuine emotional reactions of the suspects, the victims, or the victim’s families. Deirdre had found out her husband had been with another woman the night their son had gone missing, two weeks after she’d given birth. Ridley had wanted to put that pressure on their relationship right before they arrived to get the freshest responses possible. It was diabolical, sure, but good detective work.
Lucy knelt in front of the couch, between the couple, but she addressed Deirdre. “I’ve been cheated on. It sucks, I know. It hurts and—”
“I already knew he was having an affair,” Deirdre said. “But two weeks after bringing our son home from the hospital.” She glared at Damian. “You couldn’t wait a whole month before… Bastard…You’re such a bastard…”
She slumped back into the couch cushions like a deflated balloon. Then she sighed a long, weary sigh. “Can we just get on with this? We have to make this about Joshua.”
“Exactly,” Lucy said. “We’re here to find out everything we can so we can find your son.” She looked at Damian. “Find. Your. Son. You two need to grow the hell up right now.” Her tone was commanding, but also compassionate, a good combination.
And it seemed to work because Damian glanced apologetically at Deirdre, who sat up a little straighter and finally made eye contact with Ridley, who said, “Thomas Austin is here consulting for us because he’s an expert on infant abductions. He’s going to ask you some questions.”
Austin offered a reassuring smile, then said. “Take me back to the beginning. The night your son went missing.”
Over the next hour, Austin got the whole story. Though Damian tried to interrupt a few times, he was mostly well-behaved. And Deirdre struck him as reliable and, though she obviously drank consistently, she came off as more of a wine-mom than a drunk.
Since bringing Joshua home from St. Michael’s in Silverdale, Deirdre explained, she’d fallen into a reliable routine, one she’d followed the night he’d gone missing. That evening, she’d put Joshua to bed around 8:30 PM, texted her husband, who hadn’t replied, watched TV for an hour, had a glass of Merlot, then gone to bed. She’d awoken around midnight when she heard Joshua crying on the baby monitor she kept on her nightstand. At that time, there was no sign of anything wrong, except that he needed a diaper change and a bottle. By 1 AM or so, she’d rocked him back to sleep and returned to bed.
The next thing she knew she was awake, the first light of pre-dawn creeping through the curtains. She knew something was wrong when she checked the clock on her phone: 6:30 AM. Joshua had never gone more than four hours without waking her up. Her fears were confirmed when she opened the door to the nursery and felt a cold breeze. Joshua was gone, along with his baby blanket. The window next to the crib was open. She was certain it had been closed when she went to sleep. Nothing else was missing from the house. Other than what might have been a foot imprint in the carpet, the kidnapper left no trace.
Within minutes, she called the police. Then she called Damian, who—she made sure to point out—hadn’t answered. Detective Calvin arrived an hour later for the first interview.
“After that,” she concluded, “everything was a waking nightmare.”
Lucy asked, “Any family members you might have been arguing with recently, ex-boyfriends, that kind of thing?”
She glanced at Damian, who was shaking his head. “No, not that I can think of. My mom adores Joshua. Dad died when I was little, and my sisters live on the east coast.”
Lucy pulled the sketch out of her pocket, unfolded it, and handed it to Deirdre. “She look familiar at all?”
Deirdre studied the picture. “No.”
She handed it to Damian, who shook his head, then said, “Wait. I don’t know the woman, but I recognize this picture. Is this… I can’t remember where I saw it.”
Detective Calvin said, “You may have seen this sketch on the news. This woman is a person of interest in another case. We don’t know if they are related.”
Damian looked like he was going to stand, but a cautioning glance from Lucy made him relax into the couch. “She’s from the other kidnapping,” he said. “The baby who… oh, God.”
“The one who was killed a few days later,” Deirdre said. Her face trembled, then she let out a sharp, anguished cry. Pure pain.
“Like I said,” Ridley said sternly, “we do not yet have any reason to believe the cases are connected, but if you’ve seen this woman—a neighbor, a strange woman in the grocery store, someone at the hospital, a lady who delivers your mail—anything. Now’s the time to tell us. Look again and think hard.”
They did, both shaking their heads the whole time.
“I remember seeing the picture on the news report,” Damian said. “That’s it.”
Austin stuck his hands in his pockets, letting out a long breath. “Can I see Joshua’s room?”
Deirdre led them to the nursery, one door down from her bedroom. It was light blue, with yellow cartoon lions and bright pink elephants painted on the walls. As Deirdre had said, the crib was in the corner, next to the window, which remained open. The indent in the carpet wasn’t visible to the naked eye, but it had been sprayed with a black powder and surrounded with little red flags attached to pins.
Ridley pointed at it. “Too faint to cast, but there was a partial shoe print in the mud outside, women’s size eight, Adidas running shoes, consistent with the size of this indentation.”
Austin crouched down to study it. It was probably irrelevant since she was behind bars, but Lorraine D’Antonia also wore a size 8. So did roughly thirty percent of the women in the country, so it wouldn’t do a lot to narrow down the suspect list, even if they’d had one. The indentation was about three feet from the window, toe pointed to the center of the room, consistent with someone stepping in through the window toward the crib.
Austin asked, “What size do you wear, Ms. Gailhammer?”
“Six.” She lifted a foot up as though to prove this.
“Do you have a housekeeper?”
“Yes, but she hasn’t come since before he was born.”
“I don’t see what good this is doing?” Damian exclaimed from the doorway. “Why aren’t you out looking for the bastard?”
Ridley took him by the arm. “You and Ms. Gailhammer, why don’t you come back to the living room. Let our people work.”
When they’d left, Lucy turned to Austin. “What do you think?”
Austin pointed out the window. “With the road right there, this is a good spot to nab a kid. First story bedroom. Bush blocks most of the view of the window. Perp probably left the car running, pried the thing open, one foot into the room, grabbed the kid. Gone in two minutes, tops.”
Lucy gestured to the baby monitor, which sat on the changing table next to the crib. “Those things don’t record, do they?”
“They can, but that one looks pretty basic. First impression is this was highly-targeted. Of all the houses on the block, this one is the easiest. The perp somehow knew enough about the house to know it would be an easy break-in and that it didn’t have cameras, but it’s not sounding like a family member did this.”
Lucy nodded. “Exactly the same as the Allie Shreever case in Bremerton. First floor nursery, close to a road. Middle of the night. Family and friends cleared within a week. Feels targeted, but…”
“Damn.” Austin shook his head. He’d hoped to find easy evidence showing this case was unrelated to the Allie Shreever murder.
“Damian’s temper?” Lucy asked, holding up her phone. “Email from Samantha, our intern. She says security footage from his girlfriend's apartment puts him in Seattle the night this went down. But still.”
“It’s concerning, but…” He shook his head. “I don’t like him for this.”
Of course, they’d have to look into Damian and his mistress more thoroughly. It was possible he’d hired someone to take his son. Maybe he’d wanted out of the marriage and knew he’d never get custody of Joshua, so he’d had the kid stolen, planning to disappear with him and his mistress. It was worth a look, but Damian Green struck Austin as a hothead, a bad husband, but not a sociopath. “Was Joshua born at the same hospital as Allie Shreever?”
Lucy nodded. “They did, and I had the same thought. Maybe Ridley can head out there next.” Her phone dinged with a text. “You done here?”
Austin nodded.
“Then let’s go. Our only witnesses are ready to talk.”
