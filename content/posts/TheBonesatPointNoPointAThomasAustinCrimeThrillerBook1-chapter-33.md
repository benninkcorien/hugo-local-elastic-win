Chapter 32
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
Shielding the notebook from the rain, Jimmy flipped through the pages. The first page listed Anna Downey’s phone number, email address, and a mailing address for her newspaper.
Jimmy stuffed the notebook in his back pocket, then grabbed the radio on his belt. “Ridley, this is Jimmy, over.” He waited. The crackling of the radio mingled with the sound of the rain as a cold breeze chilled his face. His eyes were on the house, darting from the door to the window. Not a single sign of life. “Ridley, this is Jimmy, over.”
He checked his cellphone. No service.
He tried again. “Ridley, this is Jimmy. I found an abandoned vehicle and the notebook of Anna Downey at the Heron Street address. Requesting backup. Over.”
“Ji-immy… I… what….” He was pretty sure that was Ridley’s voice, but it was choppy and sporadic.
“Requesting backup at the Heron Street address. Off 360th. Over.”
“Give… wait… the… over. I…”
Jimmy clipped the radio back to his belt. From Ridley’s garbled reply, it seemed as though he’d heard him. Ridley and two other officers were also knocking on doors in the neighborhood and would be less than five minutes out. He had no special fondness for Anna Downey. But something was wrong. In fact—it hit him like a slap to the face—if Anna had shown up here and left her car and notebook, there was a chance Joshua Green was in that house. Alive. Right now.
He thought about Lucy. Lying in bed last night, she’d asked, “Why do you do this job, really?” He’d made a wisecrack of some sort, but finally admitted he really didn’t know. His dad was a cop, his uncles were state troopers, his mom was a cop. He’d never really thought about it. But it was this right here. Moments like this. This is why he’d become a police officer. He couldn’t wait for Ridley.
He crept around the side of the house, past the garage. The area had been cleared of trees, so the heavy rainfall pounded him, soaking him through to the skin in seconds.
On the back of the house, facing the Puget Sound, was a large picture window. The curtains were drawn. No light. No sign of life.
He heard something faint, a whistle, or maybe a bird. He spun around. Had it come from behind him? No, perhaps it had come from the house, but between the heavy rain and wind, it was difficult to tell.
He moved closer to the window. Leaned in. No sound from inside.
He crept around to the other side of the house, where a rusty screen door hung half off its hinge. He moved toward it. Another sound. Not a bird. It was a single, solitary squeal, like his baby nephews made seemingly at random, sometimes in delight, sometimes in discomfort. But he had no doubt: it was the sound of a baby.
He froze for half a second, unsure of what to do. Lucy would tell him to head back to the car, wait for backup. But Lucy herself would probably not follow that advice. He pulled back the screen and banged on the thin wooden door. “Kitsap County police, open up.”
Nothing. No more cries. Not another sound.
He tried the doorknob. Locked.
It was a thin wooden door, likely the same one that had been installed when this cabin was built in the eighties. The paint had been worn away by rain and age, exposing a grainy pine that had seen better days.
He glanced back at his car.
Then he heard another cry, this one sharper, more pained. A different tone.
Not a baby. An adult.
